Some classes got better valid accuracy when epoch is bigger, some didn't.** <br />\n\n\nLet's talk about first and third concolusions above. Why valid accuracy decrease when epoch increase? Does this sound familiar to you? <br />\nThis is overfitting, right? From the training result, we can see some classes are much harder to train, some are not. <br />\nEasy classes can easily get high valid accuracy when epoch is low. But at the same time, hard classes are still underfitting. <br />\nSo when the model get too confidence on easy classes, it might cause some error when it classifying the hard classes. <br />\nSince some of the kannada numbers are a little similar, so model migth classify the hard examples to easy classes. <br />\nThus, some of the easy classes start to overfitting, and of course, the accuracy start to decrease. <br />\n\nHow can we solve this problem? <br />\n\n**1. Use some speical loss fucntion, which will help model to not getting too confidence on easy class and improve underfitting on hard class.** <br />\n**2. Use more data.

This behavior will make the parameter of neuron won't be updated and just assign to its original value.

Although swish activation might wont help too much on small architecture(like I created in this kernel), but it might be helpful on deeper neural network architecture.\n\n<br />\n**Squeeze and Excitation neural network** <br />\n<br />\nSE net is an architecture proposed by J Hu. It can be divide in two parts, squeeze and excitation parts. \nIn very simple explanation, it aggregates feature maps across their spatial dimension and makes them as channel descriptor. And it can learn the importance of dependencies of each channels during training. \nThen multiply the weights to its corresponding channels of input tensor to enhance/decrease the importance. <br />\n<br />\nOriginal article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def _swish(x):\n    '''\n    x : input tensor\n    \n    return : swish activated tensor\n    '''\n    return tf.keras.backend.sigmoid(x) * x\n\n#helper function of Squeeze and Excitation block.\ndef _seblock(input_channels=32, se_ratio=2):\n    '''\n    input_channels : the channels of input tensor\n    se_ratio : the ratio for reducing the first fully-conntected layer\n    \n    return : helper function for entire se block\n    '''\n    def f(input_x):\n        \n        reduced_channels = input_channels // se_ratio\n        \n        x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(input_x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=reduced_channels, kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.Activation(_swish)(x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=input_channels, kernel_initializer='he_normal', activation='sigmoid')(x)\n        \n        x = tf.keras.layers.multiply([x,input_x])\n        \n        return x\n    return f\n\ndef _cn_bn_act(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1)):\n    '''\n    filters : filter number of convolution layer\n    kernel_size : filter/kernel size of convolution layer\n    strides : stride size of convolution layer\n    \n    return : helper function for convolution -> batch normalization -> activation\n    '''\n    def f(input_x):\n        \n        x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, strides=strides, padding='same', kernel_initializer='he_normal')(input_x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.Activation(_swish)(x)\n        \n        return x\n    \n    return f\n\n\ndef _dn_bn_act(units=128):\n    '''\n    units : units for fully-connected layer\n    \n    return : helper function for fully-connected -> batch normalization -> activation\n    '''\n    def f(input_x):\n        \n        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=units, kernel_initializer='he_normal')(input_x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)\n        x = tf.keras.layers.Activation(_swish)(x)\n        return x\n    \n    return f\n\ndef build_model(input_shape = (28,28,1), classes = 10):\n    '''\n    input_shape : input dimension of single data\n    classes : class number of label\n    \n    return : cnn model\n    '''\n    input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape = input_shape)\n    \n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=64)(input_layer)\n    #x = _seblock(input_channels=64)(x)\n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=64)(x)\n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=64)(x)\n        \n    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))(x)\n    x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)\n    \n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=128)(x)\n    #x = _seblock(input_channels=128)(x)\n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=128)(x)\n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=128)(x)\n    \n    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))(x)\n    x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)\n    \n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=256)(x)    \n    x = _seblock(input_channels=256)(x)\n    x = _cn_bn_act(filters=256)(x)    \n    \n    x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)\n    x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)\n    \n    x = _dn_bn_act(units=256)(x)\n    x = _dn_bn_act(units=128)(x)\n    output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=classes, kernel_initializer='he_normal', activation = 'softmax')(x)\n    \n    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[output_layer])\n    return model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Note**\n\nI prefer to add Precision and Recall into metrics.
