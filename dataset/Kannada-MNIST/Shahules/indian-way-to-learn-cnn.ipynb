Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more.\n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"datagen = ImageDataGenerator(\n        featurewise_center=False,  # set input mean to 0 over the dataset\n        samplewise_center=False,  # set each sample mean to 0\n        featurewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide inputs by std of the dataset\n        samplewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide each input by its std\n        zca_whitening=False,  # apply ZCA whitening\n        rotation_range=10,  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)\n        zoom_range = 0.1, # Randomly zoom image \n        width_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)\n        height_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)\n        horizontal_flip=False,  # randomly flip images\n        vertical_flip=False)  # randomly flip images\n\n\ndatagen.fit(X_train)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the data augmentation, i choosed to :\n\n   - Randomly rotate some training images by 10 degrees\n   - Randomly Zoom by 10% some training images\n   - Randomly shift images horizontally by 10% of the width\n   - Randomly shift images vertically by 10% of the height\n\nI did not apply a vertical_flip nor horizontal_flip since it could have lead to misclassify symetrical numbers such as 6 and 9."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## A breif Intro to CNN <a id='3' ></a>\n\nWe will first learn about the convolution operation\n**Edge Detection Example**\n![](https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-15-47-38.png?resize=673%2C358&ssl=1)\n\nSo, we take the first 3 X 3 matrix from the 6 X 6 image and multiply it with the filter. Now, the first element of the 4 X 4 output will be the sum of the element-wise product of these values, i.e. 10 x 1 + 10 x 0 + 10 x -1 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 0 + 10 x -1 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 0 + 10 x -1 = 0. To calculate the second element of the 4 X 4 output, we will shift our filter one step towards the right and again get the sum of the element-wise product.\nWe can see that after the entire operation the new matrix seperates the edges.\n### Padding\nwe can pad the image with an additional border, i.e., we add one pixel all around the edges. This means that the input will be an 8 X 8 matrix (instead of a 6 X 6 matrix). Applying convolution of 3 X 3 on it will result in a 6 X 6 matrix which is the original shape of the image. This is where padding comes to the fore:\n\n    Input: n X n\n    Padding: p\n    Filter size: f X f\n    Output: (n+2p-f+1) X (n+2p-f+1)\n\nThere are two common choices for padding:\n\n    Valid: It means no padding. If we are using valid padding, the output will be (n-f+1) X (n-f+1)\n    Same: Here, we apply padding so that the output size is the same as the input size, i.e.,\n    n+2p-f+1 = n\n    So, p = (f-1)/2\n\nWe now know how to use padded convolution. This way we don’t lose a lot of information and the image does not shrink either. Next, we will look at how to implement strided convolutions.\n\n### Pooling Layers\n\nPooling layers are generally used to reduce the size of the inputs and hence speed up the computation. Consider a 4 X 4 matrix as shown below:\n![](https://i2.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-from-2018-12-10-12-50-40.png?resize=271%2C93&ssl=1)\nApplying max pooling on this matrix will result in a 2 X 2 output.\n\n\n### CNN Example\n\nWe’ll take things up a notch now. Let’s look at how a convolution neural network with convolutional and pooling layer works. Suppose we have an input of shape 32 X 32 X 3:\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-from-2018-12-10-14-07-58.png?resize=767%2C200&ssl=1)\n\nThere are a combination of convolution and pooling layers at the beginning, a few fully connected layers at the end and finally a softmax classifier to classify the input into various categories. There are a lot of hyperparameters in this network which we have to specify as well.\n\nGenerally, we take the set of hyperparameters which have been used in proven research and they end up doing well. As seen in the above example, the height and width of the input shrinks as we go deeper into the network (from 32 X 32 to 5 X 5) and the number of channels increases (from 3 to 10).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### CNN\n\nI used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.\n\nHere is the link to original article.\n[credits](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/12/guide-convolutional-neural-network-cnn/)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Modelling <a id='4' ></a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Sequential()\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 32, kernel_size = (5,5),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu', input_shape = (28,28,1)))\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 32, kernel_size = (5,5),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu'))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization(momentum=.15))\nmodel.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.25))\n\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (3,3),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu'))\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (3,3),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu'))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization(momentum=0.15))\nmodel.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), strides=(2,2)))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.25))\n\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 32, kernel_size = (5,5),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu', input_shape = (28,28,1)))\nmodel.add(Conv2D(filters = 32, kernel_size = (5,5),padding = 'Same', \n                 activation ='relu'))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization(momentum=.15))\nmodel.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.25))\n\n\nmodel.add(Flatten())\nmodel.add(Dense(256, activation = \"relu\"))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.4))\nmodel.add(Dense(10, activation = \"softmax\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Unhide Above output to see the summary**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Optimizer\nIn simpler terms, optimizers shape and mold your model into its most accurate possible form by futzing with the weights.
