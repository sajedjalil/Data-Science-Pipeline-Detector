Hence, it is important to see if the raw features change over time in this dataset (and, if so, how much). If they do, it might be appropriate to use feature engineering or other mechanisms to derive features that account for their moment in time and extract the essential treats of samples so that prediction can be still meaningful even if new trend changes occur. For extracting the essence of features, auto-encoders could be used; the denoising auto-encoders are especially interesting due to the high noise that this trading dataset has, as well as variational auto-encoders, focused on extracting latent information from raw features.\n\nChoosing the right algorithm is also important, of course. For instance, if one looks at the success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in time series prediction problems, one sees that they leverage the relevance of recent samples (short memory) with key definining characteristics of older ones (long memory) to infer new responses. However, RNNs would be handy here if the test came just after the training in time, and for every new sample the previous ground-truth response was given, to update the model appropriately and avoid a massive deviation sonner. Hence, other algorithms, such as gradient boosting, which is state-of-the-art for many other tabular problems, could be preferred. Feed-forward neural networks with trainable or pre-trained auto-encoders may be a reasonable approach as well.\n\n\n### Initial practical approach and findings\n\nEvery feature could be observed separately in order to find changes in trends over times. However, since there are many features, as an approach, one can try to examine all features together, being aware that clear oversimplifications will be used, and that other checks should follow to confirm any hypothesis. The approach used here is to scale all features to have similar numeric importance (mean 0, standard deviation 1). Then, the mean value over features (grouped and averaged by date) is compared from one date to another.\n\nOne can notice that there is indeed a divergence of mean value over time, starting in 0.04 to 0.06 in the first dozens of dates, reaching 0 near the day 120 and going down in an irregular manner, to finish with a value close to -0.04 by the final day (499), after a long period near to -0.02."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nscaled_x = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(full_x_train), columns=full_x_train.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mean_scaled_value_per_day = scaled_x.mean(axis=1).groupby(date_series).mean()\nmean_scaled_value_per_day.plot(title='Mean scaled feature value per day', ylabel='mean feature value')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"smoothed_mean_scaled_value_per_day = pd.Series(data=[np.mean(mean_scaled_value_per_day[max(0,i-20):i+1] if i >= 20 else np.nan) for i in range(len(mean_scaled_value_per_day))])\nsmoothed_mean_scaled_value_per_day.plot(title='Smoothed mean scaled feature value per day', ylabel='mean feature value', xlabel='date')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mean_scaled_value_per_day.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Confirmation in specific features\n\nAs said before, the macro-level divergence was an oversimplification, that requried to confirm the hypothesis of significant change over time observing features individually. By doing so it can be confirmed that many features' mean values change over time in dramatic ways, which suggests that market/operation trends are very dynamic and have substantially different trends over a variety of time periods. While some features show a large change from the first 80-100 days compared to later dates, it can be observed that others have relevant changes in other periods of time, e.g. 68 has a large volatility over all the training period, while feature 113 has major peaks (followed/preceded by significant drops) between days 250 and 350 (other than in the 50-150 period)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for i in range(13):\n    full_x_train[['feature_' + str(10 * i + j) for j in range(10)]].groupby(date_series).mean().rolling(window=20).mean().plot(\n        title='Rolling average of feature values over time (features {} to {})'.format(i * 10, i * 10 + 9), ylabel='Feature mean')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature-target correlation\n\nIf any feature had a reasonably high correlation with the target, it would make the classification task easier.
