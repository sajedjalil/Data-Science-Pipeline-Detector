{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About this worksheet\n\nIn the interest of making this a fantastic competition for all of us, and to give back to others who have also made their work public, I decided to create a core worksheet of my work to help everyone get started. Just knowing that this is the model that's currently on the leaderboard should give you a little confidence in it.  \n\nI still want this to be a competition, so I'm not giving away the family jewels. This is not the tuned model that is currently in second place, but it's most of it.  So don't expect to get a good score as is. But with a little tweaking and some outside-the-box thinking, it *can* get you onto the leaderboard (and maybe knock me off of it.)\n  \nI apologize in advance if my comments on these cells are below your skill level.  I definitely don't want to insult anyone's intelligence, but I decided to make things as basic as possible to help even beginners get started.  \n  \nBe sure to tip the bartender and your waiters/waitresses, and upvote any of the public worksheets/discussions that you find useful.  I've already upvoted a few that helped me, especially the one by Tarek Hamdi.  A little respect and appreciation goes a long way. \n\nAnd I want to thank Jane Street and Kaggle for making this competition available to all of us. This is a really fun event.  If you haven't been to the Jane Street website, I encourage a quick look.  It seems like a fun and worthwhile place to work.  I especially like their workplace values that they mention on the [*Join Jane Street*](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/) page.\n\nThanks, everyone, and good luck!\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load libraries and create the competition environment\nAll imports up-front for easy reference."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport cudf\n\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\n\nimport xgboost as xgb\nprint(\"XGBoost version:\", xgb.__version__)\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# create the environment\nimport janestreet\nprint('Creating competition environment...', end='')\nenv = janestreet.make_env()\nprint('Finished.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read the data  \nUses cudf to speed the process a few seconds as opposed to a straight read_csv into Pandas.
