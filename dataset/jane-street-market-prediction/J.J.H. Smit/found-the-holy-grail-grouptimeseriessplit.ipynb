This would allow for much better tuning of hyper-parameters or other aspects of the model's training process.\n\nIn this notebook I want to lay out a couple of techniques that can be used to do this. For every step we will see that there is a problem with using it for this particular competition. Fortunately the last chapter provides a solution!
