The most important piece of information that this gives us (I think) is that we are probably dealing with multiple securities / markets over here, rather than a single homogeneous index.\n\nSome other things that could be added to the feature engineering stage:\n- Add a feature that is just the number of null values in the row. Complex models might be understand the variation in training data due to null counts.\n- Add more features for the average weight and resp for that null count (beware that this is leaking some information, so may lead to some amount of overfitting. You could try adding some noise here to make it more robust).\n\nThere is one more interpretation of the null counts, which is that it tells us the time of the day (link to discussion: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/201264). I am not too sure about this, since there are many days where such a pattern is not repeated, which I think can only be explained by the fact that there are multiple markets / securites, but these are just my thoughts. \n\nThanks for going through it and please do upvote if you liked it.\nIf you want a more general understanding and analysis of the data, check out my EDA notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/yushg123/a-walk-down-jane-street-eda-baseline\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
