It can also be used to define the ANN architecture. The library I will use is *scikit-optimize*. Information on the library and parameters can be found [here](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/modules/generated/skopt.gp_minimize.html).\n\nThe libraries that need to be imported are:\n\n* from skopt import gp_minimize\n* from skopt.space import Real, Integer\n* from skopt.utils import use_named_args\n\nTo keep this short and to the point, I will not extend on how the BO works. If you would like an in depth explanation, I would suggest to read this paper from Peter Frazier (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811). In addition, the set of lectures of [Nando de Freitas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz3D36VXefI) are extremly valuable and available on Youtube. He also explains Gaussian Process in a marvellous way that blew my mind.\n\nFinally, [Jeff Heaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXdxyUCCm8s) has a great example on how to use BO to set the architecture of the ANN.\n\nOk, let's get started!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n# install datatable\n#Model\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n#Metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay\n#Optimisation\nfrom skopt import gp_minimize\nfrom skopt.space import Real, Integer\nfrom skopt.utils import use_named_args","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def basic_EDA(df):\n    size = df.shape\n    sum_duplicates = df.duplicated().sum()\n    sum_null = df.isnull().sum().sum()\n    is_NaN = df. isnull()\n    row_has_NaN = is_NaN. any(axis=1)\n    rows_with_NaN = df[row_has_NaN]\n    count_NaN_rows = rows_with_NaN.shape\n    return print(\"Number of Samples: %d,\\nNumber of Features: %d,\\nDuplicated Entries: %d,\\nNull Entries: %d,\\nNumber of Rows with Null Entries: %d %.1f%%\" %(size[0],size[1], sum_duplicates, sum_null,count_NaN_rows[0],(count_NaN_rows[0] / df.shape[0])*100))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import\n\nI will skip the EDA analysis, and we will jump straight to the data cleansing, processing and model building phase."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"According to Jane Street Group:\n* The set of features, feature_{0...129}, is anonymized and represents real stock market data.

This variable will be the search space of our optimisation algorithm (hence the name \"space\").\n\n* Since all the parameters I chosen are non-decimal values, they need to be defined with the word Integer in front, as shown below\n* If you want to optimise the learning rate, which is decimal, use Real and check the commented example in the code below\n\nFor some reason, it works best if you follow this order when setting up your code (really weird error messages when I tried to change):\n\n1. Define your search space\n1. Add **@use_named_args(space)**. This allows the GP opt. to use the params defined in your space variable\n1. Create the **objective** function\n\nSince the score I chosen is AUC, which is the higher the better, it is not ideal to be used directly in the BO optimisation function. The BO is trying to minimise the output, as such it will chose the parameter values that actually reduce the AUC if we leave it as it is. \n\nTo adapt the AUC score to a minimisation problem, I changed the objective function return output to be **1-AUC Score**.

There are more parameters to be defined, however, I find little difference when changing the acquisition function (acq_func) or the optimization method (acq_optimizer), as the default options seemed to work best for this task. \n\nIn addition, I would advise to optimise few parameters at a time.

I would not leave the default as it takes a long time for this dataset. Increase as you gain more confidence with the process. The GP optm advantage is that is converges rapidly to a good enough solution when compared to other optmisation algorithms. As such, it has been widely used for complex problems that cannot afford to be run 500x.\n1. **n_initial_points**: To define the best way forward, the GP optm will first run in some random points within the feature space.
