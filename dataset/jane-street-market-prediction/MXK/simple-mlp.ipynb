If you want to use a high number of epochs, and a lot of parameters you should have a validation dataset to watch out for overfitting.\n\n5/ hidden_units : I have increased the hidden units number, but the score went down.\n\n6/ date :  date > 85 because the data changes after around 4 months, and here we can make two models, one for the first 4 months, and another one for the rest, after that we stack them together.\n\n7/ feature_0 :  1 for buy and -1 for sell (Bid/Ask), and weight for trading volume.  \n=> Buy less, Sell more, so you increase the treshold for buy orders to 0.503 while for sell order reduce the threshold to 0.498, and we can drop this feature before training the model, and change it with other instructions in the prediction phase.\n\n### P.S.\nThose were a couple of my observations, and some of the comments that I have found usefull in the comment section on the above mentionned notebooks.\n\nPlease feel free to comment, and if You feel there is an added value of this NoteBook, consider to vote it up =)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Libs"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport cudf as cu\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom random import choices\nimport gc\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Concatenate, Lambda, GaussianNoise, Activation\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import BinaryCrossentropy\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import Normalization\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_addons as tfa","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import and Processing"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_cudf = cu.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv') #
