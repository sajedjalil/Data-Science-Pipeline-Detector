A positive expected trend would trigger the action to take the trade opportunity.

A more statistical model could also have been a good choice given the nature of the problem.\n\nThe **target** in the classification could be response > 0, however the response has a fragile relationship with the features and this relationship is constantly changing over time, so using too much information from the response could lead to overfitting easily. In order to mitigate this I used instead the mean of the responses from all the time horizons provided. This value will be less noisy as it includes shorter time horizons easier to predict.\n\nPCA and an encoder/decoder network to **denoise** and compress the original features were tested but with no significant change in the results so I decided to use the original features (scaled) straight away to avoid wasting the limited time per inference iteration. It seems that the network deals with noise and collinearity well.\n\n**Feature engineering** is not obvious with anonymized data. I end up feeding the model with a few pairs of features multiplying each other. The idea is to help the learning with significant feature interactions. To select the pairs I trained several TabNet models. Interactions with the highest coefficients in TabNet explanations were selected (6 in total). The addition of these interactions seemed to help with the score a bit in both local CV and public score.\n\n**Generalization** is always key in any prediction problem, but performance will be specially sensitive to overfitting with financial data.

The same setup has been tested with lower dropout rates (0.2) and the validation score was just slightly better, so I kept the extra regularization.\n\n\n* Blending of pairs of data points as proposed in the paper [mixup: BEYOND EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09412v2.pdf). This way the new data points fill the \"empty\" space in the training data, which helps to soft the fitting.

To bring the attention of the model to trade opportunities that will be more important in the score, data points are **weighted** in the cross-entropy loss function:\n\n```\nmin(jane street weight * abs(mean(responses from all time horizons)), 0.4)\n```\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Utility maximization model\n\nAnother completely different idea I tried was to plug the utility score function directly as loss function (multiplied by -1 to maximize).\n\nCompared to the cross-entropy function, the utility score function already weights the importance of trade opportunities based on response and Jane Street weight. To soften the influence of the response values which would introduce quite a lot of overfitting, the utility score function is modified to randomly pick the response from different time horizons. This avoids overfitting in two ways: more predictable shorter time horizons and more time variability in the response.\n\nOn top of that, noise was added to the response in proportion to its magnitude (standard deviation = response/2).\n\nSame layers, dropout rates and data blending technique used in the classification network is applied here, but in another attempt to make this model different and still reduce overfitting, the following features were used instead of the original ones:\n\n* A prediction of the general market direction of the day.\n\n\n* A prediction of the general volatility of the day.\n\n\n* Z-scores of the original features of the trade opportunity in regard to the means of the features of the previous 100 opportunities (for the same side, buy or sell).\n\n\nTo get the market trend/volatility of the day I fit linear models to the means/stds of the responses grouped by day."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf_day_trend = pickle.load(open('../input/lasso-models/clf_day_trend.pkl','rb'))\nclf_day_volat = pickle.load(open('../input/lasso-models/clf_day_volat.pkl','rb'))\n\ndf['market_trend'] = -100 * df.feature_0 * df.resp\ndays = df.groupby('date').mean()\ndays['market_volat'] = df.groupby('date')[['market_trend']].std()\n\ndays['market_trend'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(days['market_trend'].to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1))\ndays['market_volat'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(days['market_volat'].to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1))\n\nday_features = days.iloc[:,6:6+130]\n\npred_trend = StandardScaler().fit_transform(clf_day_trend.predict(day_features).reshape(-1, 1)).squeeze()\npred_volat = StandardScaler().fit_transform(clf_day_volat.predict(day_features).reshape(-1, 1)).squeeze()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(20,7))\n\nax1.set_title('daily response mean (scaled)',fontsize=14)\ndays['market_trend'].plot(ax=ax1,color=['dimgray'],alpha=.8)\npd.Series(pred_trend).plot(ax=ax1,color=['indianred'],alpha=.8)\nax1.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=False, labels=('ground truth','prediction'))\n\nax2.set_title('daily response standard deviation (scaled)',fontsize=14)\ndays['market_volat'].plot(ax=ax2,color=['dimgray'],alpha=.8)\npd.Series(pred_volat).plot(ax=ax2,color=['indianred'],alpha=.8)\nax2.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=False, labels=('ground truth','prediction'))\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=None, bottom=None, right=None, top=None, wspace=None, hspace=0.5)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"During inference, the means of the features of the last 100 trade opportunities (per side) is computed to feed to the linear models that will generate the predictions as features for the neural network.
