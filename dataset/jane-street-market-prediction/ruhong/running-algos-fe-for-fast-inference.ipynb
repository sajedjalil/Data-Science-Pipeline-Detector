So I decided to fuse both and here we are : in this notebook I give you some of the usual financial feature engineering tools and, along some standard python implementation, I try to provide you with streaming algorithms that will allow you to calculate them during inference. And it turns out that using numpy is **EXTREMELY FAST**. What is not in this notebook : some way to decide what parameter value to use (lag) or on which features to use this techniques (this might be the topic of another notebook 😉). \n\nPlease keep in mind that those implementations are my owns. So there might be some problems (well there are some problems, I even point them out), feel free to comment with a correction. \n\nIf you want to go further, you can check my other works (about [Intraday Feature Exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/lucasmorin/complete-intraday-feature-exploration),[Target Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/lucasmorin/target-engineering-patterns-denoising), and [using yfinance to download financial data in Ptyhon](https://www.kaggle.com/lucasmorin/downloading-market-data)).
