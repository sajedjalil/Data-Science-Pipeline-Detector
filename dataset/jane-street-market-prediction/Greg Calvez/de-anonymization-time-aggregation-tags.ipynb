What you need to know: \n- `tag_6` and `tag_23` are key tags that group features in 2 different groups. \n  - `tag_6` means a price feature\n  - `tag_23` means an \"additive\" feature (either a number of trades or volume trade, still not sure). \n- For a given day, grouping trades made on the same instrument is possible. One way to do this is to look at `feature_{41, 42, 43, 44, 45}`. They are constant for a day / stock combination. \n  - `41, 42, 43` are probably an embedding (PCA on returns?) of the different stocks. \n  - `44, 45` might be related to volumes?

[NaN values depending on time of day](https://www.kaggle.com/tomwarrens/nan-values-depending-on-time-of-day). Other saw that they clustered with features (i.e. some features are NaNs together) [NaN Cluster](https://www.kaggle.com/samir95/features-nan-clusters-and-pca). \n\n\nI dug into those ideas to find the meaning of the first five tags.

At the open, and around \"mid-day\". Furthermore, we can see that the \"duration\" of the NaN window depends on the group. \n\nThose results are true for all the dates. \n\n##### How can we explan this? \nFinancial markets are scheduled. Some events occur at pre-arranged times: open and close of course, but others throughout the day. Some markets have mid-day auctions, some markets even have a lunch break. \n\nIt seems that the \"open event\" and the \"lunch event\" causes an underlying metric to become NaN for a short period of time. For example if the underlying metric is a price, there is no price during auction. This NaN is then persited in our dataset features if the feature construction uses a rolling window. \n\nIf we call $f$ our feature (from the dataset) and $u$ an underlying metric, non shown in our dataset, we have the convolution with a weight $w$:\n$$ f(t) = \\sum_{s > t - \\tau} w(t-s) u(s)$$\nIf there is a NaN in $u(s)$ between $t-\\tau$ and $t$, there will be a NaN in $f(t)$. \n\nIt explains the time distribution of NaN and the features being clustered with NaN. \nThe time window of a NaN period will be the value $\\tau$. \n\n\n##### What is $w$, $\\tau$ and $u$ ? \n\n$w$ can be anything, the constant value 1 will give you plain rolling average, an exponential function will give you a exponential moving average, etc... \n$\\tau$ is the characteristic time of the rolling mechanism. \n\n$u$ is an underlying metric not shown in the dataset. It can be for example the price of the stock, or the number of trades. \n\nA feature (in our dataset) is defined by this rolling mechanism on an underlying metric. The underlying metric will be defined by other tags of the features. \n\nSee the table below for an example. The underlying (hidden) metric is defined by \"tag_23 and tag_15 and tag_26\". \nFor the sake of the example, one could imagine the meaning:  \n- \"tag_23\" -> number of trades\n- \"tag_15\" -> buyer\n- \"tag_26\" -> trade quantity > 100\n\nThen to complete the definition of the feature, you add one of the tags (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). \n\nTherefore, we would have: \n- `feature_108` is rolling sum over the last 30 min of the number of trades made by a buyer on this exchange with size larger than 100. \n- `feature_109` is rolling sum over the last 20 sec of the number of trades made by a buyer on this exchange with size larger than 100. \n- etc\n\nOf course, those values are then re-normalized.
