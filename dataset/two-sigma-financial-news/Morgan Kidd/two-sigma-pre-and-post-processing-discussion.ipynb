I believe that the modeling aspects of this challenge have been exhaustively documented by other users, but any model (especially a trading model) requires adequate data preperation and postprocessing to perform well. I will first go over some data selection issues, including a brief discussion on sample selection and train/validation splitting. I will then train a model and introduce some analytics to better examine how and why the model performs in a certain way. Finally, I will discuss some alternate validation methods that may be used to identify model false positives.\n\nMuch of the code in the first half of this kernel was adapted from other users' contributions on Kaggle.

Instead, I'll look at justifying a few filters. Firstly, I elect to remove the top/bottom 0.01% of samples based on the `returnsOpenNextMktres10` and `returnsOpenPrevMktres10` features, just to filter significant outliers that are likely data entry errors. This is justified as the `returns` features are all in percentage terms, and removing outliers along this axis reduces the standard deviation of most of the returns series to values in the <10% range. See the descriptive output above.\n\nNext, a relevant question is whether we should limit the data universe to just the investable universe or not. In theory, it would be best to only use the same sample of securities in training data as will be used for actual prediction. However, over 40% of the sample would be excluded in this case, which could affect the accuracy of our model.\n\nIt is reasonable to expect most of the return features to have roughly similar distributions both in and out of the investable universe, as most of these features are related to returns and will be roughly symmetrical with mean = 0. The crucial piece of difference, though, is that volume for the investable universe is nearly an order of magnitutde larger on average than the volume outside of the universe. This is because the assets in the investible universe are only larger-cap US equities. Differences in volume may have a significant impact on the sensitivity of the securities to news articles, and could make the model less robust. As a result, I believe it is prudent to use only the data in the investable universe, even though this may make the model less accurate in training and validation.

In my opinion, I think this creates a sufficient case to consider leaving the securities outside our investing universe out of the model, but overall there probably will not be a significant difference with or without that part of the sample.\n\nMoving on the data merging, we can now combine the the news dataframe with the market dataframe. I also create a few new features here, including the intraday return `bartrend`, the intraday average, and price-volume (total number of dollars exchanged, note it is unclear to me if volume is already stated in this way or if the feature is just based on securities exchanged). \n\nAdditionally, I choose to exclude data from before 2012 for qualitative reasons. It seems likely that the 2008-9 crisis and subsequent recovery may cause the sample to behave qualitatively different. \n\nNews features are also added, including `position` which gives a number representing how early in the article the subject company is mentioned, and `coverage`, which measures the proportion of sentiment words relative to the size of the article.\n\nI previously experimented with using other conditional features, e.g. importance conditional on the news being positive, but found that decision tree models were generally unimpacted.\n\nFinally, several news features are excluded as previous tests have found very low feature importance.

Obviously for this competition additional data collection is not a possibility, and I will continue using news sentiment features out of spirit of the competition. I must stress here that many of the top kernels in this competition mentioned that they only used price history data for their features. This is not egregious from a data science perspective, but using only price history does lack theoretical foundation, see Fama (1970) \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Put simply, price history is easily collectible public data, and any advantage found using price history should theoretically be obtainable by many other traders as well, which is likely to eliminate any profitable opportunities.

In this final section, I will look at using a more robust cross validation method to ensure the stability of the model. Combinatorial Purged Cross Validation (CPCV) uses N partitions of the dataset in to combinations with K partitions retained for validation. Due to the combinatorial approach, the validation sets can then be used to reconstruct more than one backtesting path. The advantage of this is that we can repeatedly test a model on the same data without incurring any sort of look ahead bias, which may reduce false positives. The model also features data purging to prevent data leaking due to the lag features.\n\nThe implementation is worked out based on De Prado's *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (2018). This particular function isn't totally tested, though, so I elected to just use the last 500,000 samples in the dataset to avoid any crashing.

It is difficult to produce news sentiment data, and the applications to the stock market are quite clear.\n\nIn practice, there was essentially a 0% correlation between the news sentiment features and the market price history features, feature importance corroborated that features based on news sentiment were essentially useless, and many of the top scorers report that they did not use the news sentiment data at all. So instead, we essentially have a pool of people competing to find a strategy that goes against the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis.\n\nNearly 3000 individuals or teams made submissions in this competition, if everyone submitted strategies at random then we'd still see around 150 of them outperforming at a statistically significant (5%) level, regardless of how robust to overfitting LightGBM may be. What's worse, is that the top 10 participants alone made over 500 submissions, and then picked presumably their best submission for final assessment.\n\nThankfully, this is just a competition and not legitimate academic research, but it still (in my opinion) reflects an epistemology problem in the field - overemphasis on accuracy and validation scores at all costs, and ignoring methodology to reduce false positives.\n\nI hope that my discussion of using CPCV, and examination of the model performance may inspire more rigorous investigation in to the source and stability of the performance of the features in others' models. I think areas of future research are additional feature engineering and testing the robustness of these features, as well as looking in to meta-labeling methods that may produce better bet sizing."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3fa3fd46278cfc20ab514db8995fa3905b8e2af4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
