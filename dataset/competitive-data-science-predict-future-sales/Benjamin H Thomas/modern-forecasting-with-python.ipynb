The indirect correlations are a linear function of the correlation of the observation with observations at intervening time steps.\n\nIt is these indirect correlations that the PACF seeks to remove. The correlation between point Y0 and Y1 will have seome inertia and affect points later on.\n\nIn short, the PACF kind of conveys the pure correlation between an observation and the series. That way you will know if the obsevation is needed in the AR term or not.\n\n**How do we find p?:** Any autocorrelation in a stationary time series can be fixed by adding enough AR terms. So we initially take the order of the AR term to be equal to the number of lags that cross the significance limit in the PACF plot.\n\nTime series analysis is a bit of an art, there isn't a set methodlogy that you have to follow, many people analyse the ACF and PACF plots to find certain patterns that may give away the right order, but it is also possible to systematically find the correct order, although it is rather computationally intensive.
