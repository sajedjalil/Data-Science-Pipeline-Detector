The features include examples of each of the main types of statistical data:\n\n<h4>Numerical:</h4>\n\n * <span style=\"color:darkblue\">Discrete</span> - countable features that take only integer values, such as <code>month_length</code> or  <code>months_since_last_sale</code>\n * <span style=\"color:darkblue\">Continuous</span> - measurable features that take a range of values and are measured / calculated rather than counted, for example <code>lag_1m_mean_sales</code> or <code>lag_3m_mean_cat_revenue</code>\n\n<h4>Categorical:</h4>\n\n * <span style=\"color:darkblue\">Nominal</span> - features that can't be represented numerically, other than to give them an arbitrary ID that has no numerical meaning. Examples are (pretty obviously anything suffixed with id) <code>item_id</code> or  <code>item_category_id</code>\n * <span style=\"color:darkblue\">Ordinal</span> - discrete features that can be ordered, but are still categorical or can't be explained by counting only. A simple example would be education level (primary / secondary / university). Whilst debatable, it can be argued that <code>month</code> is an ordinal feature (particularly as it's distinguished from <code>date_block_num</code>). In this setting (retail sales), the different months have a significance beyond their numerical position in the year (given the holidays they contain for example), and so can't be explained by just counting them up and numbering them.\n \n<h2>MLP Challenges</h2>\n\nThe categorical features in the dataset present a problem for a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Each node or \"perceptron\" in an MLP is activated based on the linear combination of the node's inputs multiplied by the (trainable) weights corresponding to each input, very similar in spirit to linear regression:\n\n<br>\n\n![IMG-20191206-163546.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T1DNBfb1/IMG-20191206-163546.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\nThis presents two obvious problems where categorical data is concerned:\n1. The model is simply unable to handle non-numerical input. So all categorical data must be converted into numerical data.\n2. The categorical data should be **interpretable** by the model as numerical data.\n\nAs such, it's not good enough simply to convert your categories into an ordinal variable (i.e. an ID) and feed that into the MLP. The structure will assume a numeric relationship between all the inputs, and so **id 4** would be assumed to have a magnitude that is twice that of **id 2** which is, of course, nonsense.\n\n<h2>The Traditional Solution</h2>\n\nThe traditional work-around for this issue is to use <bold>One Hot Encoding</bold>. This simply involves creating a new feature for each different category within your categorical feature, and assigning the new features the values 1 if they match the category and 0 if they don't. For example, from the following data:\n\n<br>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>name:</th>\n    <th>animal</th>\n    <th>age</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Fido</td>\n    <td>Dog</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Spanky</td>\n    <td>Cat</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Nibbles</td>\n    <td>Rabbit</td>\n    <td>2.5</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jaws</td>\n    <td>Dog</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n\n<text>.... the animal category could be converted via One Hot Encoding to:</text>\n\n<br>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>name:</th>\n    <th>age</th>\n    <th>Dog</th>\n    <th>Cat</th>\n    <th>Rabbit</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Fido</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Spanky</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Nibbles</td>\n    <td>2.5</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jaws</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n\nSimple! This approach does come with a couple of key drawbacks however:\n\n1. When presented with a feature with several elements / several categorical features / both, it doesn't take long for your dataset to reach unmanageably large dimensions\n2. Often categorical features are interrelated. One Hot Encoding treats all categories as independent of one another. Take for example the days of the week - Monday-Friday and Saturday/Sunday have particular shared relationships not captured by simply encoding them in separate features\n\nThe dimensionality issue is particularly stark in this case, as our dataset is already ~2.5M examples by 25+ features, 5 of which are purely categorical. Within these 5 categorical features are tens of thousands of individual distinct elements, and so it's simply not feasible to consider One Hot Encoding in this case (without dropping some of the categorical features outright).\n\nThankfully, there is a solution that addresses all of these issues:\n\n<h2>Embedding Categorical Features</h2>\n\nIf you've read anything about natural language processing, you will certainly have encountered the concept of embeddings before. An embedding is an encoding of the properties of categorical information in a fixed-length numerical form. This is particularly useful in natural language processing as the meaning and semantics of a word or sentence can be represented numerically in a fixed-length vector.\n\nAn example could be an embedding of the words **King, Prince, Queen, Princess** as follows:\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><code>King = [-1,1]</code></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><code>Prince = [-1,-1]</code></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><code>Queen = [1,1]</code></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><code>Princess = [1,-1]</code></div>\n\n<br>\n\nIn this example, the first dimension encodes the **masculinity / femininity** of the word, and the second dimension the age attribute **young / old**. Of course, in reality much longer vectors are used and in such a way that it's not so easy to distinguish definite features.\n\nThis concept can be leveraged to interpret categorical data to be fed to an MLP. Embedding layers can be added for any categorical features in the dataset, which convert the data into a vector that is fed into the MLP input layer. The embedding layer itself is trainable as part of the neural network, and so learns the 'meaning' of the different categorical data as it trains.\n\n<h2>Embedding Layer</h2>\n\nAn embedding layer is pretty simple. It can be thought of as a lookup table of weights that has the same number of rows as your output embedding vector, and the same number of columns as there are categories in your categorical feature. For example, if you had 10 different elements in your categorical feature, you could visualise your embedding layer like so:\n\n<br>\n\n![IMG-20191206-163111.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/wMFbc7cK/IMG-20191206-163111.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\nThis embedding layer would convert each sample in your categorical feature into a vector of length 5. As it trains, your network will then update the weights in the table to best \"describe\" each element of your categorical feature.\n\n<h2>Adding Embedding Layers to an MLP</h2>\n\nEmbedding layers like the above can be added for each of the categorical features in your dataset. The values from the vector outputs of these embeddings can then be fed into a basic MLP alongside the numeric data in your dataset, which is fed straight into the MLP unchanged:\n\n<br>\n\n![IMG-20191206-164746.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NfbRYZxj/IMG-20191206-164746.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\nThe whole network is then trained in forward / backward passes that begin and end at the embedding layers. By training the embedding layers, the network can learn the best embedding that represents the different features of the categorical variables.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic Keras Example\n\nNow let's get down to some business.

A bit of work is needed to create a dataset that the embedding model will be happy with.\n\n<h2>Data Preparation</h2>\n\nFirstly, the categorical features will need to be identified and given ordinal encodings for each individual element in each category (i.e. encoding each element with a number from 0 to the total number of elements):"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\n\ncat_features = ['date_block_num', 'item_id', 'shop_id', 'item_category_id', 'months_since_item_first_sale',\n                'months_since_last_sale', 'month', 'month_length']\n\ntrain_test_cat_features = pd.concat([train_data[cat_features], test_data[cat_features]])\n\nenc = OrdinalEncoder().fit(train_test_cat_features)\n\ntrain_data_cat_features = pd.DataFrame(enc.transform(train_data[cat_features]),\n                                       columns=cat_features)\ntest_data_cat_features = pd.DataFrame(enc.transform(test_data[cat_features]),\n                                      columns=cat_features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"An important point to note: some of the features chosen might be thought of as traditional discrete numerical data, such as <code>months_since_item_first_sale</code>. Whilst this may be so, often values within these discrete features are not entirely independent of one another and can include some element of covariability, as more traditional categorical features might.\n\nAn example might be a particular period after an item is first sold, when items are typically reduced as a promotion - the months preceding / after the promotion period will be more closely associated with one another. By embedding these features, we can capture these additional associations if there are any (as they will then be represented by a vector of continuous values rather than an individual discrete value), at no loss (other than additional complexity) if they are indeed completely independent.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, any discrete feature that has a relatively small range of values may well benefit from encoding, and so it's worth treating all such features as categorical in this setting.\n\nAll categorical features will then need to be fed into the model separately. The model accepts a list of inputs: an individual integer for each categorical feature, and a vector of the remaining numerical data.

As such, don't expect mind-blowing predictions in its current state. I would encourage anyone interested to fork this notebook, upload your own prepared dataset and have a play around. As is always the case with neural networks, there are a huge number of possible architectures and parameters to play around with. Possible interesting avenues include:\n\n* adding / removing / widening / shortening  layers in the network\n* adjusting the regularization layers / parameters (dropout / l2)\n* adding new regularization parameters\n* changing activation functions\n* changing the gradient descent optimizer\n* adjusting the learning rate and no of epochs\n* etc, etc.....\n\nWith some tinkering, you'll find that the networks performance can quickly approach that of the aforementioned popular models. Neural networks like this also offer a huge amount of flexibility which can offer some really promising avenues for improving your scores. \n\n<b>Note: you can dramatically improve the training time of the model by increasing the batch size and utilizing a GPU session!</b>"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nitem_categories = pd.read_csv(\"../input/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/item_categories.csv\")\nitems = pd.read_csv(\"../input/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/items.csv\")\nshops = pd.read_csv(\"../input/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/shops.csv\")","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
