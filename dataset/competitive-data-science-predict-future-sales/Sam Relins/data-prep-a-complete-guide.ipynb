So, for example, an <code><b>int64</b></code> is an integer value with 64 bits of memory reserved for its storage.

We won't be fitting a model here, as this has already been a pretty epic journey! At any rate, It's recommended to prep your data and fit your model separately for this competition. For one thing, Jupyter notebooks (on which Kaggle notebooks are based) and pandas both have some quirks when it comes to memory that mean a large amount of RAM is eaten up as you prep data that is neither required, nor is it easy to free up. It's much easier and quicker to pickle your train and test datasets and then load a fresh notebook to build and test models so you don't run into memory issues. This has the added benefit of keeping your data prep and model stages separate, so they can be versioned much more clearly when you commit, and you can organise several separate models should you wish to ensemble at some point. \n\nThis competition really is about the data. Better data cleaning and feature engineering can improve scores dramatically - comparatively, model selection and parameter tuning are far less important. The training data prepared in this model, with a few decent lagged features added (that aren't provided above - that would be too easy!) will provide competitors with data that can easily score in the very low <b>0.9 RMSE</b> area when fed to any of your bog-standard XGBoost / LightGBM / RandomForestRegressor models, more or less out of the box.\n\nTo summarise, we have:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Cleaned the data - eliminating outliers and repeat data items etc.</li>\n    <li>Looked more closely at the categorical features to engineer some useful sub-categories</li>\n    <li>Grouped the sales data so it represents monthly transactions</li>\n    <li>Added zero transactions for items and shops that feature in a month, but represent no transactions in combination</li>\n    <li>Managed memory footprint very carefully and downcast features where possible</li>\n    <li>Created a feature that tells us how long it is since items first / last sold</li>\n    <li>Created lag features to point your model to past sales performance in different categories</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nAll that remains is a warning from the author. As mentioned above, the temporal element of this particular data presents a number of challenges, none more so than when it comes to model evaluation. All of the usual train validation methods, your CV splits and your K-folds, are not welcome here. Using a random sample of the training data from the whole timeline to evaluate a model will really encourage it to dig deep, and remember the performance of each item in each month to make the best predictions on the validation data. When it comes to the test data however, it wont ever have seen data from month 34, and so all this memorising will have been for nought. Put more simply and scientifically, a model will massively overfit if we validate this way. \n\nInsted we should set up your train / validation split to a group of the earlier months for training and then the month immediately following for the validation. This will ensure that our model is optimised to make predictions on data it hasn't seen before, and that it can't cheat by using data from the same month it's being tested on. Doing this, we should also be mindful that our train / validation / test distributions will differ and so we may well end up with quite substantial differences in RMSE scoring. As such, validating the model several times using different ultimate months is encouraged i.e. 'walking forward' using month 30, then 31, then 32, and so on as validation data, and the prior 12 months to train.\n\nWith that, I bid you farewell. Sincere thanks to those that made it to the end - I would really welcome any feedback or comments. Anybody interested in the next stage, model fitting, may wish to take a look at the following:\n\n<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/dustyturner/dense-nn-with-categorical-embeddings'>Dense NN With Categorical Embeddings</a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Appendix - adding zero transactions"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The most significant breakthroughs I experienced in this competition have come from different approaches when adding entries for items that haven't sold. \n\nWe should start by asking <b>if</b> it's even necessary to add zero transactions. We can quickly answer this question by making a submission in which we predict <b>1.0</b> for every entry, and another where we predict <b>0.5</b>. You will find the score for the <b>0.5</b> predictions is considerably higher, leading us to believe that either some of the targets should be zero, or that the competition organisers have lied to us and some of the targets are fractions. Lets assume the former! Therefore, we can assume we'll need to feed our model some zeros, or it's not going to do a good job of making predictions itself. \n\nWith the <b>if</b> answered we can move onto the <b>how</b>. We are making some big assumptions when we choose any approach that adds examples to our training data. When we add zero transactions we are effectively telling our model <b>\"this item was on the shelves in this shop, and nobody picked it up and bought it\"</b>.  With this we can make a huge difference to the effectiveness of our model, positive or negative:\n\nInitially, I began by adding a zero entry for every month / shop / item in the training data that didn't already feature. That's a lot of entries,  ~ 41.5M to be exact! This was just unmanageably large even without engineering any further features. To overcome this, I removed any of the items that don't feature in the test set and went about engineering new features from there. The model predictions from this data were always overly cautious - very few predictions rose above the 0.4-0.6 range. The resulting RMSEs weren't fantastic (around the 1.0 mark). \n\nIt is clear from the above results, that far too many zero-sales transactions had been added. Indeed, after some more exploration of the data I found that certain shops and the majority of items don't make their initial appearance in <code><b>date_block_num</b></code> zero and often appear for the first time much later. By removing any zero transactions for shops or items that have yet to feature in the <code><b>sales_train</b></code> in a given month, the results improved dramatically - dropping to a RMSE of approximately 0.92 in the best case. Whilst this was a much better result, it wasn't particularly close to the top end of the leaderboard which was pretty frustrating.\n\nI stagnated at the previous 'stage' of my results for a long time. The final breakthrough came in two stages. Firstly I noted that the majority of my predictions were still very tentative - that is to say, closer to 0-1 than above, and that my best results were achieved when my models tended to make more 'daring' predictions above 1. I then went back to the data, looking at the pattern of sales for different items. Several items exhibit gaps in their sales patterns: some miss the odd month here or there, others don't feature for several months at a time and then reappear. Several of the items drop off entirely and then make a sudden and significant resurgence (if you'd like to see this for yourself, have a play around with the graph of item sales in the exploration section above, as it is a similar graph that helped me make this discovery). \n\nIt became clear to me that my assumption <b>\"once an item featured in the data it was on sale from then on in every shop\"</b> may have been a problem. Items may have been removed from shelves, meaning they had no opportunity to sell,  before being added again. Alternatively, there may have been gaps in the training data and I was superimposing zero sales of items that did in fact sell. At any rate, by removing any zero examples that didn't feature at all in a given month of <code><b>sales_train</b></code>, i.e. either the shop or item were totally absent, removed a huge number of zero transactions. This allowed me to re-introduce the dropped examples, those that didn't feature in the test data, back into the training data. The result was an immediate improvement in my score, and this approach has continued to produce my best scores (just over 0.90 at the time of writing)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
