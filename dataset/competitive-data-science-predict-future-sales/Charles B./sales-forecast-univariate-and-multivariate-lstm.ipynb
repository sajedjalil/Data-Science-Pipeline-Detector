A reason that could explain the general decrease is the fact that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month as written in the \"Data\" section of this kaggle project.

At first look, that's counter intuitive but it is actually normal in this case when we think about it. Our LSTM architecture includes 2 dropout layers that are used during training loop but are NOT in validation loop (Keras default behavior). Regularization methods often sacrifice training accuracy to improve validation/testing accuracy. This fact can explain by itself why it gives more accurate predictions on validation data and so a lower loss. Another reason is that training loss is measured during each epoch while validation loss is measured after each epoch. Training loss is continually reported over the course of an entire epoch, however, validation metrics are computed over the validation set only once the current training epoch is completed.
