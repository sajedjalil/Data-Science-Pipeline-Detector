{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Understanding the shops in the test file and in sales data\n\nI wanted to get a grip on which of the shops we have to produce predictions for (i.e. those in the `test.csv` file) appear in the sales data and to get some grasp on the presence of relevant sales data for these shops. In real life shops may open or close and some shops may sell more items than others. To get this understanding I developed the following chart (should be inline below) and this notebook describes how it was built.\n\n![image.png](foo.png)\n\nThere are a number of components to this chart:\n\n* At the top is a list of the `shop_id`s that appear in the `sales_train.csv` data (57 in total - see notes on cleaning later in notebook)\n\n* At the bottom is the list of the `shop_id`s that appear in the `test.csv` file (42 in total)\n\n* The `shop_id`s are ordered according to the total item sales for that shop for the last month in the sales data (Oct 2015) with the shop with the most sales on the left.\n\n* The bars in the lower half of the chart indicate the volume of sales by shop in that last month relative to the left-most shop.\n    - _These bars are coloured blue if the shop is associated with a city or green if an online store (see later)_\n    \n    \n* The top half of the chart includes indicators showing the presence or absence of sales data over different time intervals for each shop:\n\n    - _The top (dark red) bar indicates that there was at least one sale prior to October 2014 (1 year prior to end of sales data)_\n    - _The next (red) bar indicates there were sales between October 2014 and May 2015_\n    - _The yellow bar indicates the presence of sales for that shop in the last 6 months (i.e. between May 2015 and October 2015)_\n    - _The green bar indicates that shop has recorded sales in the last month._\n    - _Note: the height of these bars is fixed, it doesn't try to show us anything about the volume of sales in these periods_\n   \nThere has been some clean up of the data in producing this chart which is discussed in the section on constructing the chart below.","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Insights taken from the chart\n\n* The shops in the test data have all had sales in the month prior to the month we have to make predictions for. \n\n* Shops without sales in the last month do not appear in the test set. It looks like 13 stores have closed.\n\n* The exception to this is `shop_id = 9` and `shop_id = 20` which had data in the last month but do not appear in the test set. In each of these cases there seems to be missing data between 1 year and 6 months ago. We could speculate that this is the reason they are not included and think about whether to include them in any training examples. The shop meta data for `shop_id = 9` described this is shop as 'Outbound Trade' which may indicate it is unusual, but `shop_id=20` seems like a store in Moscow.  \n\n* One shop (`shop_id=36`) looks relatively new with sales data only in last 6 months.\n\n* Two of the shop names could not be matched to a city. `shop_id = 12` and `shop_id = 55` are described as `Emergency Shop Online` and `Digital warehouse 1C-Online` respectively. Whilst at the higher end of the sales ranking the total volume of sales from these shops in the last month doesn't seem unusual compared to stores whos name contain a city, which I assume are physical stores.\n\n* A couple of the shops `shop_id = 25` and `shop_id = 31` seem to sell significantly more than other stores.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Building the chart\n\nThe chart is made using matplotlib `axvline` to draw the bars."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nimport itertools\nfrom pathlib import Path \ncompetition_data = Path('../input/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales')\nadditional_data = Path('../input/russian-cities-population-wikipedia')\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load in the shops in sales and test"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The shops and items in the test set for which we must make predictions\nshops_in_test=pd.read_csv(competition_data/'test.csv',usecols=['shop_id']).shop_id.unique()\n\n# The sales data\ndaily_sales=pd.read_csv(competition_data/'sales_train.csv',usecols=['shop_id','date_block_num','item_cnt_day'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Version 1: Which of these shops are in the sales data?\n\nThe first version of the chart orders the shops by their `shop_id` and shows the presence or absence of data in sales and test sets.
