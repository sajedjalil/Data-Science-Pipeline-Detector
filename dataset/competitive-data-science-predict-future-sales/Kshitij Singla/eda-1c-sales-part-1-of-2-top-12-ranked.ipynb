Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.<br>\n> <b>test.csv - </b>the test set. We need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.<br>\n> <b>items.csv - </b>supplemental information about the items/products (item names)<br>\n> <b>item_categories.csv - </b>supplemental information about the items categories (item category names)<br>\n> <b>shops.csv - </b>supplemental information about the shops (shop names)<br>\n\n<b>Key Data Challenges - </b>Aside from the common issues of outliers and missing data (as we will see, the data quality provided here is actually very good, so we don't have to worry about these issues very much), there are 3 unique (or maybe not actually) data challenges-;\n\n> <b>Russian Data - </b>Nearly all of the data is in Russian text, however we as data explorer junkies are not to be deterred by this! Here I will show how we can easily translate all of the text to English and the amazing insights this will lead us to, just as all the breathtaking stories only data hows to tell.<br>\n> <b>Large Data - </b>The sales_train dataframe comprises of 3 million rows, which obfuscates signal detection to some extent but also obviously provides us with a tremendous opportunity to get more data insights and to pull our big guns out and brag with our more complex data forecasting processes. However for achieving this, we must endeavour to trim the noise from the data as far as possible.<br>\n> <b>Mix of shops and items Data (with some Test data items unseen in Train) - </b>We are presented with transactions of various items and various shops in our train data set. Our model must be versatile enough so that it can build a wholesome model that can find ways to consistently predict despite these variations. Moreover it must be able to predict sales for items for which we have no data in our train set too!\n><center><h1>Motivation </h1></center>\n\n> I very recently embarked on this exciting data science expedition and ever since I have wondered why did I not delve into this intricate world before. This kernel (as part of a 2 kernels series) is intended to showcase (and more importantly to brag - I am <b>currently placed 12/11789 place (top 0.1%) with 0.821 RMSE score</b>) how much I enjoyed working on this data challenge and the unbelievably massive learning I had (will talk more about my learnings in the 2nd kernel); but it is also my hope that I can reveal some really exciting and breathtaking insights about this seemingly run-of-the-mill sales data, so that the reader is engaged and exhilarated enough to want to venture on working on this data themselves too and join in on the data adventures here!<br><br>\n> As is custom, I began working with EDA, in order to invoke ideas for feature engineering, which as we know, is one of the most (if not THE most) significant processes for achieving good forecasting accuracy - here I have presented a snapshot of some of the most beautiful data visualizations which led me to some very unique feature engineering ideas and the final forecasting score that I achieved. Wondrously, this dataset offered the opportunity to leverage a huge variety of feature engineering tools- I have displayed here the many features I developed- <b>geolocation, text vectorization,log transformations,discretization of continuos features and target mean encodings of categorical features</b>.<br>\n><center><h1>Acknowledgements </h1></center>\n\n>I would like to thank the author of the following kernel from whom I learned so much, you must visit it as well-;\n> - https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/1st-place-solution-part-1-hands-on-data\n\n>Without further ado, let us dive into the data analysis as promised!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install translate\n!pip install folium\n!pip install geopy\n!pip install yellowbrick\n!pip install google_trans_new","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-05T08:48:50.99582Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-05T08:48:50.996335Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-05T08:49:24.462055Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-05T08:48:50.996287Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-05T08:49:24.460802Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"3\">\n<center><h1>Importing Libraries..","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom google_trans_new import google_translator\n\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\nimport folium\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom yellowbrick.text import FreqDistVisualizer\nfrom yellowbrick.text import TSNEVisualizer\nfrom matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction import text \nfrom operator import itemgetter","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-05T08:50:13.088578Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-05T08:50:13.088986Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-05T08:50:35.92043Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-05T08:50:13.088944Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-05T08:50:35.919177Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sales=pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/sales_train.csv\")\nindex_cols = ['shop_id', 'item_id', 'date_block_num']\n\nsales.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-05T08:50:50.812111Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-05T08:50:50.81248Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-05T08:50:53.161792Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-05T08:50:50.812444Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-05T08:50:53.160697Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"3\">\n\n>This is the primary dataframe we will work with, as aforementioned the item,item category and shop names can all be derived from the other supplemental dataframes, and we will get to that soon enough...Let us first examine the distributions of the two numeric features given to us, the item price and item count day (target).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sales['item_cnt_day'].describe()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-05T08:50:55.998068Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-05T08:50:55.998411Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-05T08:50:56.086076Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-05T08:50:55.998381Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-05T08:50:56.085054Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"3\">\n\n>First observation to make here is that there are negative entries for our target variable here as well, and this is because this represents the items returned.

It means that there is a very strong chance those 6972 items in test set (across all shops) are likely to have zero sales for our test month (November), we can simply mark them as 0.0 for our predictions without even running any models! I cross validated the use of this logic for prior months, the most shocking fact I found is even the best models I could train did not make the zero predictions, which when I manually changed to zero, improved my cross validation error significantly. This just goes to show how important preprocessing,visualization,EDA and in general human intuition is, given that it can beat even the most complex models in existence (at least so far it can).\n>\n>And I think that is a very fitting note to end the 1st part of my kernels in, it's truly been extremely fun and joyous putting this together, and I have learned so much while attempting to articulately express my thought process with my work on this competition.
