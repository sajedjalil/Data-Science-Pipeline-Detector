By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills. You are provided with daily historical sales data.\n\nThe task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.\n\nEvaluation: Submissions are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE). True target values are clipped into [0,20] range.\n\n\nYou are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set.

The assumption of the previous value benchmark approach is that the number of items sold at a particular shop doesn't vary too much from month-to-month. As a result, we can just straight up submit the monthy sales for October 2015 as a proxy for November 2015 (the test set period).\n\n### Project Tip #2 (From Coursera):\nA good exercise is to reproduce previous_value_benchmark. As the name suggest - in this benchmark for the each shop/item pair our predictions are just monthly sales from the previous month, i.e. October 2015.\n\nThe most important step at reproducing this score is correctly aggregating daily data and constructing monthly sales data frame. You need to get lagged values, fill NaNs with zeros and clip the values into [0,20] range. If you do it correctly, you'll get precisely 1.16777 on the public leaderboard.\n\nGenerating features like this is a necessary basis for more complex models.
