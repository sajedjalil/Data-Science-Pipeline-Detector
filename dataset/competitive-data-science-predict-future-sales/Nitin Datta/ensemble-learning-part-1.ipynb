Now I offer you two plumbers, each with 4 stars rating, that charge 75 dollars apiece. My selling point to you is that they would visit one at a time, and the second plumber will fix whatever the first didn’t do right. You laugh at me and take a rock-star plumber. Why would you spend 2x the time and 1.5x the money when the first plumber would probably do the job just fine?\n\nLet’s start with the same premise, but now I offer you 4 plumbers. Each has a 3 star rating, so they charge 23 dollars apiece. They would come to your house together, work as a team, and fix your problem faster and for less money. You think about it for a second, because it would be nice to save 8 dollars. In the end, you decide to go with your rock-star plumber because: a) he must be good if he is charging 100 dollars; b) other 4 plumbers can’t be as good or else they would be charging more. Even though you are probably right on both counts, that still doesn’t guarantee you made the best choice.\n\nIn most societies there is an unwritten rule that a single expert is always better than 3 so-so experts combined. But let’s see if that holds for predictions we have to make.\n\nBelow is a simple example of predicting 10 digits that are evenly split between 1 and 0.\n\n```\n1111100000    Ground truth \n1110100000    Strong learner (90%) Best at predicting 0s\n```\n\nIt seems like we have a very good model – a good expert, if you will. This model is perfect in predicting 0s, and pretty good at predicting 1s.\n\nNow we take three weak models, none of which are better than 70% in predicting digits.\n\n```\n1111100000     Ground truth\n1011110100     Weak learner (70%) Good at predicting 1s\n1101000010     Weak learner (70%) Good at predicting 0s\n0110101001     Weak learner (60%) Not good at predicting anything\n1111100000     Vote average of weak learners (100%)\n```\n\nWe take the average vote of their predictions since none of them are very good. Amazingly, we get a prediction at 100% accuracy. Is this a setup devised by yours truly in number selection, or does it actually hold in real life?\n\nIt is fairly intuitive that blending two good models will again yield a good model, and it also makes sense that the result could be better than either individual model. It is not so obvious that blending a good and a bad model could yield a better result. It is even less obvious that blending 3 bad models could yield a really good model, but that is the case.\n\nThis phenomenon is often referred to as the strength of weak learners. **This doesn’t mean that combining any 3 weak learners will result in a great model**. A complementary expertise is needed. If you get 3 individuals with mediocre expertise that overlaps 95% between them, that would mean that each brings in only 5% unique knowledge compared to their union. On the other hand, 3 WEAK AND DIVERSE experts that overlap 70% in their knowledge and bring 30% of unique expertise each, are likely to blend into a good model. That is exactly the case with 3 weak learners I used in the example above: one of them is equally good/bad at predicting everything, while the other two are good at predicting 1s and 0s, respectively."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The above story/information is picked from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/51058#290767)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n\n1.
