It includes\n- dataset cleaning and monthly aggregation\n- exploratory data analysis\n- feature engineering (extraction of supercategories from the category names, features to account for time since release of an item, time since first/last sale in shop, typical values and statistics on the prices,...)\n- target encoding, then temporal lagging and temporal averaging (or min/max) over past months\n- splitting of dataset into three classes of realisations (month,shop,item): item new in the dataset this month / item not new but never sold in this shop before / item sold in this shop in the past\n- validation and fitting of xgbregressor for each of the three classes of realisations defined above, with different features and hyperparameters"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"DESCRIPTION OF THE APPROACH\n\nWe aim at predicting the quantities sold for each sample (shop, item) on the next month. For each item, the quantities sold vary through time (from month to month) and space (from shop to shop). Besides, similarity between items is embedded in the category they belong to.\n\n- Additional features are extracted from the item categories to enhance the understanding of item similarity. In particular, supercategories are defined that encompass several categories of items of the same type (such as consoles, video games, accessories, books, music, ...).\n\n- The spatial variability of the sales appear to be mostly orthogonal to the temporal variations (similar temporal variations across all shops). Spatial trends are accounted for through target encoding of the shops.\n\n- This solution is mostly based on the temporal separation of the samples (shop, item) depending on so-called 'seniority' levels. Each month, we analyse separately samples made of items that are new in the dataset this month (seniority = 0), samples (shop, item) made of items that are not new but have never been sold in this specific shop before (seniority = 1), and samples (shop, item) made of items that have already been sold in the past in this very shop (seniority = 2).\n\nThe main idea behind this separation is that the dataset on a given month is made of the cartesian product between the whole global catalogue of items and the whole set of shops open, whereas in practice the local catalogue of items available in a given shop only includes a fraction of the global catalogue. Being able to discriminate items that are in fact available in a given shop from items that are actually not should ease the predictions, as samples (shop, item) with items not even available in the shop in question cannot possibly be sold there in the future. \n\nSamples (shop, item) of seniority 2 are made of items that have previously been sold in this very shop, and so they are in the local catalogue of this shop for sure. For such samples, our predictions will be mostly based on the quantities sold for this item in this shop in the past.\n\nSamples (shop, item) of seniority 1 are made of items that have never been sold in this shop, but have been sold in other shops before. Such a sample (shop, item) is likely to be made of an item that is not actually available in this shop, and the likelihood that this item will be sold in this shop in the future is very low. In fact, data analysis proves that only 5% of these samples contribute to the sales (compared to 20-25% of samples of seniority 2. Those few samples of seniority 1 that will be sold are likely made of items that are always sold in low quantities, possibly less than one per month. Here again, data analysis shows that the average sales for items of seniority 1 is around 0.05 (against 0.4 in seniority 2) and the likelihood that an item of seniority 1 is sold in quantities superior to 3 is less than 0.1%. Samples of seniority 1 yielding sale quantities above 8 are so rare that they may be considered noise. For seniority 1, the critical features are the number of months since it has been released in the catalogue without being sold in this shop, and the typical sale quantities of this item in shops where it has been sold in the past. If an item is typically sold in large quantities but have never been sold in a given shop, it is unlikely that it will suddenly start being sold next month. Similarly, if the item has never been sold in a given shop in spite having been released for many months in the catalogue, it is likely that it will never be sold in this shop, or only in very small quantities. Conversely, if the item has only been released last month, it is possible that it just hasn't add the chance to be sold last month but it may be sold in low quantities next month. In particular, we find that the most relevant features are target encodings of the past typical sale quantities of samples of seniority 1 in this shop, in the same category of items, and with the same number of months since it has been released, as well as the quantities sold for this item in other shops where it has been sold in the past.\n\nFinally, samples (shop, item) of seniority 0 are totally new in the catalogue. No past data is available for these pairs. Besides, the typical sale quantities of the new items vary a lot from month to month and their temporal evolution appears much noisier than older items. For these items, we base our predictions mostly on past typical sale quantities of similar items on the month where they were released. Similar items are defined as items of the same category, or same supercategory (like some other game, or some other book).\n\n- Apart from the separation between seniority levels, the influence of temporality is threefold: the quantities sold for a given item in a given shop depend on the absolute period of the year (more sales in December due to Christmas), on how many months since the item has been released (older items are less popular than newer ones), and also on the month where it has been released (items released in December are sold more all year round than items released in February). The sensitivity of the items to each of these three temporality vary from category to category and depending on the seniority level of the sample: samples of seniority 1 are almost insensitive to the absolute period of the year but very sensitive to the number of months since they have been released, while deliveries are sold in similar quantities regardless of how long the service has been offered, etc... Thus, the effect of temporality is accounted for jointly with other features through target encoding.\n\n- Three separate models are built using the XGBRegressor algorithm from xgboost. Different hyperparameters are used to account for the different distributions of target variable, different problem complexities, and different tendencies to overfit"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# system and performance\nimport gc\nimport time\nimport

are made of items that have never been sold in this shop, but have been sold in other shops before. Such a sample (shop, item) is likely to be made of an item that is not actually available in this shop, and the likelihood that this item will be sold in this shop in the future is very low. In fact, data analysis proves that only 5% of these samples contribute to the sales (compared to 20-25% of samples of seniority 2. Those few samples of seniority 1 that will be sold are likely made of items that are always sold in low quantities, possibly less than one per month. Here again, data analysis shows that the average sales for items of seniority 1 is around 0.05 (against 0.4 in seniority 2) and the likelihood that an item of seniority 1 is sold in quantities superior to 3 is less than 0.1%. Samples of seniority 1 yielding sale quantities above 8 are so rare that they may be considered noise. For seniority 1, the critical features are the number of months since it has been released in the catalogue without being sold in this shop, and the typical sale quantities of this item in shops where it has been sold in the past. If an item is typically sold in large quantities but have never been sold in a given shop, it is unlikely that it will suddenly start being sold next month. Similarly, if the item has never been sold in a given shop in spite having been released for many months in the catalogue, it is likely that it will never be sold in this shop, or only in very small quantities. Conversely, if the item has only been released last month, it is possible that it just hasn't add the chance to be sold last month but it may be sold in low quantities next month. In particular, we find that the most relevant features are target encodings of the past typical sale quantities of samples of seniority 1 in this shop, in the same category of items, and with the same number of months since it has been released, as well as the quantities sold for this item in other shops where it has been sold in the past.\n\n\nADDITIONAL REMARKS:\n- For now, we disregard the influence of the shops that have just opened. Such shops are rare in the dataset and we expect they do not impact significantly the overall result.\n\n- The temporality of items in seniority 1 seem to be mostly related to 'months_since_release', but the sales of such items do not seem to be related to the absolute period of the year, apart from a peak in December. The effect of the month of release or the time of the year apart from the Christmas period are negligible."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import
