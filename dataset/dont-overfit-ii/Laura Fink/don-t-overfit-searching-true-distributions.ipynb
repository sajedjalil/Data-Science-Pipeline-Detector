Even though we want to share our idea how to model the true distributions that may have been used to generate the data. We assumed that the competition sponsors used 2 gaussian distributions to draw random samples - a small part given as train and a big part given as test. To solve the task we tried to learn how these gaussians look like in sense of their mean and variance values. We setup a semi-supervised gaussian mixture model that starts with intial values for means and variances using the train data. Our idea was then to adjust these values by learning how the gaussians fit the test data best. Hence instead of leaderboard probing we tried to use the information that is already provided by the test data...\n\nUnfortunately our model does mad things and learning was not as expected. We are now on our journey to find out what has happened and we like to share our ideas with you. :-) Please feel free to comment, let us know what has negatively influenced the learning process in your opinion. \n\nLet's share learning experiences!

What can you do instead of logistic regression? What can you try out to cover the gaussian nature of this data?\n\nWe built up a few assumptions about the data structure to find a model that does not only try to make nice predictions but also explains how the data was generated:\n\n* The data per class was drawn using a multivariate gaussian distribution.\n* As features are almost decorrelated we expect the covariance matrix to be diagonal but with own standard deviations for each single feature. This way the multivariate gaussian turns into a factorization of single feature gaussians. \n* We guess that the mean values of unimportant features is zero whereas those of important ones slightly differ from this value.  \n* Using these assumptions we can built up a gaussian mixture model that tries to fit the test data best during learning. \n* We don't want to waste our training data and like to use class labels as guidance to fit the two gaussians.\n\n\nBefore this competiton we had no knowledge how to setup a semi-supervised mixture model but with help of this [nice paper](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/540-W16/EM.pdf) we were able to derive the learning equations for the means and standard deviations for each feature of the gaussians per target class:\n\n#### The model\n\nWe like to describe our observed data (train features and targets, test features) by a latent variable model that uses two latent variables as representatives for our hidden test targets:\n\n$$p(X,\\hat{X}, Y) = \\pi_{0} \\cdot N(X,\\hat{X}, Y|\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}) + \\pi_{1} \\cdot N(X,\\hat{X}, Y|\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1})$$\n\nTo find optimal parameters for the two gaussians that can describe our data best we need to maximize the equation with respect to the parameters. We can't do this directly and need the EM-algorithm to solve this task and for that we need the complete data log likelihood. Fortunately the paper is of great help to set it up:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}|X,Y,\\hat{X},\\theta^{old}} \\ln p(X, Y, \\hat{X}, \\hat{Y}|\\theta) = \\sum_{n} p(x_{n}, y_{n}|\\theta) + \\sum_{m} \\sum_{k} \\gamma_{km} \\ln p(\\hat{x}_{m}, \\hat{y}_{m}|\\theta)$$\n\nThe first part with $n$ describes the contribution of the training data to a gaussian distribution $k$ whereas the second part with $m$ describes the contribution of the unlabeled test data. \n\n#### E-Step\n\nThe E-Step tries to estimate how probable it is that a data point \"m\" was drawn by the current gaussian \"k\". The associated value is called responsibility. We update these responsibilities during the E-Step by using only test data spots $\\hat{x}_{m}$:\n\n$$ \\gamma_{mk} = \\frac{\\pi_{k} N(\\hat{x}_{m}|\\mu_{k}, \\sigma_{k})}{\\pi_{0} \\cdot N(\\hat{x}_{m}|\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}) + \\pi_{1} \\cdot N(\\hat{x}_{m}|\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1})}$$\n\n#### M-Step\n\nWe recompute the mean of each component and the effective number using the data spots of train and test as well as the responsibilities:\n\n$$M_{eff, k} = \\sum_{m} \\gamma_{mk}$$\n\n$$\\mu_{k} = \\frac{\\sum_{n} x_{n} + \\sum_{m} \\gamma_{mk} \\hat{x}_{m}}{N_{k}+M_{k}} $$\n\n$$\\sigma_{k} = \\frac{1}{N + M_{k}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{n} (x_{n}-\\mu_{k})^{2} + \\sum_{m} \\gamma_{km} (\\hat{x}_{m} - \\mu_{k})^{2} \\right)$$\n\n$$\\pi_{k} = \\frac{N+M_{eff,k}}{N+M_{total}} $$\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MySemiGMM:\n    \n    def __init__(self, mu, sigma):\n        \n        self.sigma = sigma\n        self.mu = mu\n        self.old_mus = []\n        self.old_sigmas = []\n        self.old_pis = []\n        self.train_roc_convergence = []\n        self.pi = [0.36, 0.64]\n    \n    def set_data(self, x_test, x_train, y_train):\n        self.x_test = x_test\n        self.y_train = y_train\n        self.x_train = x_train\n        self.hot_data = x_train[np.where(y_train==1)]\n        self.cold_data = x_train[np.where(y_train==0)]\n        self.n_hot = len(self.hot_data)\n        self.n_cold = len(self.cold_data)\n    \n    def update_Meff(self):\n        self.Meff = np.sum(self.gamma, axis=0)\n        \n    def update_pars(self):\n        denominator_cold = self.n_cold + self.Meff[0]\n        counter_cold = np.sum(self.cold_data, axis=0)\n        counter_cold += np.einsum('id,i -> d', self.x_test, self.gamma[:,0])\n        mu_cold = counter_cold/denominator_cold\n        \n        denominator_hot = self.n_hot + self.Meff[1]\n        counter_hot = np.sum(self.hot_data, axis=0)\n        counter_hot += np.einsum('id,i -> d', self.x_test, self.gamma[:,1])\n        mu_hot = counter_hot/denominator_hot \n        \n        self.mu[0] = mu_cold\n        self.mu[1] = mu_hot\n        \n        cold_var = np.sum(np.power(self.x_train - self.mu[0], 2), axis=0) \n        cold_var += np.einsum('id,i -> d', np.power(self.x_test-self.mu[0], 2), self.gamma[:,0])\n        sigma_cold = np.sqrt(1/(self.n_cold + self.Meff[0]) * cold_var)\n        \n        hot_var = np.sum(np.power(self.x_train - self.mu[1], 2), axis=0) \n        hot_var += np.einsum('id,i -> d', np.power(self.x_test-self.mu[1], 2), self.gamma[:,1])\n        sigma_hot = np.sqrt(1/(self.n_hot + self.Meff[1]) * hot_var)\n        \n        self.sigma[0] = sigma_cold\n        self.sigma[1] = sigma_hot\n        \n        self.pi[0] = (self.n_cold + self.Meff[0]) / (self.x_train.shape[0] + self.x_test.shape[0])\n        self.pi[1] = (self.n_hot + self.Meff[1]) / (self.x_train.shape[0] + self.x_test.shape[0])\n    \n    def learn(self, n_iter=10):\n        #

This is not really what we want as we like to obtain a good model for both: test and train data.  \n* Our **model tries to explain the data with only one major gaussian**. This is of course not what we wanted as we prefer a model that can describes both: the density of the data and the targets in train. \n\n\n### Trying to understand what happened\n\n* Our start values are given by the means $\\mu$ and variances $\\sigma^{2}$ per feature in the train data with respect to targets and the priors $\\pi$ by the fraction of classes in train. They define our initial gaussian distributions.\n* The first step our model takes is to compute how responsible each gaussian for a sample point in test. As the distributions are very close to each other and the prior for the gaussian that we like to explain hot targets is higher, we obtain higher probabilities for the $1$-gaussian for the majority of samples than for the other gaussian. \n* These high $\\gamma_{m,1}$ values cause high shifts in the learnt parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\pi$ and $M_{eff}$. This way we yield an even higher prior for $\\pi_{1}$ than before and the situation becomes more dramatic than before. A cycle of **\"the winner takes it all\" starts**. \n* But even in the case when we start with a high prior for the zero-component gaussian the one-component gaussian takes it all. \n* Let's take a look at the mean value: In the counter it consists of a sum computed on the train data plus a $\\gamma$ weighted sum computed on the test data. As training data is small, the first, **supervised part has only a small contribution to the learning process whereas the second, unsupervised part has a huge impact on the new mean value**. The same holds for the variance. How to solve that? I don't know if this is ok in sense of probabilities (have to check), but what about weighting the parts differently, like $0.9 * supervised + 0.1 * unsupervised$? But how to change the effective number $M_{eff}$ of samples in the current gaussian? Perhaps it's better to derive the equations using probabilities.
