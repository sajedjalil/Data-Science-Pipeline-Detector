We can interpret the 65 target columns as 65 independent univariate time series, or we can look at them as a single multivariate time series.\n\n2. We can pivot the dataframe even more to get one row per day (i.e. 183 rows for the 183 days). This gives 4680  columns or 4680 independent time series.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Original dataframe with a single target column\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 5, \"display.max_columns\", 15, \"display.width\", 120)\ntrain","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.46283Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.463064Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.479077Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.463036Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.478318Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Pivoted dataframe with every timestamp occurring only once and 65 target columns\ntrain.pivot(index=['time'], columns=['x', 'y', 'direction'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.480478Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.480904Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.932353Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.480866Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.931456Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Pivoted dataframe with one row per day and 4630 target columns\n# Note that the afternoon of the last day has been filled with NaN\ntrain2 = train.copy()\ntrain2['date'] = train2.time.dt.date\ntrain2['hour'] = train2.time.dt.hour\ntrain2['minute'] = train2.time.dt.minute\ntrain2.drop(columns=['time'], inplace=True)\ntrain2.pivot(index=['date'], columns=['x', 'y', 'direction', 'hour', 'minute'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.933806Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.934029Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-26T18:14:30.972757Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-26T18:14:29.934Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-26T18:14:30.971824Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nThis will be an interesting competition!","metadata":{}}]}
