plots measures the correlation between the observed value and the lagged value of the time series, in our case each lag is 20 minutes. Autocorrelation estimates the influence of all past observed values on the currently observed value. For example, the lag value 24 hours ago will have a strong impact on the current observed value so there will be a peak at lag 72.\n\nThe larger the lag the lower the correlation is, because more recent values have a larger impact on the current value.\n\n\n- [Resource1](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-from-scratch-autocorrelation-and-partial-autocorrelation-explained-1dd641e3076f)\n- [Resource2](https://www.alpharithms.com/autocorrelation-time-series-python-432909/) \n- [Resource3](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html)\n\n\nBefore calculating autocorrelation, we should make the time series stationary. The mean, variance, and covariance shouldn’t change over time. If you want to have a look at the stationary ACF and PACF you can have a look at this notebook: [View](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cabaxiom/tps-mar-22-sarima-linear-regression#Arima-Experiments). In this notebook I use stationary ACF and PACF plots to decide the order of a seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n> A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.
