As it's difficult to find information about the content of the different vectors our insights were generated during the application of those vectors improving our knowledge step by step.\n\nThis kernel includes the import of necessary files as well as the loading of needed packages. Some functions used in the process. Comparison of the three word vectors regarding their out-of-the-box performance, their non-ascii characters coverage  and then their perfomance having applied our preprocessing function (Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/annekel/fastpreprocess-14min-99-7-coverage-gl-ov) for more information regarding our preprocessing).\n\n1.

Comparison & Conclusion**\n\nIn general all three word vectors require similar preprocessing. Lowercase should not be applied in any of them. Punctuations should not be removed as all include some punctuation and substantial information might get lost. Contractions should be cleaned as many are unknown and with the cleaning the text gets harmonized. Also translation and spellchecking should be executed for all of them to get any possible information and reduce the noise. Lemmatization should not be performed as all vectors can handle the different word versions. Unknown words get ignored by all models and therefore need to be handled separately. Regarding the replacement of emojis FastText differs from the other two as it includes a huge amount of emojis and therefore the replacement is not necessarily needed. For the other two the replacement should be performed. Google News differs from the other two vectors in the case of the removal of stopwords. It does not include any and therefore they need to be removed. Same behaviour regarding numbers for Google News.\n\nLooking at our obtained results from this notebook GloVe and FastText seem to be the best out-of-the-box choices as they already cover around 98% of the text and around 50% of the vocabulary. Google News performs rather poorly obtaining only 77% of text coverage and 35% on the vocabulary. This performance can be explained by the above mentioned aspect that it does not cover stopwords and so a huge amount of words are unknown.\n\nMeanwhile FastText and GloVe only get slight improvements after having preprocessed data, the effect on Google News is a lot bigger but it again this can be explained with the stopwords.\n\nFastText offers an impressing amount of non-ascii characters. It covers 65% of all non-ascii characters that appear in the dataframe of the competition. Meanwhile Google News and GloVe only cover between 32 - 35%.\n\nIn the end all three vectors get to a result around 99% of text coverage. Therefore all three are good candidates for this competition. Nevertheless probably FastText and GloVe are the better choices as Google requires some additional preprocessing which might result in information getting lost."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
