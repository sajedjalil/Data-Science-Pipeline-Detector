In this exercise, you'll train a model with **real data** and get practice with identifying bias.  Don't worry if you're new to coding: you'll still be able to complete the exercise!\n\n# Introduction\n\nAt the end of 2017, the [Civil Comments](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d) platform shut down and released their ~2 million public comments in a lasting open archive. Jigsaw sponsored this effort and helped to comprehensively annotate the data.  In 2019, Kaggle held the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview) competition so that data scientists worldwide could work together to investigate ways to mitigate bias.\n\nThe code cell below loads some of the data from the competition.  We'll work with thousands of comments, where each comment is labeled as either \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\".\n\nBegin by running the next code cell.  \n- Clicking inside the code cell.\n- Click on the triangle (in the shape of a \"Play button\") that appears to the left of the code cell.\n\nThe code will run for approximately 30 seconds.  When it finishes, you should see as output a message saying that the data was successfully loaded, along with two examples of comments: one is toxic, and the other is not.\n\n> **Optional** note: The original competition data uses a toxicity score ranging from 0 to 1.  We've simplified this score to either 0 or 1 by thresholding the value: scores > 0.7 are assigned \"1\", scores < 0.3 are assigned \"0\", and comments with scores between 0.3 and 0.7 are dropped from the dataset.  Additionally, to reduce runtime, we have reduced the size of the dataset with subsampling. To preprocess the comments, we use a \"bag of words\" approach with `CountVectorizer()`.  Note that this is a simple approach, and in practice you'll want to spend time cleaning up the data.  Here's a great example for how to do that: https://www.kaggle.com/christofhenkel/how-to-preprocessing-for-glove-part1-eda","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014195,"end_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:15.040067","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:15.025872","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up feedback system\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.ethics.ex3 import *\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\n# Get the same results each time\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\n# Load the (full) training data\nfull_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/train.csv\")\n\n# Work with a small subset of the data: if target > 0.7, toxic.
