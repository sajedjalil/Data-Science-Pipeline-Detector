{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On 2018, Kaggle launched a competition in association with Jigsaw/Conversation AI to classify toxic comments. The original competition can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). A toxic comment is a comment that is rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. The goal of that competition was to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.\n\nHowever, the models developed in that competition unfortunately associated the targetted group with toxicity, i.e. \"gay\". For example, a comment like \"I am a gay woman\" would be classified as toxic. This happened as the examples of identities associated with toxicity outnumbered neutral comments regarding the same identity.\n\nTherefore, the same team launched a new competition to recognize unintended bias towards identities. We are asked to use a dataset labeled with the associated identity. Let's look into the dataset and understand it first, so we can create a model that can better deal with bias.\n\nAt the time I started this notebook, I looked at the kernel https://www.kaggle.com/nz0722/simple-eda-text-preprocessing-jigsaw to have a quick start. So I want to take a moment to thank the Author for the kernel. The purpose of this Kernel is to walk Kaggle newbies through the process of data exploration and visualization. In this notebook, we will use Pandas to do a little bit of data wrangling and Plotly and Seaborn to visualize the result of our wrangling.

What a depressing sight :( However, we should keep in mind that the distribution of data over the timeline is probably skewed. Lets check it out.\n\nAlthough there are many spikes in this dataset, there are two that really stands out to me.\n\n1. There huge spike of toxic comments against religion between 2017-01 to 2017-04. This might be because Donald Trump took office in January 2017, and during this time both people were very toxic toward various religions.\n\n2. There is a big spike on toxicity towards races in the middle period between 2017-07 to 2017-10. I did a search on [Goolge Trends on topic that was probabily hot at that time, \"black lives matter\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2017-01-07%202017-12-31&geo=US&q=black%20lives%20matter).

At that time the \"Charlottesville white nationalist rally\", which probably the reason for this spike. \n\nIt isn't my intention to go through each spike and understand what happened there. **I rather wanted to convey the point that toxicity in the comments typically seems to be triggered or an aftermath of certain events.** A little intuative and obvious, but it's always good to point out the obvious with data.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count'].plot(figsize=(15,7), linewidth=1, fontsize=15)\nplt.xlabel('Comment Date', fontsize = 15)\nplt.ylabel('Total Comments', fontsize = 15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we dont have an even distribution of data for our timeline, we can use the comment count to get a better relative weighted toxic score and see where the peaks are."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets divide by the comment count for the date to get a relative weighted toxic score\nidentity_weight_per_date_df['races_rel'] = identity_weight_per_date_df['races_total'] / identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count']\nidentity_weight_per_date_df['religions_rel'] = identity_weight_per_date_df['religions_total'] / identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count']\nidentity_weight_per_date_df['sexual_orientation_rel'] = identity_weight_per_date_df['sexual_orientation_total']  / identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count']\n# now lets plot the data\nidentity_weight_per_date_df[['races_rel', 'religions_rel', 'sexual_orientation_rel']].plot(figsize=(15,7), linewidth=1, fontsize=20) \nplt.legend(loc=2, prop={'size': 15})\nplt.xlabel('Comment Date', fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Relative Weighted Toxic Score', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets plot relative weighted toxic score for each identity of races\nidentity_weight_per_date_df[races].div(identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count'], axis=0).plot(figsize=(15,7), linewidth=1, fontsize=15)\nplt.legend(loc=2, prop={'size': 15})\nplt.xlabel('Comment Date', fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Relative Weighted Toxic Score', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets plot relative weighted toxic score for each identity of religions\nidentity_weight_per_date_df[religions].div(identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count'], axis=0).plot(figsize=(15,7), linewidth=1, fontsize=15)\nplt.legend(loc=2, prop={'size': 15})\nplt.xlabel('Comment Date', fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Relative Weighted Toxic Score', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets plot relative weighted toxic score for each identity of sexual orientation\nidentity_weight_per_date_df[sexual_orientation].div(identity_weight_per_date_df['comment_count'], axis=0).plot(figsize=(15,7), linewidth=1, fontsize=20)\nplt.legend(loc=2, prop={'size': 15})\nplt.xlabel('Comment Date', fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Relative Weighted Toxic Score', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Interesting!

On the other hand, even if we sort it, we will not be able to find all the relative maximums without writing a complex algorithm to do so.\n\nFortunately, there is a great algorithm from **scipy** library called **'argrelextrema'** that will allow us to extract the relative maximum points from our dataset.
