{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Toxic Comment Detection with PyTorch LSTM"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this kernel, I implement LSTM for toxicity prediction using only PyTorch (and torchtext) whenever possible. I have been a keras user since forever, but I notice more and more new architectures are built through PyTorch. Thus, the main purpose of building this kernel for me is to learn PyTorch. I leave some comments to explain what each section is trying to do, hopefully it can help you too.\n\nI incorporate many techniques that I have learned from other excellent kernels, shoutout to:\n- @bminixhofer: https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/simple-lstm-pytorch-version\n- @christofhenkel: https://www.kaggle.com/christofhenkel/how-to-preprocessing-for-glove-part1-eda\n\nHaving been inspired by those kernels, there are some modifications:\n- based on my EDA kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/yosefardhito/eda-annotations-lexical-and-bag-of-words), I ignore comments with both low toxicity annotator count and toxic target value between 0.4 and 0.6 because I noticed how comments with target between that range has a questionable label even for me, let alone the model. For auxiliary attributes, I use only 'insult' because it is the only attributes significantly correlated with the target column. \n- I add a simple train/dev/test split process so I can experiment with the training data alone.\n- Paddings are added at the beginning instead of after the comment.\n- Slight modification of the Simple LSTM model on the concatenation.\n\nWhy LSTM? I know from the stories of the top leaderboards that BERT and XLNet provide the best result. However, since the goal of this kernel is to learn, I prefer training a model with simpler and modifiable architecture. I want to emphasize on learning how to do it in PyTorch instead. Surely, pre-trained BERT and XLNet are next to be mastered!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import string\nimport re\nimport operator\nimport pickle\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm._tqdm_notebook import tqdm_notebook as tqdm; tqdm.pandas()\n\nfrom nltk.tokenize.treebank import TreebankWordTokenizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\nfrom torchtext.data import Example, Field, Dataset, LabelField, Iterator, BucketIterator\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.optim as optim\n\n# dataframe options to display the whole comments\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)\n\nINPUT = \"../input/\"\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

One option is to use keras text preprocessing, but I'd rather stick with pytorch family, i.e. torchtext. First, we want to transform the input into a torchtext `Dataset`. A `Dataset` is a collection of `Example`, which consists of `Field`. More info: https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html\n\nA `Field` has many useful options for NLP, among many of them are:\n- `pad_first=True` to set padding tokens added at the beginning instead of after the comment\n- `fix_length=None`, a default, to have varying length\n- `sequential=True` means the field is to be treated a sequential data. For text, set it to `True`, set otherwise for labels.\n- `use_vocab=True` whether to build vocabulary based on this field. Set to `True` for the text fields.\n\nThe downside of this approach is the slowness due to the iteration to create the `Example` and `Dataset`. There should be a better way to convert the input to torchtext `Dataset`.

We reorder the comments based on their length, such that comments with similar length is more likely to belong on the same batch. At each batch, pad every comments to the maximum comment length on that batch. Therefore, we do not need to pad 1-word comment to the max length, and training can be much quicker.\n\nI avoid truncating any of the comment because it is misleading to decide either truncate from beginning or from end. A comment can be toxic just because 1 or 2 words it contains and those words can be at the beginning or at the end. Consequently, some outlier lengthy comments will affect the padding of much shorter ones.\n\nIn torchtext, we can do sequence bucketing with `BucketIterator` class.
