method includes functions like:**\n  -** Replace contractions** by its long version such as *'I'm' --> 'I am'* or *'Let's' 'Let us'*\n  - **Replace special symbols** like dashes, underscores and slashes which are typically used to separate words. \n    It can keep words like dashes in words like* 'e-mail'* known to the embedding index while removing it for '*anti-Trump*' where the index has no entry\n  - **Replace** typical keyboard typed **smilies** into its simple translation such as *'-)' --> 'smile'*\n  - **Replace stopwords**\n  - **Clean the text from unknown characters** by either translating it or by removing it\n  - **Transform standalone numbers** for example *'5337' to '####'* to reduce noise\n  - **Replace year and hour** abbreviations to the full word\n  - TextBlob

Vocabulary from data set is build\n2. The coverage of the dataset vocabulary is compared to the embedding vocabulary\n3. Unknown words (oov = out of vocabulary) are identified\n4. The relevant pre-processings are applied towards the unknown words only \n5. A dictionary with unknown word and its correction is generated, words which could not get improved are ignored\n6. Unknown words in the text are replaced \n7. Dataset returned in a way that every word is separated by space.\n\nThus anyone who wants to use the **outcome of this pre-processing only needs to separate the words by space ( ' ' ).**\n\nTo tokenize the words in a good way we used the **TweetTokenizer,** which we found most powerful for our challenge. It keeps symbols for smilies together, however separates punctuation at the end of a sentence. Next to that it appeared to be extremely fast! We could reduce our proprocesing speed by more than 20 minutes on the full 1.8 million dataset, so that the method including coverage check takes about 16 minutes. This will be explained more in detail in the next part.\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"0p7E_d7gQ2KF","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Method"},{"metadata":{"id":"LsvFFGvwYreC","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def preprocessing_NN(df, model_vocab, calc_coverage=True, print_oov_num=100):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function is only correcting words which are not out of the box known towards the embedding dictionary.\n  It is optimized using the nltk TweetTokenizer.\n\n  Function that combines the whole pre-processing process specifically for neural networks where less pre-processing is required compared to conventional methods.\n  This means we will not remove stopwords, lemmatize or remove typical punctuation.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Set parameters\n  tokenizer = TweetTokenizer()\n  \n  # Print starting info about the pre-processing\n  starttime = datetime.datetime.now().replace(microsecond=0)\n  print('Dataset Length: ', len(df), \"Starttime: \", starttime)\n\n  def timediff(time):\n    return time - starttime\n  \n  # build a vocabulary from the text \n  vocab = build_vocab(df.comment_text)\n  print('Embedding vectors are loaded. \\n')\n  # check the coverage and receive a dictionary of unknown words\n  unknown = check_coverage(vocab,model_vocab, print_oov_num=print_oov_num)\n  # extract the list of unknown words\n  unknown = unknown.keys()\n  \n  ## Process the unknown words\n  # The replace_contractions function is applied on the data frame\n  corrected = [replace_contractions(x) for x in unknown]\n  time = datetime.datetime.now().replace(microsecond=0)\n  print(\"Contractions have been replaced.
