Models considered are naive-Bayes, logistic regression, light-GBM and a neural-network and their performance is evaluated using cross-validation. An aspect considered here is the inbalance of class frequencies. While for most algorithms in this notebook a feature matrix based on weights of particular words of the comment-text is employed (TF-idf), the neural-network approach is based on pre-trained word-embeddings.\n\n### Contents\n\n* [Introduction](#intro)\n* [The Data](#data)\n  * First exploratory analysis; Data Preparation; TF-idf\n* [Model: Naive Bayes](#NB)\n  * Model estimation; Cross-validation; Down-sampling\n* [Model: Logistic Regression](#LR)\n  * Cross-Validation; Downsampling; Rebalancing class-weights\n* [Model: Gradient Boosting (XBR)](#XBR)\n  * Cross-Validation; Rebalancing class-weights\n* [Model: Neural-Network (LTSM)](#LTSM)\n  * Cross-Validation; Rebalancing class-weights\n* [Final Thoughts](#final)\n\n_(author: T.Payer)_"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"first\"></a>\n\n# The Data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"data\"></a>\n### First exploratory analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport gc\nimport time\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text  import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, roc_curve, roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn import metrics","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the following we will load the training data and the test data.

In particular, I used the Naive Bayes model, the logistic regression model with regularization capabilities, the boosting model light-GBM, and a small neural network employing recurrent neural network layers. As performance measures I mainly considered the area-under-the-curve AUC , but also evaluated the corresponding accuracy. The data exhibit class-imbalance with approximately 11 times more none-toxic comments in the data-set than toxic messages. \n\nTo get a reliable estimate of the model performance and how it may generalize to new data I employed cross-validation using five folds. I additionally considered some techniques to deal with class-imbalances: downsampling and/ or re-weighting. Results in mean-AUC showed often some improvements although they were often small relative to the underlying variation.\n\nNaive-Bayes models achieved the lowest performance with a mean-AUC of around 0.876. The logistic regression model employing (penalty based on) a L1-regularization showed a fairly large improvement with a mean-AUC of 0.943. Application of the light-GBM exhibited similar results with a mean-AUC of 0.942. A considerable improvement could then be achieved by using a small recurrent neural network with two LSTM- layers with an approximate performance of 0.961. Due to restrictions of notebook execution-time especially computationally expensive models had to be chosen rather small. \n\nThe performance measure used for the competition was an extention of the AUC taking into account performance over different classes. For some of the models considered here,  options to adjust to this extended measure may be by adjusting the sample weights or loss functions accordingly.\n\nFinally, there were several kernels I  benefited from and I want to express my gratitude. Some of those will be listed below (although there were many more).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n**EDA**\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/kabure/simple-eda-hard-views-w-easy-code\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ekhtiar/unintended-eda-with-tutorial-notes\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/nz0722/simple-eda-text-preprocessing-jigsaw\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/s7anmerk/lean-import-to-save-ram-and-eda\n\n\n**Embeddings**\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/christofhenkel/how-to-preprocessing-for-glove-part1-eda\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/christofhenkel/how-to-preprocessing-for-glove-part2-usage\n\n\n**LTSM**\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/thousandvoices/simple-lstm?scriptVersionId=12514554\n\n\n\n**further refs**\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html\n\nhttps://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html\n\nhttp://www.tfidf.com/\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
