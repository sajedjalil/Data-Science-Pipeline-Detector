If\nyou want to match **<1+1=2>**, the correct regex is $1\\+1=2$. Otherwise, the plus sign will have a special meaning. **Note** that **<1+1=2>**, with the *backslash omitted*, is a **valid** regex. So you will **not** get an error message. But it\nwill not match **<1+1=2>**. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Regex-Directed Engine Always Returns the Left-most Match\nThis is a very important point to understand: a regex-directed engine will always return the leftmost match,\neven if a **better** match could be found later. When applying a regex to a string, the engine will start at the\nfirst character of the string. It will try all possible permutations of the regular expression at the first character.\nOnly if all possibilities have been tried and found to fail, will the engine continue with the second character in\nthe text. Again, it will try all possible permutations of the regex, in exactly the same order. The result is that\nthe regex-directed engine will return the leftmost match.\n- When applying **<cat\\>** to **He captured a catfish for his cat.**, the engine will try to match the first\ntoken in the regex **<c\\>** to the first character in the match **H**. This fails. There are no other possible\npermutations of this regex, because it merely consists of a sequence of literal characters. So the regex engine\ntries to match the **<c\\>** with the **e**. This fails too, as does matching the **c** with the space. Arriving at the 4th\ncharacter in the match, **<c\\>** matches **c**. The engine will then try to match the second token **<a\\>** to the 5th\ncharacter, **a**. This succeeds too. But then, **<t\\>** fails to match **p**. At that point, the engine knows the regex\ncannot be matched starting at the 4th character in the match. So it will continue with the 5th: **a**. Again, **<c\\>**\nfails to match here and the engine carries on. At the 15th character in the match, **<c\\>** again matches **c**. The\nengine then proceeds to attempt to match the remainder of the regex at character 15 and finds that **<a\\>**\nmatches **a** and **<t\\>** matches **t**.\n\n- The entire regular expression could be matched starting at character 15. The engine is **\"eager\"** to report a\nmatch. **It will therefore report the first three letters of catfish as a valid match**. The engine **never** proceeds\nbeyond this point to see if there are any **better** matches. The *first match* is considered good enough. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Regex's Fundamentals"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Character Sets/Classes\nCharacter sets are also called character class. **Square brackets** are used to specify character sets. Use a **hyphen** inside a character set to specify the characters' range. The order of the character range inside square brackets doesn't matter. For example, the regular expression `[Tt]he` means: `an uppercase T or lowercase t, followed by the letter h, followed by the letter e.`\n\n- **<[Tt]he>** => <font color=red>The</font> car parked in <font color=red>the</font> garage.\n\nA period inside a character set, however, means a literal period. The regular expression **<ar[.]>** means: a lowercase character a, followed by letter r, followed by a period **.** character.\n\n- **<ar[.]>** => A garage is a good place to park a c<font color=red>ar.</font>\n\n- **<[0-9]>** => Matches a **single digit between 0 and 9**. You can use more than one range.\n- **<[0-9a-fA-F]>** => Matches a **single hexadecimal digit**, case insensitively. \n- You can combine ranges and single characters. **<[0-9a-fxA-FX]>** matches a hexadecimal digit or the letter X.* Again, the order of the characters and the ranges does not matter.*\n- Find a word, even if it is misspelled, such as **<sep[ae]r[ae]te>** or **<li[cs]en[cs]e>**. \n\n### Negated Character Sets/Classes\n\nTyping a **caret(^)** after the opening square bracket will negate the character class. **The result is that the character\nclass will match any character that is <font color = red>not </font> in the character class.**\n- It is important to remember that a negated character class **still must match a character**. **<q[^u]>** does not\nmean: **<font color= red> a q not followed by a u </font>**. It means: **<font color= red a q followed by a character that is not a u </font>**. It will **not** match the\n$q$ in the string $Iraq$. It will match the $q$ and $the space$ after the $q$ in **Iraq is a country**.\n\n###  Shorthand Character Sets\n\nRegular expression provides **shorthands** for the commonly used character sets,\nwhich offer **convenient shorthands** for commonly used regular expressions. The\nshorthand character sets are as follows:\n\n|Shorthand|Description|\n|:----:|----|\n|<b>.<b>|<b>Any character except new line. It's the most commonly misused metacharacter.<b>|\n|<b>\\w<b>|<b>Matches alphanumeric characters: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`<b>|\n|<b>\\W<b>|<b>Matches non-alphanumeric characters: `[^\\w]`<b>|\n|<b>\\d<b>|<b>Matches digit: `[0-9]`<b>|\n|<b>\\D<b>|<b>Matches non-digit: `[^\\d]`<b>|\n|<b>\\s<b>|<b>Matches whitespace character: `[\\t\\n\\f\\r\\p{Z}]`<b>|\n|<b>\\S<b>|<b>Matches non-whitespace character: `[^\\s]`<b>|\n    \n## Repetitions\n\nFollowing meta characters `+`, `*` or `?` are used to specify how many times a\nsubpattern can occur. These meta characters act differently in different\nsituations.\n\n### The Star *\n\nThe symbol `*` matches zero or more repetitions of the preceding matcher. The\nregular expression `a*` means: zero or more repetitions of preceding lowercase\ncharacter `a`. But if it appears after a character set or class then it finds\nthe repetitions of the whole character set. \nFor example, the regular expression\n- `[a-z]*` means: any number of lowercase letters in a row.\n\nThe `*` symbol can be used with the meta character `.` to match any string of\ncharacters `.*`. The `*` symbol can be used with the whitespace character `\\s`\nto match a string of whitespace characters. For example, the expression\n`\\s*cat\\s*` means: zero or more spaces, followed by lowercase character `c`,\nfollowed by lowercase character `a`, followed by lowercase character `t`,\nfollowed by zero or more spaces.\n\n### The Plus +\n\nThe symbol `+` matches one or more repetitions of the preceding character. For\nexample, the regular expression `c.+t` means: lowercase letter `c`, followed by\nat least one character, followed by the lowercase character `t`. It needs to be\nclarified that `t` is the last `t` in the sentence.\n\n- **<c.+t>** => The fat <font color='red'> cat sat on the mat</font>.\n\n### The Question Mark ?\nIn regular expression the meta character `?` makes the preceding character optional. This symbol matches zero or one instance of the preceding character. For example, the regular expression `[T]?he` means: `Optional the uppercase letter T, followed by the lowercase character h, followed by the lowercase character e.`\n\n- **<[Tt]he>** => <font color=red>The</font> car parked in <font color=red>the</font> garage.\n\n### The Lazy Star *? \n\nRepeats the previous item zero or more times. Lazy, so the engine first attempts to skip the\nprevious item, before trying permutations with ever increasing matches of the preceding\nitem. \n\n|Regex|Means|\n|:----:|----|\n|abc+|        matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c|\n|abc?|       matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c|\n|abc{2}|      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c|\n|abc{2,}|    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c|\n|abc{2,5}|    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c|\n|a(bc)\\*|     matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc|\n|a(bc){2,5}|  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc|\n|**<.+>**| matches `<div>simple div</div>`|\n\n## Full stop or Period or dot **.**\n\nIn regular expressions, the dot or period is one of the most commonly used metacharacters. Unfortunately, it\nis also the most commonly misused metacharacter. The dot is short for the negated character class **<[^\\n]>** (UNIX regex flavors) or\n**<[^\\r\\n]>** (Windows regex flavors).\n\n<font color = 'Red'> <b> Use The Dot Sparingly </b> </font>\n- The dot is a **very powerful** regex metacharacter. It allows you to be **lazy**. `Put in a dot, and everything will\nmatch just fine when you test the regex on valid data. The problem is that the regex will also match in cases\nwhere it should not match..`\n    \nExample - Let’s say we want to match a date in `mm/dd/yy` format, but we\nwant to leave the user the choice of date separators. The quick solution is **<\\d\\d.\\d\\d.\\d\\d>**. Seems fine at\nfirst sight.. It will match a date like `02/12/03` just what we intended, So fine... \n- <font color='red'> <b> Trouble is: 02512703<b></font> is also considered a **valid date** by this regular expression. In this match, the first dot matched $5$, and the second matched $7$. Obviously $not$ what we intended. \n    \n## Start of String and End of String Anchors ( $ and ^)\n\nAnchors are a different breed. They do not match any character at all. Instead, they match a position before,\nafter or between characters. They can be used to `anchor` the regex match at a certain position. \n- The caret **<^>**\nmatches the position before the first character in the string. Applying **<^a>** to `abc` matches `a`. **<^b>** will\nnot match `abc` at all, because the **<b\\>** cannot be matched right after the start of the string, matched by **<^>**.\n- Similarly, **<\\$>** matches right after the last character in the string. **<c\\$>** matches `c` in `abc`, while **<a\\$>** `does not` match `abc` at all...."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Examples\n\n- Regex are now written in Quotes (\\`)\n- The String to be matched is in (\"bold\")\n\nSuppose you want to use a regex to match a list of function names in a programming language: \"**Get, GetValue, Set or SetValue.**\" \n- The obvious solution is `Get|GetValue|Set|SetValue`\n\n*Now take a look closer carefully at the regex and the string, both.\nHere are some other ways to do the same task*\n-  `Get(Value)?|Set(Value)?`\n-  `\\b(Get|GetValue|Set|SetValue)\\b`\n-  `\\b(Get(Value)?|Set(Value)?)\\b`\n- Even this one is correct `\\b(Get|Set)(Value)?\\b`\n\n**Regex**:\t`<[^>]+>`\n- **What it does**:\tThis finds any HTML, such as `<\\a>, <\\b>, <\\img />, <\\br />, etc`.

Suppose you have segments like these:\n`\nThe Web based look up is our new feature. A project manager should not proofread... Our Product Name is...`\n    - The Regex shown above would find anything between The and is, or should. With most texts, there is a good chance that anything this Regex finds is a good term that you can add to your Termbase.\n\n**Regex**:\t`\\b(a|an|A|An)\\b.*?\\b(?=\\W?\\b(is|are|was|can|shall|must |that|which|about|by|at|if|when|among|above|under|$)\\b)`\n- **What it does**:\tThis works much like the Regex shown above, except that it finds text that begins with a or an, rather than the.
