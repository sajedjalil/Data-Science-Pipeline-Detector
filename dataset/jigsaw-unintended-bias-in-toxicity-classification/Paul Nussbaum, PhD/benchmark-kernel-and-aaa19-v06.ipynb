This Kernel seeks to understand the contents of that proposed new law in the context of this data set and goals, and possibly provide an advantage in winning the competition.\n\nOne of many news articles about the bill can be found here: https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/algorithmic-accountability-act/\n## Details of the proposal\n(Disclaimer: These are my interpretations only, please read it for yourself). The proposal is based on the fact that there will be an Impact Assessment on every automated decision system that falls under the new law. Not every such system will fall under this new law.\n* Impact Assessment - ... a study evaluating an automated decision system and ... the development process, including the design and training data ... for impacts on accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy, and security.\n* The above also includes a provisions for consumers to have access to the results ... and may correct or object to its results.\n* Covered by this law - Only systems that are run by a person or company making more than 50M US Dollars/year, or has more than 1M users, or is in the business of data analysis\n* High Risk systems are also targeted - where the definition of this includes 4 major areas that pose a significant risk to A, B, C, and D\n* High Risk A - privacy or security of personal information and/or contributing to inaccurate, unfair, biased, or discriminatory decisions.\n* High Risk B - extensive evaluation of peoples work performance, economic situation, health, preferences, behavior, location, or movements.\n* High Risk C - information about race, color, national origin, political opinions, religion, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health, gender, gender identity, sexuality, sexual orientation, criminal convictions, or arrests.\n* High Risk D - uses systematic monitoring of a large publicly accessible physical place\n\nQuite a bit of ground!\n## This Competition\nThis Kernel seeks to use Word Clouds to analyze the [Competition Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview/evaluation) in light of this proposed legislation. In addition, the Word Clouds provide insight into how the performance in the competition may be improved."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Environment Setup\nFrom the \"Benchmark Kernel\" provided as part of this competition."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np #

Do we have enough slack to cull from the dictionaries and still classify with consistent accuracy? The answer may be yes, but as we examine the \"other AUC's\" below, the data gets considerably slimmer.\n\n# Additional Wordcloud Pairs\nIn the two wordclouds above, we talked about the overall accuracy of the toxic classifier (overall Area Under the Curve metric, or AUC). In the below software, we examine the issues with the BenchMark Kernel for the other AUC areas mentioned in the Competition Evaluation rules. Specifically, we will create WordCloud pairs for the three worst scores (from the original Benchmark Kernel) in the areas of \"Subgroup AUC,\" \"BPSN (Background Positive, Subgroup Negative) AUC,\" and \"BNSP (Background Negative, Subgroup Positive) AUC.\"\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What to look for in the below\nFirst, you should perform an overall sanity check. Look at the pair of wordclouds. Could you, as a human reader, pick which cloud was which from the pair of subdivided data? Many times the answer is \"yes\" but some pairs are more obvious than others.\n\nNext, look at the specifics of the pairs:\n* Are the words in the wordclouds, especially the larger font words, really representative of words that you would expect to see only in one subset and not the other? Why or why not?\n* If you really don't like a bunch of the words, imagine that you (or machine learning) removes them from the list. Do the word counts justify enough remaining words to do the classification?\n* What other techniques might you use besides these \"subtracted dictionaries\" to subdivide the space more accurately? \n* LSTM and other recurrent time varying models focus on the sequence of words, not just the individual words. Even a Hidden Markov Model could be used as a probability sequencer. How might you sanity check the \"sequence dictionaries\" just as the wordclouds helped you sanity check the word subsets."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Poorly scored AUC Subgroups\n## Subgroup AUC: \nHere, we restrict the data set to only the examples that mention the specific identity subgroup.
