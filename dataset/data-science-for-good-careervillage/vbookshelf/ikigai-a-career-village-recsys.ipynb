Introduction"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"02be8eb9441f4eaf33945eca3e1c982b7b0b5c09"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you're like me then alot of your emails are unopened. It's because you know from reading the title or just from the sender's name that you've got no interest in the content. Who cares if a city that you visited 6 months ago now has \"some great deals on hotel rooms\". Our brains are becoming efficient content filters. Anything that's not relevant will be ignored.\n\nThat's why it's important for CareerVillage to have a good recommender system (RecSys). Professionals need to feel that the questions sent to them are relevant. Creating a personalized experience will make them feel valued. This will lead to more questions being answered and faster answers.\n\nThe objective of this competition is to develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.\n\nThis solution follows two steps:<br>\n\n*Step 1*: Develop a method to recommend relevant questions to professionals.<br>\n*Step 2*: Identify those professionals who are most likely to answer a relevant question.\n\nIt's not practical to measure the quality of this solution using an evaluation metric. To overcome this we will assess the results qualitatively using a simple run and read approach. \n\nIn step 1 you'll ask a question. Then you'll look at the professionals that each model recommendeds and ask: \"Based on this person's  profile or past answer, will this recommended professional be **capable** of answering this question?\"<br>\nThis is an intuitive way of assessing the relevance of your question to a particular professional.\n\nIn step two, to assess whether or not a professional will respond to a relevant question, this system will look at four indicators:\n\n1. Is this professional a new member?\n2. Has this professional answered a past question from this student?\n3. Did this professional answer a question recently?\n4. Did this professional make a comment recently?\n\nUsing this filter, this system will generate a final list of professionals that are likely to respond to your question.\n\nA central feature of this system is that it compares your question to each professional's background info or to all answers in the dataset. If the question is similar to a particular professional's background or to a past answer that he or she gave - then it's likely that that professional is able to answer your question. In other words, your question is relevant to that professional.\n\n\n**RecSys Architecture**\n\nThis recommender system is made up of the four models and a filter:<br>\n\n( A professional's profile is made up of the industry they work in and their title. )\n\n- Model 1 uses tags followed, professional profiles and tfidf (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)\n- Model 2 uses professional profiles, past answers and tfidf\n- Model 3 uses professional profiles, past answers, tfidf and Truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)\n- Model 4 uses professional profiles, past answers and GloVe pre-trained word embeddings  (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n\nWhy do we need four models? It's because not all models perform equally well on all questions. This is a small dataset and different careers are not equally represented. For example theres a lot of professionals with a computer science background but few firefighters. Professions are well represented. Trades are not. Also, not all questions are about specific careers, some are about life. Therefore, having a diversity of models that tackle the problem in different ways is the most prudent approach.\n\n**Interactive Notebook**\n\nThis notebook is set up in such a way that you'll be able to select a question from the dataset, run the entire notebook and then see a printout of results for each model, and for the filter. There's also an option to type in your own question as you would on the CareerVillage website.\n\n**Testing and Results**\n\nDoes this recommender system work? Yes it does. \n\nTo demonstrate this fact I've tested it on nine questions that are representative of the data. The number of recommendations produced and the number of false positives in those recommendations is tabulated in section 10.\n\n\nMy goal here is to build a working prototype. Let's start by preparing the data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"322f7c1bf7028fdb8440bd8c154f7ebe3bffce54"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| <a id='Prepare_the_Data'></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ecf6a2989c743f02fb4570856fbbd78dee821e96"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Tfidf encodes word frequency but  embedding vectors encode the \"meaning\" of words and are able to understand analogies such as: man is to woman as king is to queen. In other words, embedding vectors help a model understand that the words man, woman, king and queen are all gender related. Moreover, a model will understand that king and queen are royalty.\n\nIn addition to trying to create relevant matches, here I'm using embedding vectors to increase the diversity of answers (more viewpoints) that student's receive. For example, if a student asks how to become a film star, it would be good if that student also received advice from people involved in theatre. This would be possible because the model would know that the words film and theatre are closely related.\n\nThis model will encode words using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. We will use 200-dimensional english word vectors. These were pre-trained on the combined Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5th Edition corpora (6B tokens, 400K vocab). Because GloVe vectors are available as a Kaggle dataset I've simply imported them into this kernel.\n\nThe embedding vector length is 200. For each answer we'll consider only the first 500 words (max_length = 500). Shorter answers will be padded with zeros. For long answers, all words beyond the first 500 will be thrown away. To create a vector for a given answer, we will average all the 200-long word vectors that make up that answer.\n\nAgain, this model will compare your question to all answers in the dataset. If your question is similar to a past answer then there's a good chance that the professional who gave that answer will be able to answer your question.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4f4cf7e01a35f910f72c55c81cb0c3dbd7505986"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.1.

One shows the number of recommendations, the other shows the number of false positives (bad matches) in those recommendations. To determine the number of false positives I looked at the output of each model and counted how many recommended professionals I believed were not well matched to the question. This is a subjective way of assessing performance, but it gives us a rough idea of how each model is performing.\n\nFor example, Model_3_TSVD recommended 140 professionals to answer the question: \"I want to major in computer science. What classes should I take?\" There was one false positive in the output. In the dataframe the results are displayed like this - rec: 140 fp: 1\nAfter filtering, the system concluded that 29 professionals are likely to respond to the email. These final recommendations contain one false positive - rec: 29 fp: 1\n\n\nThese are the cosine similarity thresholds for each model:\n\nMODEL_1_THRESHOLD = 0.13<br>\nMODEL_2_THRESHOLD = 0.1<br>\nMODEL_3_THRESHOLD = 0.65<br>\nMODEL_4_THRESHOLD = 0.94"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_results.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>\n\n**Observations**<br>\n\nThis system is performing well on careers for which a lot of data is available. Examples include the computer science, military and data science questions. \n\nFor questions about firefighting, psychology and plumbing the number of final recommendations is low. The models are also generating a higher ratio of false positives. There are professionals in the dataset that are qualified to answer these questions and the system is detecting them. But, the final filter is rejecting these professionals because they are not active. Therefore, I believe that the problem is not with this recommendation system. There's just not enough data representing these careers.\n\nStill, this highlights a weakness of this recommender system: For certain questions, especially those where a career has a low representation in the data, model 4 has a tendency to generate many false positives. To see a demonstration of this try entering index 2018 (question id:  b53c5e9b7436453fa13a416a23b512cc). This is a question about becoming a Politician. \n\nFor the more general/life-skills realted questions...\n\n~ How do I decide what career I want to choose?<br>\n~ What are the challenges I may face pursuing a career in science, and how can I stand out among the rest?<br>\n~ What are the best ways to maintain a work and school balance?\n\n...Model 4 (GloVe) is performing well. It's nicely making up for the weakness that the other three models are showing. \n\n**Is this a good recommender system?**<br>\n\nBased on these tests my preliminary conclusion is that this recommender system works. However, one should be careful about drawing conclusions after only a quick test like this. This system needs to be field tested. Only then will we know how robust it really is.\n\n**Now just a few thoughts on setting thresholds...**\n\nI've tried to reduce the number of irrelevant recommendations (i.e. bad match between question and professional) by setting model 3 and model 4 thresholds to be quite high. Reducing the number of false positives is important to inspire confidence in this system and reduce the amount of irrelevant questions sent to professionals. \n\nAs an example, consider the question: \n\"I want to become an army officer. What can I do to become an army officer?\"\n\nAt the current threshold of 0.94 Model 4 is generating 0 recommendations. However, if this threshold were lowered to 0.85 Model 4 would generate 305 recommendations. This would cause an increase in the number of false positives. In addition to recommending more professionals with a military background, Model 4 would also recommend police officers.\n\nMoreover, if the threshold was set at 0.85 then model 4 would generate 38,220 recommendations when given the very general question: \"What are the best ways to maintain a work and school balance?\" \n\n38,220 (contains duplicates) is a lot of professionals and one might guess that many false positives would be generated... but think again - would you or I consider such a question irrelevant?\n\nThat said, when choosing these thresholds it's important to consider **business priorities**. One of CareerVillage's priorities is 'No question left behind' meaning that no question should be left unanswered. In this case an executive decision could be made to use lower thresholds. The benefit would be that there would be a higher possibility that a question would get an answer because the system would output a longer list of recommended professionals. The risk is that the number of irrelevant questions sent to professionals will increase. One way to manage this risk would be to warn professionals ahead of time that a new system is being tested and request their patience (and possibly their feedback) as the system is being tuned. \n\nAnother point to consider is that these thresholds are dictated by the amount and quality of the data. As the amount of data increases, these thresholds could be adjusted. This system is not static. Its ongoing performance will need to be monitored. With time it could get better as data quantity increases or it could get worse if the data becomes polluted, with spam for example.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>\n| <a id='Things'></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 11. Things to keep in mind"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Domain knowledge is like the force, use it...**\n\nIf you are a domain expert i.e you work for CareerVillage or you're an experienced career counselor or child psychologist, then you may be able to use the practical insights you have to improve this solution. \n\nI suggest starting by looking at the filter. Are the conditions too strict? Are there better conditions that can be added?<br>\nYou can then try tuning the threshold values or tuning other model parameters to see if the quality and quantity of the recommendations improve. Also, this system is set up so that the models work independantly. Therefore, it's possible to experiment by including and excluding certain models.\n\n**Be careful...**\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, please be careful when lowering the threshold value for model 4 (GloVe). If a question is very general then this model may cast a wide net and recommend thousands of professionals. This could crash the system.\n\n**What steps can be taken to address the cold start problem?**\n\nSay you've just signed up as a shopper on Amazon. The site won't know the most relevant products to recommend to you because you've never bought anything i.e. you don't have a shopping history. This is called the cold start problem. \n\nHere the new professionals are the \"shoppers\" and the \"products\" are the questions.\n\nIn this recommender system Model 1 gives every professional a chance to be paired with a question. It relies on tags and professional profiles. \n\n(Reminder: A Professional's profile includes a professional's industry and title.)\n\nTherefore, one way of tackling the cold start problem is to encourage new professionals to complete their tag and profile information. There are many professionals whose info is incomplete or sparse. New professionals will have a better chance of being matched if they provide complete and detailed information about themselves. \n\nAnother way of addressing the cold start problem is to simply do nothing. Professionals are currently able to scroll the forums to find questions to answer. With time cold start issues will resolve themselves as these professionals find and answer questions. Once they answer a question Model 2, 3 or 4 will automatically match them to more questions.\n\n**Fairness**\n\nOne of the requirements for fairness is a diverse dataset. This isn't always easy to create for many reasons, one being that the perspective of those creating it may be limited. Let me explain using a professions vs trades example. (Please note that the term bias here means one-sidedness. Not bias in the sense of bias/variance.)\n\nSociety tends to esteem professions above trades. Those of us who've reaped the social and financial rewards of a university education would naturally want to encourage all children to follow this path. But not all children want to be doctors. Many can find secure, fullfilling and often lucrative careers as plumbers and electricians. Not everyone knows that such opportunities exist outside the university system.\n\nIf CareerVillage's marketing team were to target a predominantly white-collar demographic when trying to attract new professionals - then the number of university educated professionals in the dataset will be higher, and growing faster, than the number of tradesmen or tradeswomen. This will lead to a data bias in favour of professions. Any alogorithms constructed using this data will reflect this bias. The consequence - students who submit questions about learning a trade won't get answers. This would be an \"exculsionary user experience\", also known as discrimination. All because the data is not diverse.\n\nHere's an enlightening TED talk on algorithmic bias:<br>\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms?language=en#t-232473\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>\n| <a id='Ideas'></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 12. Ideas for sharpening this system"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Include a Stoplist**<br>\n\nA stoplist is a pre-defined list of root words. It can be used to blacklist professionals who've given answers or have profiles that contain words that are in the stoplist. The recommender system shouldn't know that these professionals exist.\n\nWhy? CareerVillage meets a very real need. It's certain to become popular with more students and professionals, in more countries. Unfortunately this increase in popularity will attract both the good and the bad - human and bot. It's important to build a stoplist into the recommender system that will exclude certain professionals from the final output when that person is promoting an agenda that's contrary to the CareerVillage value system.\n\n**Train a Neural Network to automatically rate the quality of answers**<br>\n\nThe CareerVillage vision is to give students answers that are tailored, reliable, encouraging and inspirational. There are many answers in the dataset that meet these requirements. Unfortunately, there are also answers that don't. Being able to automatically rate the quality of answers may help improve them.\n\nHow might this be done?<br>\n\nThe main pre-requisite is a labeled dataset. Once this is in place one could train a deep neural network to read each answer and then rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 according to the CareerVillage [Pro Tips](https://medium.com/@careervillage/introducing-protips-2d4ad51c445a) guidelines. This neural network could have one of several architectures - DNN, CNN, RNN or even BERT, which is a state of the art pre-trained network created by Google. \n\nHowever, factors such as memory requirements, training time, inference time, web page load time, maintenance complexity and hosting costs will need to be considered when deciding if this idea is feasible.\n\n\n**Add \"Recent Login\" as a criteria for selecting professionals**\n\nIf a professional visited CareerVillage recently then he or she was probably scrolling through the forums reading the questions and answers. There's a good chance that this person will respond to an email notification to answer a relevant question. Login information is not part of this dataset. The following condition should be added to the filter:<br>\n\"Has this professional visited the site in the last 14 days?\"\n\n**Encourage all professionals to complete their profile information**\n\nThere are many professionals who have incomplete or sparse profile information. This recommender system relies on profile information. If more professionals provide complete profiles then the performance of this system will improve.\n\n**Add 'About me' and 'Career Stories' to the profile information**\n\nOn some professional's CareerVillage profile page there are sections called \"About me\" and \"Career Stories\". In these sections they share what their career path has been, life experiences, past mistakes, what they do on a typical work day and other useful personal information and experiences. Here's a good example:<br>\nhttps://www.careervillage.org/users/9852/kim/\n\nThis data is not included in this dataset, possibly because only a few professionals choose to share this information. \"About me\" and \"Career Stories\" could be a valuable data source for this recommender system. Including them will also help address the cold start problem."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7b38e6827334b7656ee2b993cbee1d904d652ef1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| <a id='Citations'></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5f3601f71dc5b71ad92059592732f30f5a5ca88d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Citations"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ab3e13673ae75a2719de6135c867236a558f897"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.
