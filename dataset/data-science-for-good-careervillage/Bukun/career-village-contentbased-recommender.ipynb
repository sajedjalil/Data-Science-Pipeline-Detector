Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.                     \n\nIn this competition, we develop a **Content Based Recommender**  to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.                     \n\nThe Contentbased recommender makes use of the concept that if a professional has answered a question, then the professional would be recommended **SIMILAR questions**.\n\n**Step 1 - Preprocessing - Questions Title and Body**            \nExtract features using the Question Body and Title. Make a feature vector with these attributes for each of the questions              \n\n**Step 2 - Preprocessing Questions Tags**        \nGet the tags associated with the questions. Create a Tags vector for each of the questions\n\n**Step 3 - Create the Questions Feature Vector**   \nCreate a feature vector consisting of Question Body , Title and Tags by merging the Questions Body , Title and Tags\n\nAt the end of Step 3, we have for all questions a feature vector consisting of Body, Title and Tags\n\n**Step 4 - Get Questions answered by a professional**              \nGet all the questions associated with a professional.\n\n**Step 5 -  Find Similiar Questions**              \nFind Similiar Questions which have been answered by the professional. **Cosine Similarity** is used to calculate the similarity between the questions.\n\n**Step 6 - Questions based on Professional Tags**       \nThe professionals are associated with Tags. The questions are also associated with Tags. In this step, we recommend questions based on the same tags associated with professionals and questions. This last step also helps professionals who have not started answering any questions.

Why?   **           \n\nThe model chooses to predict Questions given a Professional. The idea came when I joined as a professional, I was recommended certain questions.Now when a new question arrives , the program can run and can recommend this question to professionals.         \n\n<hr/>\n*  **Question - Does your model address the \"cold start\" problem for Professionals who just signed up but have not yet answered any questions? How'd you approach that challenge?**       \n\nStep 6 of the algorithm addresses the cold start problem. The professionals are associated with Tags. The questions are also associated with Tags. In this step, we recommend questions based on the same tags associated with professionals and questions. This last step also helps professionals who have not started answering any questions.     \n<hr/>\n* **Question - Did your model have any novel approaches to ensuring that \"no question gets left behind\"?  **      \n\nThe last step ensures that the matching of the tags of the professional and the questions ensures that no questions are left behind.\n\n<hr/>\n\n* **Question - What types of models did you try, and why did you pick the model architecture that you picked?  **    \n\nThe models tried were the **Content Based Recommender** with Professionals and Questions tag matching  and the **Collaborative Filtering** method. The first method **Content Based Recommender** with Professionals and Questions tag matching gave better accuracy.         \n\n<hr/>\n* **Question -  Did you engineer any new data features? Which ones worked well for your model? **\n\nIn the Content Based Recommender, we engineered TF-IDF features from the Questions Body and Title. This we had combined with the Questions tags. This helps us to extract important words from the Questions Body and Title.\n\n<hr/>\n\n* **Question -  Is there anything built into your approach to protect certain Professionals from being \"overburdened\" with a disproportionately high share of matches?**          \n\nIn Step 6 , we match the Professionals tag with the Questions tag. In order that the Professionals are not overburdened, we remove the Top N tags of the questions from matching. This is presently configured to 50. The developer at Career Village can configure this to any desired value. This ensures that Professionals from being \"overburdened\" with a disproportionately high share of matches\n\n<hr/>\n\n* **Question -  What do you wish you could use in the future (that perhaps we could try out on our own as an extension of your work)?**\n\nThis program could be deployed in Production. Career Village can clean the tags associated with the questions and professionals for much better accuracy. In future more templatized questions will help in doing better question similarity\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
