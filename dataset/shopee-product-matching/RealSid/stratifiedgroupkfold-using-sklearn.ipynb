For example is the enitre training datasets is comprised of 40 % class 1 , 50 % class 2 and 10 % class 3 examples then the sample taken to train should also have 40 % class 1 , 50 % class 2 and 10 % class 3 examples. Another kind of cross validation split is called the **GroupKFold**. It is used when the data has underlying grouping. For example I have a product that is produced is batches, the products can be grouped by the batch id, I might need to create folds such that all the products of a batch are in one fold and do not overlap with any other fold. The difference between KFold, StratiifiedKFold and GroupKFold is visualised below.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='visualise'></a>\n## Visualising different split techniques","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Example taken from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import (TimeSeriesSplit, KFold, ShuffleSplit,\n                                     StratifiedKFold, GroupShuffleSplit,\n                                     GroupKFold, StratifiedShuffleSplit)\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Patch\nnp.random.seed(1338)\ncmap_data = plt.cm.Paired\ncmap_cv = plt.cm.coolwarm\nn_splits = 4\n\ncvs = [KFold, GroupKFold, ShuffleSplit, StratifiedKFold,\n       GroupShuffleSplit, StratifiedShuffleSplit, TimeSeriesSplit]\n\n\nn_points = 100\nX = np.random.randn(100, 10)\n\npercentiles_classes = [.1, .2, .3,.4]\ny = np.hstack([[ii] * int(100 * perc)\n               for ii, perc in enumerate(percentiles_classes)])\n\n# Evenly spaced groups repeated once\ngroups = np.hstack([[ii] * 10 for ii in range(10)])\n\n\ndef visualize_groups(classes, groups, name):\n    # Visualize dataset groups\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.scatter(range(len(groups)),  [.5] * len(groups), c=groups, marker='_',\n               lw=50, cmap=cmap_data)\n    ax.scatter(range(len(groups)),  [3.5] * len(groups), c=classes, marker='_',\n               lw=50, cmap=cmap_data)\n    ax.set(ylim=[-1, 5], yticks=[.5, 3.5],\n           yticklabels=['Data\\ngroup', 'Data\\nclass'], xlabel=\"Sample index\")\n\ndef plot_cv_indices(cv, X, y, group, ax, n_splits, lw=10):\n    \"\"\"Create a sample plot for indices of a cross-validation object.\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate the training/testing visualizations for each CV split\n    for ii, (tr, tt) in enumerate(cv.split(X=X, y=y, groups=group)):\n        # Fill in indices with the training/test groups\n        indices = np.array([np.nan] * len(X))\n        indices[tt] = 1\n        indices[tr] = 0\n\n        # Visualize the results\n        ax.scatter(range(len(indices)), [ii + .5] * len(indices),\n                   c=indices, marker='_', lw=lw, cmap=cmap_cv,\n                   vmin=-.2, vmax=1.2)\n\n    # Plot the data classes and groups at the end\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 1.5] * len(X),\n               c=y, marker='_', lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 2.5] * len(X),\n               c=group, marker='_', lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n\n    # Formatting\n    yticklabels = list(range(n_splits)) + ['class', 'group']\n    ax.set(yticks=np.arange(n_splits+2) + .5, yticklabels=yticklabels,\n           xlabel='Sample index', ylabel=\"CV iteration\",\n           ylim=[n_splits+2.2, -.2], xlim=[0, 100])\n    ax.set_title('{}'.format(type(cv).__name__), fontsize=15)\n    return ax","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cvs = [KFold, StratifiedKFold, GroupKFold]\n\n\nfor cv in cvs:\n    this_cv = cv(n_splits=n_splits)\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 3))\n    plot_cv_indices(this_cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits)\n\n    ax.legend([Patch(color=cmap_cv(.8)), Patch(color=cmap_cv(.02))],\n              ['Testing set', 'Training set'], loc=(1.02, .8))\n    # Make the legend fit\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    fig.subplots_adjust(right=1)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a  id='stratifiedgroupkfold'></a>\n## StratifiedGroupKFold\n\nStatifiedGroupKFold is useful when our underlying data has groups (in this competition **label_group**) and we also want that the training sample must have similar distribution of data (in our case similar distribution of products with high and low number of macthing product).
