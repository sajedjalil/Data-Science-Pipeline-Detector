The score deteriorated slightly from the original CV. This was kind of expected. The number of false +ves generated would have increased dramatically. In fact I was expecting a far worse score that this. Now here is how we can actually utilize this bit of PP - First, in the regular ML program, we will make the cosine similarity check far more stringent that before. So any matches now are pretty sure to be 'actual' matches. Now we add this additional bit of PP to build transitive relations and expand the 'matches' column. Hopefully this returns a better score. To understand better, take a simple case where A is similar to B(with text comparision) and C(with image comparision). Now this automatically implies that our algorithm will return that B is similar to A and C is similar to A. But what happens if the text for B is not very closely related to the text for C (maybe it just falls below the cut-off criteria or maybe it contains translated words hence there is no matching) and the images of B and C also dont match (maybe the angles and lighting are different). So in that case B need not be equal to C as per our model. But we do know that this cant be the case - if A is equal to B and C (assuming we have high confidence because we have set high cut-offs) then B & C must simply be equal even though our model says No. \n\nCan we exploit this fact? Let us see..\n\nBefore that, let us load Rapids and calculate the cosine simialrity.

It does not go beyond 72.4 which was our original CV. A failed experiment then? Depends. We could see that the stringent score CV improves from 68.1 to 68.8 when we consider transitive relationships. The idea is sound but the implementation failed (reminds me of a dialog from the Ghost and the darkness movie from a young Michael Douglas). Anyway, the challenge is that if we reduce the stringency, then we get lots of false positives and the score actually drops due to the PP. Increasing stringency causes the CV to drop initially but even after PP, it does not recover back to its original level. \n\nFor this PP to work, we need stringency but the moment we make cut-off stringent, the CV drops big time and the gains from PP are not enough to go past its original mark. Can we find a sweet spot where CV does not drop too much and the gains from PP carry it past the older score? Would having sharper differentiation between embeddings work? Theoritically it should but unfortunately I couldnt make it work in the limited time I had and it would be nice if someone could fix this. One option could be to go back to those records which have huge number of matches and then try increasing stringency level cut-offs onlhy for those records and then do the PP only for those. Another option is to do this PP only for those records where we are 100% sure of a match.\n\nIn any case, due to work constraints I would be taking a break of a couple of months from Kaggle - at least no new comps or kernels, though I hope I should be able to occassionally keep myself upto date on the discussions happening. All the best to all participants of Shoppe and I will be eagery awaiting the results day discussions.","metadata":{}}]}
