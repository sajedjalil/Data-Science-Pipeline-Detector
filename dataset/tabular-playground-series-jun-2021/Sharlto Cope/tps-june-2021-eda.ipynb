In the past, Kaggle have launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than Featured competition, and thus more beginner-friendly.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition.\n\nThe dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting the category on an eCommerce product given various attributes about the listing. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using multi-class logarithmic loss. Each row in the dataset has been labeled with one true Class. For each row, you must submit the predicted probabilities that the product belongs to each class label. The formula is:\n\n$$ \\text{log loss} = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^My_{ij}\\log(p_{ij}), $$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of rows in the test set, $M$ is the number of class labels, $\\text{log}$ is the natural logarithm, $y_{ij}$ is 1 if observation $i$ is in class $j$ and 0 otherwise, and $p_{ij}$ is the predicted probability that observation $i$ belongs to class $j$.\n\nThe submitted probabilities for a given product are not required to sum to one; they are rescaled prior to being scored, each row is divided by the row sum. In order to avoid the extremes of the $\\text{log}$ function, predicted probabilities are replaced with $max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})$.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"2\"></a>\n# 2 Preparations\nPreparing packages and data that will be used in the analysis process.

A correct classfication may help to make a better prediction but it’s hard to be done as there is no description and information about the features.\n- All of features have a `minimum` and `1st quartile` values of `0` which is stil the same of `median` except for median `feature_12`, `feature_18`, `feature_19`, `feature_20`, `feature_31`, `feature_39`, `feature_43`, `feature_50`, `feature_54` and `feature_56`.\n- Most of the features have a mean below 3, except for `feature_43` and `feature_54`.\n\n### 3.1.1 Quick view\nBelow is the first 5 rows of train dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.618241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.618547Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.68532Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.618519Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.683936Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dimension and number of missing values in the train dataset is as below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Number of rows: {train_df.shape[0]};  Number of columns: {train_df.shape[1]}; No of missing values: {sum(train_df.isna().sum())}')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.687476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.687821Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.738179Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.687788Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.736665Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The train dataset has `200,000` of rows with `77` of columns and there is `0` missing values which is good as there will be no extra step needed to take care of them.\n\n### 3.1.2 Data types\nExcept `target` column, all of the other columns are in `int64` type. *(to see the details, please expand)*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.dtypes","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.740759Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.741283Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.753318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.741222Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.751816Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.3 Basic statistics\nBelow is the basic statistics for each variables which contain information on `count`, `mean`, `standard deviation`, `minimum`, `1st quartile`, `median`, `3rd quartile` and `maximum`.\n\n#### 3.1.3.1 Id and features column","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.describe()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.755507Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.756159Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-08T04:52:05.4774Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-08T04:52:04.756029Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-08T04:52:05.476439Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 3.1.3.2 Target column\nThere will be `9 classes` that will be predicted in this competition.
