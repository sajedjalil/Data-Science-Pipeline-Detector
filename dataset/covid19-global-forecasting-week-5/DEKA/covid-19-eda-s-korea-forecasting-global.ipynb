For a resident in one of the epicentres of COVID-19, this data must be heartbreaking but valuable sources to learn from\n3. We Kagglers as data scientists may have a sort of duty to confront this crisis more seriously and collaboratively than ever\n4. It's better to confess that I have not enough knowledge nor skills on data science to tackle this professionally\n5. But I decided to dive as soon as possible after I found this initiative. Because it's a matter and war of timing\n6.

[Age](#eda_age)\n    - 20s are the most infected age group (27.80% to total)\n    - Older than 70 are the most deceased age group (48.08% to total)\n    - Countries need to separate the two groups while preventing spreads as a whole\n2. [Region](#eda_location)\n    - The more populated, the more cases in general (excluding 2 outliers)\n    - What's riskier are community-level gatherings like religious events\n    - Countries better try to prevent them and detect the particular event if it occured\n3. [Sex](#eda_sex)\n    - Any significant difference between sexes was not found\n    - Females seem more prone to be infected (58.91% VS. 41.09%)\n    - Males seem more prone to be deceased (51.92% VS. 48.08%)\n4. [Test](#eda_test)\n    - The number of tests and negative/released cases have kept increasing linearly\n    - Confirmed/deceased cases show more dynamic slope changes than above three while increasing\n    - Daily confirmed cases have the second spike around 2020-05-11 (a probable sign of the 2nd wave)\n5. [Path](#eda_path)\n    - Up to 60% cases seemed to be transmitted by 1 specific gathering (Sinchonji Church in Daegu)\n    - The following paths are also from groups like workplaces\n    - The imported cases from abroad keep increasing\n6. [Weather](#eda_weather)\n    - Weather-related features show no clear correlation with infections\n    - There is a weak negative correlation between temperature and infections (colder & more infections)\n    - There is a weaker positive correlation between maximun wind speed and infections (more wind & more infections)\n7. [Patient](#eda_patient)\n    - Half of the logged patients have <=4 contacts with (or possible infections to) other patients before confirmed\n    - There are outliers with more than 1,000 contacts though\n    - The average number of contacts by a patient per day has decreased as time went by\n8. [Seoul](#eda_seoul) (the capital of S.Korea)\n    - Floating population shows a positive correlation with the number of infections (more floating & more infections)\n    - The activities of older than 60 decreased after the outbreak of COVID-19\n    - The absolute number of cases in each subregion is too small (<100) to draw a conclusion from\n9. [Search](#eda_search)\n    - Searching on pneumonia was prior to that on COVID-19\n    - Increase of COVID-19 searches has been ahead of the actual increase of confirmed cases\n    - The searching itself and the number of daily new cases have decreased (with a small spike around 2020-05-11)\n10. [Policy](#eda_policy)\n    - Level 3 (2nd highest) caution on infectious diseases was implemented proactively\n    - Policies on immigration have kept updated for more countries while the borders are open\n    - Educational measures are yet shifting 'complete closure' > 'online classes' > 'physical classes (some graders)'\n11. [Activity](#eda_activity) (discarded from the original dataset as of 2020-06-30)\n    - Half of the documented patients have <=4 activity logs for 2 weeks before confirmed\n    - The most visited places are hospitals followed by stores, public transportations and restaurants\n    - Countries should apply a lot stricter preventing measures on these places","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='fc_lessons'></a>\n# [[Lessons from forecasting]](#table)\n1. [Linear Regression / Naive / Average](#fc_basics)\n    - Linear regression(LR) model on search trends could match a general trend of infections\n    - Naive forecasting (by 1 last observation) learns the latest change on the fly\n    - Moving average forecasting (by 7 latest observations) works better than LR and naive\n    - The ensembled model of the three gives the best score\n2. [ARIMA](#fc_arima)\n    - ARIMA requires basic understandings on auto regression, deferencing and moving average to set 3 parameters\n    - A grid search can yeild a better performance than the model with empirically picked parameters\n    - A Rolling-based model learning every prediction as the latest observation tends to underestimate the truth\n3. [Prophet - basics](#fc_prophet_basics)\n    - The data with 1 infection cycle of increase and decrease are not enough to feed Prophet\n        - which is mainly for catching repetitive cyclic and/or seasonal patterns with a global trend\n    - S.Korea and some countries have only 1 cycle as they are now fighting against the 1st wave of COVID-19\n    - Many others have less than 1 cycle as their curves are not flattening yet (meaning they are in the earlier phase)\n4. [Prophet - space to time](#fc_prophet_fit)\n    - We clustered the countries by recent_to_max equation\n        - which is the ratio of the latest daily cases to the max daily cases in a country\n    - Then used the data of the countries with <0.1 ratio (<10% to max) to make 1 long time series\n    - Prophet learned the general cycle of spreading with a reasonable accuracy\n        - but the scale of predictions is about half of the truth\n        - we scaled and amplified them to match the top with 100% and bottom with 0% daily confirmed cases ratio\n5. [Prophet - time to space](#fc_prophet_apply)\n    - These predictions could give insights to the countries in the earlier phase\n        - on how long does it take to quit the 1 cycle of spreading\n            - to prepare necessary resources\n            - to design a longterm exit plan\n            - to make an effort to shorten the expected time to quit\n    - For the country with median of recent_to_max\n        - the predictions match with the truth in terms of exponential increasing to the peak\n        - the spreading pace from first case to the peak also is aligned with the truth\n        - regarding this, the expected time to approach the late phase is about 1.5 months","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='eda'></a>\n# [[EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis]](#table)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Enviroment setting / Get data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"### [Environment setting]\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\n## 0.

Preliminary (exploratory) analysis\n        1) Possible features found by EDA\n            - strong: search trends (APPLIED)\n                - turned out to be useful for linear regression\n            - mild: floating population\n            - weak: weather (temperature, max_wind_speed)\n        2) Possible strategies for selecting features\n            - feature importances (with decision trees)\n            - correlation matrix\n            - dimensionality reduction (with PCA)\n    4. Choosing and fitting models\n        1) Linear regression (APPLIED)\n            - more feature engineering needed\n            - how to predict future confirmed cases only with past search trends\n                - apply forecasting method on predictions by a linear regression to stretch them out\n        2) Models from the textbook \"Forecasting: Principles and Practice\"\n            - ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (APPLIED)\n                - turned out not to work well with a simple parameter selection\n        3) Facebook Prophet (APPLIED)\n            - catches the global shape and seasonality with a proper season size\n            - can learn more general shape with more data of repeating cycle (than with 1 single country) \n        4) Neural network (especially RNN, LSTM)\n    5. Using and evaluating forecasting models\n        1) Train / test on the data of S.Korea (APPLIED)\n        2) Train / test on the data of similar groups as S.Korea in terms of spreading phase (APPLIED - Germany)\n        3) Train / test on all countries (partly APPLIED with those with <0.1 recent_to_max ratio)\n        4) Choose (or ensemble) the best models\n        5) Refine (with (hyper)parameter tuning)\n        6) Deploy (with keeping debugging)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='updates'></a>\n# [[Major Updates]](#table)\n    1.
