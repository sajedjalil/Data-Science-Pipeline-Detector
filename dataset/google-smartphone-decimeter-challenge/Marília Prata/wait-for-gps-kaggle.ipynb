Height can be measured in two ways. The GPS uses height (h) above the reference ellipsoid that approximates the earth's surface. The traditional, orthometric height (H) is the height above an imaginary surface called the geoid, which is determined by the earth's gravity and approximated by MSL. The signed difference between the two heights—the difference between the ellipsoid and geoid—is the geoid height (N). \n\n\nThe figure bellow shows the relationships between the different models and explains the reasons why the two hardly ever match spatially.\n\nhttps://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0703/geoid1of3.html\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/mapitgis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/geoid_height_big.jpg)mapitgis.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train[train['phoneName']=='Mi8'].groupby('latDeg').count()['heightAboveWgs84EllipsoidM'].plot()\nplt.title('Mi8 Phone by Latitude Degree & Ellipsoid Height', fontsize=20)\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 10px; background: #001f3f;\"><b style=\"color:#32CD32;\">GPS is ready.
