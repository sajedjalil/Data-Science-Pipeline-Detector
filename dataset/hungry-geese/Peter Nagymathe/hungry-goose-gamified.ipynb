The game is set on a (7,11) grid, where if we go left on the left edge we reappear on the right edge aka. Donut World https://infinityplusonemath.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/asteroids-on-a-donut/. This means that whenever we take direction we need to acount for the symmetry of the world.\n\nOur player/goose can only move in 4 direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) = (NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST). This means that if we want to find things closest to our goose we should use the 1-norm/Manhattan distance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry. To effectively find distances.\n\n### Plan\nThe easiest and simplest \"smart\" goose to make is the \"greedy\" agent/goose. This just goes toward the closest reward/food without worrying about opponents or obstacles (not like we have any obstacles here).\n\nWe can easily make this agent with good reusable function for distance and direction calculation for more complicated agents later.","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile hungry_agent.py\nfrom kaggle_environments.envs.hungry_geese.hungry_geese import Observation, Configuration, Action, row_col\nimport numpy as np\n\n##Note that due to examples the x,y directions are flipped relative to normal games/apps\n##we could just flip it if needed.\ndef donut_world(x,y):\n    ##7/2 = 3.5 -> 4\n    ##11/2 = 5.5 -> 6\n    if x > 4 : x -= 4\n    if x < -4 : x += 4\n    if y > 6 : y -= 6\n    if y < -6 : y += 6\n    return (x,y)\n\ndef distance(v1, v2): ##v := (x,y)\n    dx = (v1[0]-v2[0])\n    dy = (v1[1]-v2[1])\n    dx,dy = donut_world(dx,dy)\n    return np.abs(dx) + np.abs(dy)\n\ndef find_closest(vectors, point):\n    max_d = np.Inf\n    close_point = vectors[0]   \n    for v in vectors:\n        d = distance(v, point)\n        if d < max_d:\n            max_d = d\n            close_point = v\n    return close_point, max_d\n            \n\ndef from_to(v1, v2): \n    return donut_world(v2[0]-v1[0], v2[1]-v1[1])\n\ndef vector_add(v1,v2):\n    return donut_world(v1[0]+v2[0], v1[1]+v2[1])\n\ndef vector_to_dir(vector):\n    sgn0 = np.sign(vector[0])\n    sgn1 = np.sign(vector[1])\n    #vector = (sgn0, sgn1)\n    if (sgn0 != 0) and (sgn1 != 0):\n        #we need to choose which direction we want to go in\n        return (sgn0, 0) #for simplicity choose vertical direction\n    \n    return (sgn0, sgn1)\n\nlegend2 = {\n    (1,0): \"SOUTH\",\n    (-1,0): \"NORTH\",\n    (0,1): \"EAST\",\n    (0,-1): \"WEST\"\n}\n\nprev_step = None\n\ndef agent(obs_dict, config_dict):\n    observation = Observation(obs_dict)\n    configuration = Configuration(config_dict)\n    player_index = observation.index\n    player_goose = observation.geese[player_index]\n    player_head = player_goose[0]\n    player = (px, py) = row_col(player_head, configuration.columns)\n    print(\"step = \", observation.step)\n    global legend2\n    global prev_step\n    \n    foods =[]\n    for food in observation.food:\n        foods.append(row_col(food, configuration.columns))\n    \n    ##we find the closest food\n    close_food = (0,0)\n    close_food, dist = find_closest(foods, player)\n    \n    print(f\"closest food at [{close_food[0]}, {close_food[1]}]; at distance [{dist}]\")\n    print(player)\n    print(close_food)\n    delta = from_to(player, close_food)\n    print(f\"delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    step = vector_to_dir(delta)\n    print(\"step towards \", step)\n    if (prev_step != None) and vector_add(prev_step, step) == (0,0):\n        ##we can't move inwards to our body\n        step = (step[1], step[0])\n    \n    prev_step = step\n    return legend2[step]\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next Steps (Still deterministic)\n\nWe would preferably want to make an agent/goose that knows about the world.
