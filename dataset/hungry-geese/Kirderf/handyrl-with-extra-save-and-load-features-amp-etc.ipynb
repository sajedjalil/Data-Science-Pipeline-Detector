During this time the team behind HandyRL also released more information and a presentation from a conference https://www.kaggle.com/c/hungry-geese/discussion/247266, after this reading I implemented the https://www.kaggle.com/ilialar/risk-averse-greedy-goose as opponent, I think the implementation worked, and also used V-trace. \n\nThe idea was to train both a small model, and use the Alpha Zero with a thought that more analyses could be done with approximal half the prediction time vs the standard, and also a large model with the though that more parameters would create a better RL. But started to feel the time pressure and ended both ideas to favor a longer training with a medium sized model instead, with the thought that a longer trained model is the best choice.\n\nFor the longer training I needed to save the episodes and other information and states to continue the learning, so did an extra code for the feature. Started with joblib lzma compress that saved ~50% of org size but took much more time so changed to standard npy after a while, time pressure vs diskspace.\n\nI also did some other minor changes, \n-\tAdded Mixed Precision to double the batch size.\n-\tChanged Adam to Adamp https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08217\n-\tChanged the relu to hardswish with inplace feature, based on that swish is a good replacement for relu in general and then using the faster version h-swish from https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244. After some feedback this change might not make big difference in RL. Just a bad habit changing this function from my part.\n\nI finally trained a model for 3310 epochs (not enough for the top 50 I guess), which I posted the final day.  I used 200k episodes in the saved resumed part, shifting with new episodes after 200k as in original code after max episodes is reached. More max episodes are preferable but due to testing and time pressure I used a smaller size, also wanted to try this option to use only the 200k latest.\n\nI have shared the changes and training in this notebook.\n\nAll credits to the original contributors and creators of HandyRL!
