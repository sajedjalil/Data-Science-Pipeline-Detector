Consider this notebook as a general guide on how to work with stable-baselines3 and torch to implement a custom policy network for \"hungry-geese\". Play with it and modify to your liking ;-)\n\nCheck: \n* stable-baselines3 docs: https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n* DQN paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602, https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236\n* Thanks for the example on how to use pytorch custom policy to: https://www.kaggle.com/toshikazuwatanabe/connect4-make-submission-with-stable-baselines3\n\n\n## Important note\n\nTraining this method for enough steps on kaggle's notebook environment sometimes fails on game render (if you see error 137 after a failed run means \"out of memory\", try changing replay buffer size). I think DQN needs long trainings on this environment so train on your own server for better results.\n\nEnjoy and please notify me any mistakes you detect, thanks!\n\n\n## Changelog\n* v125: Fixed bug on observation space had wrong data type after changed to [-1,1] range. Thanks to \"Mahesh Abnave\" (@maheshabnave999) for reporting it!\n* v122: Fixed bug after observation space changed to [-1,1] range. Thanks to \"Mahesh Abnave\" (@maheshabnave999) for reporting it!\n* v119:\n    * Removed negative reward for just moving, ends up turning into suicidal agent. Now reward for move is 1.1, eat is 2\n    * Added to observation cells marked with RISK (-0.5) for: dead_ends and adjacent to heads\n* v116:\n    * Changed observation to properly mark as visited previous position when agent's lenght is only one\n    * Fixed bug on previous move negative reward, it was checked against the wrong action\n* v100: fixed some bug on submission agent\n    * fixed final weight adjutment\n    * fixed main.py used old version of observation processor\n* v95: fixed bug on final agent output weights adjustment\n* v92: observation input for policy is been simplified to grid of values [0,1] see environment description for encoding\n* v90: Major bugfix, fixed missing save/load of policy network (only feature_extractor net was saved/loaded and used).\n    * Now code is simpler since you just specify layers and sizes on creation\n* v84: added observation centered on head, various bugfixes, changed 2 of the opponents to vanilla greedy agents and some other minor modifications\n* v75: FIXED HUGE BUG on environment reward that led to the agent assuming every move was rewarded, sorry for not detecting it earlier :-(\n* v59: removed -100 rewards (seemed to prevent from learning)\n* v54: added policy action weight modification based on common sense (collision is bad, same for dead ends and reduce weight of dangerous moves)\n* v46: modified reward values to\n* v41: added back opposite action rewards for opposite move\n* v40: added reward based on final ranking on game end\n* v39:\n    * KNOWN ISSUES: policy still seems to converge on training to predicting almost always the same action :-( \n    * added positive reward when surviving a game\n    * added extra -1 reward when losing\n    * removed negative reward for opposite move\n    * removed negative reward for moving away from previously nearest food (might have been eaten or be a bad move to go there)\n    * (fixed bug) removed a mistake on a negative reward \n* v37: fixed bug on negative cs_reward incorporation\n* v25: added previous n grid observations to dqp policy (n=2), total input dimensions are n-previous + 1 for current observation\n* v23: final agent now avoids performing the opposite move to the last taken\n* v21: added dropout and changed action choice on agent to probabilistic based on policy outputs\n* v17: fixes on policy training\n\n\n## Preliminary preparations\n\n* Install library\n* Save our improved training opponent to disk. Here I'm using greedy risk averse goose from: https://www.kaggle.com/victordelafuente/hungry-geese-template-class-greedy-risk-averse\n* Part of the same template class code is used, with some minor modifications, at the \"utility functions\" section\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install stable-baselines3 kaggle-environments > /dev/null
