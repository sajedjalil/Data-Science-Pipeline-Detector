Specifically, for each possible state and action, the agent learns the **expected total reward the agent would get if it took that action** (and then acted perferctly optimally afterwards). This expected total reward for a given (state, action) pair called its **Q-Value**. If the Q-value of each (state, action) pair is known, the agent can compare all the possible actions it can take from a state, and pick the one with the biggest Q-value. This works well when there's a manageable number of states, but it doesn't scale well to large (or even medium-sized) state spaces, since the algorithm has to track and learn about each (state, action) pair separately.\n\nFor Hungry Geese, we can be pretty sure that there are over $2^{77}$ states: if we only consider the possibility of each cell on the board being either occupied by a snake or not occupied, there are $2^{77}$ possible combnations. Some of those combinations might be impossible to achieve during a game with 4 snakes, but on the other hand, we haven't even started considering the locations of food *or* how those occupied spaces are connected - which snakes are occupying which spaces, where the heads are, etc. We can't keep that many states in memory, let alone learn about all of them, so we need a simplified approach.\n\nApproximate Q-learning seeks to, well, approximate the Q-value of all possible states (or at least all important ones) with a function. The input to the function is the description of a state and an action, and the output is the Q value; in other words, the function tries to approximate the answer to the question: \"**If I took this action right now, what would be the best score/reward/place I could achieve after this point in the game?**\" (this formulation can be useful when trying to decide what exactly to calculate in your function).\n\nOne simple(ish) approach to approximate Q-learning - the one I'm using in this notebook -  is to approximate the Q values through a **linear combination of important features of the space**:\n$$Q = \\sum_i{w_i F_i(s, a)}$$\n\nThe features are manually designed calculations which capture important things about the state our goose finds itself in. The \"learning\" part, then, is finding a set of weights such that the resulting Q actually approximates the real Q-value - the reward we should expect to get after taking this action.\n\nI like this kind of approach in part because of how *declarative* it is: I get to focus on describing several independent but important aspects of a game state - in essense, encoding the rules of the game and the important considerations that the agent should pay attention to. And the agent's actual behavior (ideally) emerges directly from what it learns about how these considerations affect the outcome."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Helper functions\n\nThese are mostly one-liners for getting info out of the observation data structure, to help keep subsequent code readable and less error-prone."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile -a submission.py\n\ndef my_snake(obs):\n    return obs.geese[obs.index]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile -a submission.py\n\ndef my_head(obs):\n    return my_snake(obs)[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile -a submission.py\n\ndef translate_my_head(config, obs, action):\n    return translate(position=my_head(obs), direction=action, columns=config.columns, rows=config.rows)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile -a submission.py\n\ndef step(obs):\n    # obs.step starts counting at 0; \"step number\" (for the purpose of hunger and episodeSteps) seems to start counting at 1.\n    return obs.step+1 ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile -a submission.py\n\ndef action_eats_food(config, obs, action):\n    return (translate_my_head(config, obs, action) in obs.food)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# State tracking globals\n\nThese are necessary to track important game state which is not provided as part of the Observation object.

And  I tried to make up a \"time-to-live\"(ttl) style function for capturing the effect of hunger, since the effect of colliding with things or not eating is that my final score may be smaller if I die early.\n\nIf I chose to use total length or \"time before starvation\" functions, this would not actually affect the *behavior* of an agent with the same weights - but it *would* make training the weights more volatile, since the training step is trying to find an approximation which fits the actual Q-value.\n\n\nAltogether, I'm currently using  7 Q-functions, though two of them (`is_first_step` and `one`) are entirely for the training part, and don't actually affect the decision-making at all.

Each time the agent makes a decision, we look at the outcome of that decission (the new state after everyone moves) and consider the difference between the prediction we made at step i, *before* actually taking that step, to the prediction we would make now that we know what happened immediately afterwards:\n\n$$\\text{diff}= (r_i  + \\gamma \\max(Q(s_{i+1}, a_{i+1}))) - Q(s_i, a_i)$$\n\nTo calcluate the prediction we would make now, we make the prediction for step $i+1$ (we assume we would take the *best* action at $i+1$, hence the max) and then add the actual immediate reward we got at step $i$. This makes the comparison apples-to-apples: each version is predicting total reward after step $i$. \n\nFinally, there's a $\\gamma$ factor which controls how much we care about the future rewards (looking ahead into infinity vs. trying to optimize for rewards we get immediately). There is no \"infinity\" in this game - it ends after at most 200 steps -  so I largely left the $\\gamma$ as 1, so it doesn't affect anything.\n\nThe actual learning step consists of taking this diff factor and using it to adjust each weight, in proportion with the value of the corresponding q-function. The learning can thus be thought of as gradient descent - adjusting the dimensions in the direction of the function \"slope\" to find a local minimum for diff.

It usually does for these particular settings, but I found it can be very easy to mess up and make the learning diverge, or converge to something that's not helpful.\n\nThere are a couple of things that can make approximate Q-learning weird and fidgety:\n\n1. The learned parameters affect the behavior of the agent, and the behavior of the agent in turn affects *the kinds of situations that the learning algorithm will see and learn from*. So if the learning happens to take the agent to a state where certain things always happen, or never happen, the agent will not necessarily learn the \"right\" lesson that generalizes well to the game at large.\n    - actually, it's not even always the fault of the particular learned parameters. For example, here, I'm training my agent against the default greedy agents, but these greedy agents seem to always steer away from head-on collisions. So the agent learns that `chance_to_collide` is not important - that parameter tends to stay close to whatever value I initialize it to. As soon as the agent enters \"the real world\", it starts playing against geese who also don't think avoiding head-on collisions is important. So it does a lot worse, because a huge element of chance is introduced (will I die of an unexpected head-on collision and take last place, or will the other guy swerve so I can subsequently take first place?). It's easy to see how other subtle differences in agent and/or opponent tactics can leave other \"blind spots\". \n1. The training is not actually optimizing for *getting a good score in the game*, it's optimizing for *making accurate Q-value predictions for the actions the agent might take*. Since the actual action-choosing algorithm tries to pick the *best* Q-value, generally, predicting Q-values correctly leads to also taking \"correct\" actions. But this can sometimes break because of the first point above: the actions that the agent might take are also controlled by the parameters being optimized. For example, I found it easy to accidentally train \"suicidal\" geese: the parameters tell them that they should try their best to collide with something or starve to death ASAP; and then those same parameters tell them that yep, they predicted correctly this would lead to a low score. The fact that the predictions aren't accurate for the actions the agent *didn't* take never comes up. This is why there's an option for moving randomly in the training logic - this adds a bit of an exploration layer to force the optimiztion to contend with a variety of states. But that can itself lead to weird problems, mostly I think when the gradient-descent step is too large and the agent \"jumps\" to a completely different behavior.\n\nThere are also lots of ways to compensate for these (and other) oddities. The [wikipedia article for Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) touches on some of them. My current strategy is to just, uh, skip the learning. You may have noticed that I'm not writing the new weights to the submission file. I'm just using my manual guess, and it's actually working much better than my best trained agents. This is primarily because of the head-on collision issue I described above. My manual weights make sure that the goose *usually* avoids potential head-on collisions, but the trained agents ignore this possibility. Of course, the better answer wouldd be to train them more properly (e.g. against other agents which may not swerve away). And I will, when I get around to it. \n\nBut I also think it's pretty interesting how Q-learning without the learning can be so effective. Q-not-learning, if you will. Something in between hard-coding behavior and RL. Even without the learning, my geese exhibit cool emergent behaviors which I did not hard-code, for example:\n- going in a circle to \"wait things out\" if there's too much danger around\n- surrounding an item of food but not eating it when it decides it doesn't need food *now*, but still wants to be close to it\n- Making a \"vertical wall\" and going into a circling pattern that way\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What did we learn?\n\nIt can be hard to tell what the learning is actually doing, and why it's learning certain things, so I recorded how the various parameters change throughout the learning process"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.subplots(figsize=(15,3))\nplt.plot(range(len(learned_values['diff'])), learned_values['diff'])\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Above is the `diff` value at each step of the learning process.

This increases the `hunger_ttl` parameter by 40  - the goose will now survive 40 more turns.

I'm sure there are also other new important features I'll think of along the way.\n- Optimize for winning: the learning part of Q-learning is currently optimizing for *score*, but I don't care about score. Q-learning is supposed to be good at learning about delayed rewards, so I may be able to optimize for *placement* directly? \n    - To do this effectively, I'll also need to track features about how well the *other* geese are doing, compared to me.\n- Do offline and/or off-policy learning: I can learn from the logs of other agents playing the game, and even my agents playing against real opponents. And if I'm not doing online learning, I can posssibly even find a more stable algorithm to find the best Q-value approximation, e.g. just linear regression?..\n    - While I'm doing linear regression, I might be able to verify whether the relationship between my features and the Q-value is even linear! For example, it might be worthwhile to take the log of some of the ttl and/or space-based features: having *lots* of space and having (*lots* of space + 5) should make less of a difference than having zero space vs. 5 squares' worth of space.\n- Try some of the stability/optimization tricks in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).
