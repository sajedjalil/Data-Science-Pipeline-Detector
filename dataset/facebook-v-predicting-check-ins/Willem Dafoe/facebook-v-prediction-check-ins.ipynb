Data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices, giving you a flavor of what it takes to work with real data complicated by inaccurate and noisy values. Inconsistent and erroneous location data can disrupt experience for services like Facebook Check In.\n\n## The task\n\nBuild a model that shall predict which business a user is checking into based on their location, accuracy, and timestamp. \nFor a given set of coordinates, the task is to return a ranked list of the most likely places the customers checked in. \n\n## The data sets\n\ntrain.csv, test.csv \n- row_id: id of the check-in event\n- x y: coordinates\n- accuracy: location accuracy \n- time: timestamp\n- place_id: id of the business, this is the target you are predicting\n\nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format with random predictions\n\n## Further notes\n\nIn the competition the participants were given around 30 million (simulated) check-ins on Facebook in a 10km by 10km grid. The goal is to build a model that predicts what business a user checks into based on spatial and temporal information. The difficult part is that there are around 100.000 different classes (place_id’s) so most supervised learning techniques won’t work on the entire dataset. However most classes are clustered in only certain parts of the grid so the idea is to select a sub-square within the grid and try to classify within small square. First I’ll do some exploratory data analysis in the smaller square then I’ll use a random forest algorithm for prediction and finally, I’ll analyze the results.\n\n## Approach:\n\n1.

This way, the class assignment distortion could be reduced. In addition, reducing the training data by the training examples that had a low classification confidence (high accuracy value) improved the classification further, up to an accuracy of 75 % in the training subsquare using gradient boosting.
