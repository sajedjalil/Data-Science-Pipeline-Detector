This sounds **hyper**-complicated (haha), so I want to take some time to dive deeper explain what it means.\n\n# 1. What is a Hyperparameter?\nThink about these **hyperparameters** as the *factory settings* of your machine learning model. Out of the box, you throw some data into the model and it will do its best at giving you a prediction using its standard settings. You don't initially assign these parameters any value, but you can at any point if desired. \n\n**Hyperparameter Tunning** is the process of tinkering with and modifying these settings with the goal of getting more accurate predictions out of your model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Mechanic](https://media.giphy.com/media/PqfKAMBfcqwVodnDKs/giphy.gif)\n<cite> <center> Tightening the bolts of your own ML Robot </center><cite>","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-12T01:28:18.172179Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-12T01:28:18.172679Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-12T01:28:18.918008Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-12T01:28:18.172567Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-12T01:28:18.916857Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The thing is, you don't really know what parameters will work best until you start trying different combinations.

Overfitting and Corss Validation ☯\n\nYou will usually be dealing with two sepparate datasets when you are applying your models, a training and test data set. As the names imply, you use your training data set to teach your model how to make predictions (to train it) and your test data set to evaluate how good is your model at making predictions. \n\nA common issue is that your model will be *extremelly* good at making predictions on your training data, but performs really poorly on your test data. This is known as **overfitting**. If we tune and optimize our model for our training data, it will be useless when we try to apply it to new data points. \n\nHere is where we introduce **Cross Validation**! In this notebook we will be using the most common method, <u>K-Fold</u>. \n\n## K-Fold Cross Validation\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, you usually split your data set into train and test whenever you are facing a machine learning problem. \n\n**With K-Fold CV we go a step further, we split our training data into K number of subsets (or Folds). We then itratively fit our model K number of times, training it on K-1 folds and validation on the Kth fold.**\n\nThis can be a bit confusing to a beginner like me, so here is a graphic to better explain:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![K-FoldCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/grid_search_cross_validation.png)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So each time we train the model, we use different parameter settings.

The processing time needed to do a randomized search with this magnitude of data is too long, therefore this approach doesn't seem to be the most optimal. \n\nI have done some more research and it seems like there are many things I could have done better in this approach, [here is a good forum post about it](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/270315/how-to-speed-up-hyperparameter-optimization). I will be trying some of these tips in a future analysis as well as doing some research into [Bayesian Optimization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-bayesian-optimization/)\n\n# Thank you\n\nAs many have said before, data science is a lot of trial and error to find the best solutions. Even though it can be discouraging at times, failing is a great opportunity to learn new things. This is a prime example.
