Although the idea in `@timesler`'s kernel is pretty simple and there are still many parts that need to be improved, I have chosen this as the starting point and tried to reproduce the whole process from `data preparation` to `inference`. I hope that by doing so I will have a better understanding of the data and be able to improve the whole pipeline or even create the new ones.\n\nI will use sample data to demonstrate the approach I used in this baseline.\n\n---\n## Baseline's
