In general taxi fare is calculate by\n\n$$\ny_{fare} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\cdot x_{distance} + \\theta_2 \\cdot x_{duration}\n$$\n\nwith $\\theta_0$ the starting tariff, $x_{distance}$ the distance travelled and $x_{duration}$ the duration of the trip. If we rewrite this we get an expression for the fare per distance:\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 \\cdot \\frac{x_{duration}}{ x_{distance}}\n$$\n\nLet's further assume for the shorter trips that $x_{distance} = c \\cdot x_{duration}$ with $c$ the average speed, then we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1 + \\frac{\\theta_2}{c} \\cdot \\frac{x_{duration}}{x_{duration}} = \\frac{\\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \\theta_1'\n$$\n\nwith $\\theta_1' = \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 / c$.\n\nConclusion: the fare per distance is proportional to $1/\\text{distance_mile}$.
