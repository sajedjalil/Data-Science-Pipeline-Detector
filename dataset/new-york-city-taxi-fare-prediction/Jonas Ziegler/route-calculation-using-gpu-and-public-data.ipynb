Intro\n\nIn this notebook I will show you how I used GPU acceleration to calculate the distance between pickup and dropoff by calculating the shortest route between those points using OpenStreetMap Data and a GPU.\n\nBut before I start, let me show you why this approach can be a valuable improvement to your notebook.\n\nLet's say you wanted to meet a friend in a park close to the east river. For some unknown reason you forgot the exact location and go to your usual spot, the Marsha P. Johnson State Park in Brooklyn. After you waited a few minutes, you get a call from your friend, how is waiting for you at the East River Park Field 8 in Manhattan. You apologize for your mistake and take a taxi to get to your friend. If you look at the position of both the pickup point (Marsha P. Johnson State Park) and the dropoff point (East River Park Field 8), you will see that there is no direct connection between those point. To get to the dropoff point you have to cross the east river. The nearest possible crossing would be the Williamsburg Bridge or the Queens Midtown Tunnel. Either way, the shortest route the taxi can take will definitely exceed twice the harversine distance between those points.\n\nThis is just one possible example in which the haversine distance between dropoff and pickup differs from the shortest driving distance by more than just a small margin. Since the driving distance and time between pickup and dropoff will determine the taxi fare, this example would most likely be an outlier in a scatter plot for correlation between haversine distance and fare amount. Even with a good machine learning algorithm you will have difficulties to predict the real fare amount for such a ride. \n\nSo what can you do? The simplest answer: Ask google maps. If you take a minute and do some research you will see that there actually is a API for google maps, that can be used to calculate such distances. The main problem in this case is, that google will charge you some money for using the API. In our example with somewhere around 55 Million documented taxi rides, that could amount to a little bit of money that you would have to pay. Since I'm still a student at a university with no regular income, and this is just a project that is supposed to be a replacement for an exam, I'm not willing to afford that. \n\nThe second alternative you may find, is an API from a website called openrouteservice. You can use that API to get route calculations, but in the free version you are currently limited to 2000 request per day. Even if the same pickup-dropoff-pairs occur multiple times in the given dataset, you would still have so many different pairs, that you would have to come up with some ideas to reduce the number of needed requests in order to do the task in a reasonable time. Even if you can come up with enough ideas to make that work, the calculated shortest distance will still be of by a considerable margin from the real shortest driving distance. For me, that ain't worth my time. \n\nAfter all the research I did to find a possible solution, I wondered, if there may be a way to get access to the street map and calculate the shortest route on my own. Luckily I found someone who came up with the same idea and a possible solution. He published that solution as a notebook on kaggle.com. \n\nNotebook:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/usui113yst/basic-network-analysis-tutorial\n\nThis notebook uses free accessible data from OpenStreetMap and, after some other analysis, gives an example on how to calculate the routes using NetworkX. Before I proceed, let us load the street map from New York City.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"G = ox.graph_from_place('New York City, New York, USA',simplify=True,truncate_by_edge=True,custom_filter='[\"area\"!~\"yes\"][\"highway\"~\"motorway|trunk|primary|secondary|tertiary|residential|motorway_link|trunk_link|primary_link|secondary_link|tertiary_link\"][\"highway\"!~\"service\"]')\nfig, ax = ox.plot_graph(G,figsize=(50,50))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-07T19:24:09.04414Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-07T19:24:09.044964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.251407Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-07T19:24:09.044884Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.250172Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(nx.info(G))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.254726Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.255361Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.665681Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.255313Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-07T19:26:18.6643Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see now, the street map gets visualized as a graph with nodes and edges. That visualization also leads us to the answer on how to calculate the routes. Since the street map can also be seen as a graph or network, we can use known algorithms to calculate the shortest distance by using the real distance between the nodes as edgecosts. There are several possible implementations for such a calculation like the single source shortest path implementation in NetworkX.\n\nThe problem in using osmnx and NetworkX is the lack of parallelization. For the number of routes the route calculation would take several days. But for a start lets look at how we can use the approach implemented in NetworkX to solve our problem and to see what steps we need to take to get there.\n\nThe first step is already done, we have a graph of New York City. \n\nAs a second step we need to get the IDs of the node or vertex closest to dropoff and pickup.

If a ride doesn't start or end in one of the predefined areas, it would start or end in water and I could eliminate that special ride.\nTo group the data by area I wanted to use polygons to determine which GPS Point belongs to which area. Unfortunately all implementations I could find used a slow sequential approach. Luckily, a friend of mine studied geoinformatics and recommended to use a GIS system. There are several APIs to include a GIS system into Python. The most interesting one is cuspatial, which is included in RAPIDS. It uses a GPU-accelerated solution that according to its developers has shown a significant speed-up in comparison to CPU-based implementations. For further information, check out https://medium.com/rapids-ai/acclerating-gis-data-science-with-rapids-cuspatial-and-gpus-fd012b27af0a\n\nSince we want to check 55 Million taxi rides, with 2 GPS Points each, any speed-up we can achieve is more than welcome.\n\nAfter we now know, how to check those points, we still have to find a way how to get those polygons.\n\n### Loading polygons from public available data\n\nLuckily I didn't need to create those polygons on my own. Some of those polygons can be easily downloaded using the OSMNX API. For some areas, like the State of New Jersey or Connecticut those polygons do not represent the coastline as precisely as you can see it in Google Maps. Thanks to the census, many states collect data about those areas, and it is often available publicly. Thankfully I was able to find out that most of the data, including precise polygons, is stored as ARCGIS data, that can be easily accessed via a REST API. Within some filters applied and some polygons merged I can create multiple precise polygons and save those polygons as a shapefile.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### OSMNX

The first thing is, that to use that numba kernel you need to generate a gpu array out of a cudf.Series by using *to_gpu_array()* and after the execution of the kernelfunction you need to reassign the cudf.Series with the gpu array, otherwise the changes made to the gpu array won't be saved into the cudf.Series.\nThe second thing is, that in order to execute the kernelfunction I needed to define a blocksize and a number of threads_per block. Those numbers may not work for you, so if the code does not work for you, start with those numbers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numba\nimport math\nfrom numba import cuda\n@cuda.jit\ndef calc_nearest_point(long,lat,node,distance,lenght,node_number,node_long,node_lat,node_length):\n    #node = Number of next node, \n    #distance = distance to next node, \n    #length = length of dataframes containing all points, \n    #node_length = length of dataframe containing all nodes\n    def get_distance(current_long,current_lat,current_node_long,current_node_lat): #simplified distance function\n        long_dist = abs(current_long-current_node_long)\n        lat_dist = abs(current_lat-current_node_lat)\n        distance = math.sqrt(math.pow((111000*lat_dist),2)+math.pow((long_dist*111000*math.cos(current_lat)),2))\n        return distance\n    def haversine_distance(current_long,current_lat,current_node_long,current_node_lat): #funktion to calculate the haversine distance between a node and a point.\n        R = 6372800 # this is in miles.

I hope I was able to show you why this approach might be better than a simpler distance calculation and perhaps even the Borough labels are helpful for your machine learning algorithm. Maybe you are interested in making your own improvements to that notebook. There are multiple possibilities like tracing back each path and calculating the travel time for the shortest path on your own, or maybe changing the edgeweight so it represents the dollar fare value by combining both travel_time and length of each edge. Maybe you can even use that notebook to calculate when and how often a node or edge is included in a path of a ride, so you can predict traffic jams or adjust the travel_time in accordance to the time of a day.  The possibilities are almost endless. I hope you can have some fun with that notebook and enjoyed reading it.
