This time trying to predict the New York taxi rides fares, given the pickup, dropoff locations, and some other features. We will stick with the XGBoost algorithm, which gives very good predictions for this specific data after we perform some interesting feature engineering and exploration of the dataset. Check it out!\n\nTaxicabs are, and always will be, an iconic part of New York. The history of their characteristic yellow color goes as follows: owners of cab companies painted their fleets a distinct signature color, resulting in cabs ranging from brown, white, red, and even checker ones. And some were yellow. After a few years, two big cab companies decided that yellow was the way to go, with both ultimately contributing to the tradition of yellow cabs in New York City. These companies were the Yellow Cab Company, started by John Hertz in Chicago in 1910, and the Yellow Taxicab Company, which was incorporated in New York by Albert Rockwell in 1912. More information on this can be found [here](https://untappedcities.com/2017/07/12/nyc-fun-facts-why-are-most-nyc-taxi-cabs-yellow/).\n\nMy notebook has been inspired by others on the same topic, which I enlist hereunder. My recognition to them and recommendation to take them a look:\n\n- Ravi tanwar's Data Cleaning + Eda + Modelling: https://www.kaggle.com/ravijoe/data-cleaning-eda-modelling\n\n- Jesús Ros' XGBoost'ing Taxi Fares: https://www.kaggle.com/gunbl4d3/xgboost-ing-taxi-fares\n\n- Vinod R's EDA + XGBoost For Predicting Fare Amount: https://www.kaggle.com/vinodsunny1/eda-xgboost-for-predicting-fare-amount\n\n- AlexS2020's Rapdis and XG Boost running on GPU: https://www.kaggle.com/alexs2020/rapdis-and-xg-boost-running-on-gpu\n\n- Nicapotato's Taxi Rides Time Analysis and OOF LGBM: https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/taxi-rides-time-analysis-and-oof-lgbm\n\nRemember to upvote if you really enjoyed it.

Therefore, it is vital to handle this in some way, in order to build a decent model and don't convert your computer into a toaster at the same time. Particularly we will subset the set with 7 million rows, an adequate and more than enough amount of data to get a good performance.\n\nApart from this, the data is extremely cleaned and simple in their dimensions, having only 6 features, an id column, and the dependent variable of the fare amount. These are the attributes:\n\n    pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the taxi ride started. \n    pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.\n    pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.\n    dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.\n    dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.\n    passenger_count - integer indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.
