It is gauged by the formation energy here in units of electronVolts (eV). When the formation energy is negative a material will spontaneously form. If it is positive it will cost energy to synthesize and gain energy by falling apart into other materials. A material of four elements can either transform into another quaternary material or fall apart in any combination of ternary (three elements), binary (two elements) or unary (one element) materials provided a reaction can be made where the total number of atoms remains the same before and after the reaction. The formation energy of a new material thus represents the difference in energy stored in its bonds, with respect to known materials. If the formation energy is positive, but not too high it may still exist as either a truly stable material (both methodological and numerical errors are likely) or a metastable material.
