Infrastructure built with steel is resilient to heavy stress from human and nature, and therefore the production of steel is an important process. This competition asks us to help make the production process of steel more efficient by identifying defects. \n\nIn this notebook, I will do an exploratory data analysis and visualization to get me and you familiar with the dataset for this competition. In another kernel, [ResUNet-a Baseline on TensorFlow\n](https://www.kaggle.com/ekhtiar/resunet-a-baseline-on-tensorflow), we focus on the model to predict the faults.\n\n**If you like my work please upvote this Kernel. This encourages or motivates people like me, who contributes to Kaggle on their own time with the intention to share knowledge, to continue the effort. Furthermore, if I made a mistake or can do something more, please leave a comment in the comments section to help me out.

We will use an algorithm called FP (Frequent Pattern) growth to examine which types of faults occur in pairs. You can read more about FP mining in this [medium article](https://medium.com/@ciortanmadalina/an-introduction-to-frequent-pattern-mining-research-564f239548e).

This is even more interesting as class 3 and 1 is the more frequent sample in the dataset. \n* The combination 3 and 1 is significantly less frequent than 3 and 4. However the support for them is below 10%, so I am not sure how significant this information is anyhow.\n* We really need to have to do some augmentation and increase the number of examples for class 2."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Okay guys!
