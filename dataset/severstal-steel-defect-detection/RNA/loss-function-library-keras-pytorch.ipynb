This in turn affects how they adjust their internal weights when performing backpropagation, so the choice of loss function has a direct influence on model performance.\n\nThe default choice of loss function for segmentation and other classification tasks is Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE). In situations where a particular metric, like the Dice Coefficient or Intersection over Union (IoU), is being used to judge model performance, competitors will sometimes experiment with loss functions that derive from these metrics - typically in the form `1 - f(x)` where `f(x)` is the metric in question. \n\nThese functions cannot simply be written in NumPy, as they must operate on tensors that also have gradient parameters which need to be calculated throughout the model during backpropagation. Accordingly, loss functions must be written using backend functions from the respective model library. This is less complicated than it sounds! For example in Keras, you would simply use the same familiar mathematical functions, albeit using the Keras backend imported as `K`, i.e `K.sum()`. Gradient calculation is handled automatically by the model libraries, although (at least in PyTorch) you can define this manually if you are confident in your mathematical ability and wish to make alterations of your own.\n\nWith multi-class classification or segmentation, we sometimes use loss functions that calculate the average loss for each class, rather than calculating loss from the prediction tensor as a whole. This kernel is meant as a template reference for the basic code, so all examples calculate loss on the entire tensor, but it should be trivial for you to modify it for multi-class averaging. \n\nI hope this kernel will be of use to you, and any corrections or suggestions are welcome.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport keras\nimport keras.backend as K","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dice Loss\n---\nThe Dice coefficient, or Dice-Sørensen coefficient, is a common metric for pixel segmentation that can also be modified to act as a loss function:\n\n![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a80a97215e1afc0b222e604af1b2099dc9363d3b)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#PyTorch\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, weight=None, size_average=True):\n        super(DiceLoss, self).__init__()\n\n    def forward(self, inputs, targets, smooth=1):\n        \n        #comment out if your model contains a sigmoid or equivalent activation layer\n        inputs = F.sigmoid(inputs)       \n        \n        #flatten label and prediction tensors\n        inputs = inputs.view(-1)\n        targets = targets.view(-1)\n        \n        intersection = (inputs * targets).sum()                            \n        dice = (2.*intersection + smooth)/(inputs.sum() + targets.sum() + smooth)  \n        \n        return 1 - dice","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Keras\ndef DiceLoss(targets, inputs, smooth=1e-6):\n    \n    #flatten label and prediction tensors\n    inputs = K.flatten(inputs)\n    targets = K.flatten(targets)\n    \n    intersection = K.sum(K.dot(targets, inputs))\n    dice = (2*intersection + smooth) / (K.sum(targets) + K.sum(inputs) + smooth)\n    return 1 - dice","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# BCE-Dice Loss\n---\nThis loss combines Dice loss with the standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss that is generally the default for segmentation models.

With α=β=1, Equation 2 produces Tanimoto coefficient, and setting α+β=1 produces the set of Fβ scores. Larger βs weigh recall higher than precision (by placing more emphasis on false negatives).\n\nTo summarise, this loss function is weighted by the constants 'alpha' and 'beta' that penalise false positives and false negatives respectively to a higher degree in the loss function as their value is increased. The beta constant in particular has applications in situations where models can obtain misleadingly positive performance via highly conservative prediction.

These are not rules that are set in stone; they are simply my findings and your results may vary.\n\n* Tversky and Focal-Tversky loss benefit from very low learning rates, of the order 5e-5 to 1e-4. They would not see much improvement in my kernels until around 7-10 epochs, upon which performance would improve significantly.\n\n* In general, if a loss function does not appear to be working well (or at all), experiment with modifying the learning rate before moving on to other options.\n\n* You can easily create your own loss functions by combining any of the above with Binary Cross-Entropy or any combination of other losses. Bear in mind that loss is calculated for every batch, so more complex losses will increase runtime.\n\n* Care must be taken when writing loss functions for PyTorch. If you call a function to modify the inputs that doesn't entirely use PyTorch's numerical methods, the tensor will 'detach' from the the graph that maps it back through the neural network for the purposes of backpropagation, making the loss function unusable. Discussion of this is available [here.](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/some-problems-in-custom-loss-functions-and-so-on/36618)\n\nI hope this kernel is of use to you.
