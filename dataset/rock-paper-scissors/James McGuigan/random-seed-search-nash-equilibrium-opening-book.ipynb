Hail Eris!\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium strategy for Rock Paper Scissors is to play perfectly randomly. On a long enough timeline, this a guaranteed statistical draw. For years it was said this strategy couldn't be beaten. This is only true with a mathematically pure implementation of randomness. However is the more popular method is `random.random(seed)`.\n\nThis uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm which has a period length is chosen to be a Mersenne prime. The randomness generated by the Mersenne Twister acts as a repeating number rather than a true irrational number. Within the randomness is a hidden pattern, incredibly faint but with just enough information structure to be exploitable.\n\nMost of the leaderboard have traded the Nash Equilibrium Draw for high-risk, high-reward Order. Playing on the side of Order results in winning games more quickly but only if your Order is better than their Order, which is how the leaderboard is sorted and it comes with a time limit. Playing on the side of Chaos gives a baseline strategy of an unbeatable statistical draw. All that is required is to exploit the opponents Order and use it against them. Thus is invoked the Third Law of Thermodynamics \"A system's entropy approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero.\"\n\nRandom Seed Search has a leaderboard score of 915 which is +230 points above the Nash Equilibrium PI bot and is still slowly trending upwards. \n\nIrrational numbers do however contain one fatal flaw. They are password protected. They have to be beaten before the game starts with it's author explicitly naming them in his source code. So how many irrational numbers are there? An infinite amount. This makes brute force search impossible. However human linguistics only has room for a small number of named irrational numbers. What is your favorite irrational number? Name it! Did you choose PI?\n\nThe price of being irrational is that you are forced to introduce yourself as: Pleased to meet you, won't you guess my name? Strategy is to play a fixed sequence against every opponent. The password attack is performed by playing a counter-irrational agent with the same sequence but all the numbers rotated by +1 % 3. The Anti-Pi bot can equally be countered by the Anti-Anti-PI bot, which does the same again. However my PI bot was forked 5 times (+3 upvotes) whilst the Anti-Anti-PI bots got no forks and less upvotes. Human psychology prefers not to be too irrational when it comes to selecting irrational numbers. This causes selection bias which is exploitable.\n\nThus the choice of irrational number can be used both as an attack and as a secret secure password. \n\nAnti-Pi bot scores [ 824 803 711 668 685 ] vs [ 685 ] for my original Pi bot. There are two effects to be seen here. First is that three of the scores [ 668 662 685 ] are within 23 points of each other. This is the Nash Equilibrium draw point for this game with exactly equal wins and losses. The Mersenne Twister RNG Bot scores [ 761 ] which is in the middle of the Anti-PI bot distribution. The other two Anti-Pi bots scores are [ 824 803 711 ] in a slightly higher range. 5 people forked my notebook (yet only 3 gave upvotes). The Anti-Pi bot is thus a password attack on an irrational agent. The Anti-Anti-PI bot scored [ 711 662 ]. which correlates within 21 of the 685 Pi-Bot Nash Equlibrium centerpoint.  Nobody forked the Anti-Pi or Anti-Anti-Pi bots.\n\nPI can be transformed into base 3 by `list(map( lambda c: int(c) % 3, re.sub( '[^1-9]', '', str(math.pi) )))`. but in practice requires `import mpmath; mpmath.1234; mpmath.p()` to generate a string long enough to satisfy a thousand move game.\n\nThe Random Seed Search algorithm takes the default RNG `random.random(seed)`, \nand generates RNG sequences (length 20) for as many seeds as can fit in the \n100Mb submission filesize limit. This happens to be 20 million seeds. \nNumpy.size = `(20,000,000, 20) x int8` = 425.0 MB = 94Mb tar.gz. \nCompression offers a ~4.5x space saving, \nmostly due to the first 6 bits in every int8 being zero for trinary numbers. \n\nPre-caching costs 27 minutes of compile time. \nBy careful use of excluding previously rejected seeds, \nwe can search this array very quickly and even implement \noffset search for the opponents history without the 1s timelimit. \nEach turn we can reduce the remaining search space by a factor of 3. \nThis is compared to the previous implemention which could \nonly search about ~10,000 seeds per turn using a python loop.\n\nIf a seed is found, the next number in the sequence can be predicted \nwithout violating apparent randomness. \nThis effectively acts as an opening book against Mersenne Twister RNG agents. \nWhat is observed in practice is the Random Seed Search is only occasionally able to \nfind a small sequences numbers, often during the other agent's random warmup period. \nI have not yet seen a +500 score against an unseeded random agent. \nI suspect these partial matching sequences represent hash collisions \nof repeating sequences within the Mersenne Twister number. \n\nAs the history gets longer, hash collisions become exponentially rarer. \nThis is the game-winning difference between using a repeating number and irrational number \nfor your source of randomness. \nThe effect is quite small, but the 50% standard deviation for a random draw \nis in this game is only 20. A statistical 2-3 point advantage shifts \nthe probability distribution of endgame score, a -21 score gets converted into a draw \nand a +19 score gets converted into a win. \n\nThis is equivalent to the statistical effect that causes \nBlack Holes to slowly lose mass via Hawking Radiation.\n\nThe leaderboard rewards winning points quickly, but the only way to become champion is to never statistically lose. Order can be indeed be beaten at its own game.\n\n(Hopefully) Achievement Unlocked: Beat the unbeatable Nash Equilibrium RNG bot!\n\nTODO: verify the statistics and make sure this actually works in practice. However this is still a really cool idea and implemention."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Opponents\n\nWe have two classes of opponent that we are attempting to counter.\n\nThe first is a random agent that has explictly set a numeric seed smaller than 17 million. Against this agent, we can a near perfect score, however it may take a few turns to establish a pattern match.\n\nThe second agent is the unseeded random agent. Behind the scenes `random.seed(None)` gets its seed value from `urandom` which means we are unlikely to find the exact seed on our list. What we are left with are hash collisions, which are a byproduct of the Mersenne Twiser algorithm that uses a repeating number (with a Mersenne Prime period) rather than the pure unbreakable randomness of an Irrational number. The logs show that occasionally we will get a sequence of 3-8 numbers in a row that follow one of the seed patterns found in the cache. This usually only happens within the first 15 opening moves of the game, but this gives us a small but significant statistical advantage over the Nash Equlibrium strategy.

To upload an agent with multiple files, submit your work as a .tar.gz archive (the name must end in .tar.gz) with a python file at the top level called main.py that conforms to the normal agent submission requirements. The maximum upload size of 100MB applies to the full archive. For the initial release of this feature we only compile the main.py file so to import other python files you'll either have to compile/exec or importlib the relevant files.
