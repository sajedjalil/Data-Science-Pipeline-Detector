So far, none of these ideas have proved consistanly successful and/or legal, but I'll keep searching. I just hope that this opens up new ways to try and exploit random number generators and take back the leaderboard!\n\n\nSome things to think about:\n* By default, the seed for the random library if not specified uses the current system time (`time.time()`). If you can estimate when the opponent sent their move, you can try and guess their seed.\n* Some other algorithms have been made to try and solve the Mersenne Twister, and a resource can be found [here](https://jazzy.id.au/2010/09/22/cracking_random_number_generators_part_3.html).\n* Random bots can easily bypass all this by resetting their seed to a different value each time, so most of this is probably overkill for something that is easily avoidable\n\nSuggestions and feedback is welcome!
