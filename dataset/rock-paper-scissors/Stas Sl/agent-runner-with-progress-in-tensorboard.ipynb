{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we have only limited number of matches played per day, we might want to evaluate our agents faster locally. There were notebooks where agents played one with another, thus number of games was $O(N^2)$. But as number of agents grows, it becomes quite long to wait. \n\nSo here I decided to implement something similar to the official matchmaking and scoring. I don't know exactly how scores are calculated, but I used *TrueSkill* ratings (there is really good introduction to it and python package http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html), based on this description I believe it might be quite similar to what used in the official competition. \n\nFor comparison I added simple **win_rate** progress. You can see, that while ratings are quite noisy even after 1000 games, **win_rate** converges much beter. I didn't implement all nuances of current matchmaking and scoring, so in reality it might be different, but what we observe so far, it is noisy indeed. \n\nIf you have ideas how to make scoring closer to the official implementaion or how to enhance it, please let me know :)\n\n**UPD:**\nI have found that setting TrueSkill _tau_ parameter to 1/1000 of _sigma_ instead of recommended 1/100 produces much smoother results. So after enough games the scores are quite well separated and win_rate and more sophisticated rating calculations look pretty similar. The problem is that our agents play only about 5-6 episodes a day or 150-200 a month and that might be not enough, especially for agents submitted at a later time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/guoZA8x.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport random\n\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count, set_start_method\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\nfrom trueskill import Rating, TrueSkill, rate_1vs1\nfrom tensorboardX import SummaryWriter\nfrom scipy.special import comb\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Some constants"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ROUNDS = 1000\nMATCHES_PER_BOT = 10              #
