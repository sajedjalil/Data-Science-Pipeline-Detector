The first problem anyone using this approach encounters is that once a strategy accumulates a high win count, the opponent might start to target that strategy, and it will take some time before the win count declines enough to reorient the agent properly.\n\nOne approach (not my strongest approach, but a strong one) was to use multiple rolling windows for counting.  In the code, I refer to \"weight schemes,\" which are collections of rolling windows that use a weighted average to return a score.  Since we can think of a \"strategy\" as an action-selection and a record of hits and misses, we can use weight schemes to convert a collection of strategies into a new collection of strategies (the diagram below is intended to show how).\n\nWhen we layer this technique upon itself, the agent seems to be better equipped to evade detection, and to dynamically target different unique opponent strategies. But it is also prone to more random fluctuation, which  can lead to sporadically losing matches. \n\nToday, near the end of this competition, the strongest variation of this strategy sits at 1016, or about 14th place (silver).\n\n(Write-up and public notebook for my strongest agent are coming soon.  Since this is quite different from my strongest, I figured I'd make it public as well.)\n\n![diagram](https://i.imgur.com/MMLu3zN.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile submission.py\n\nimport os\nimport secrets\n\nNUM_SCHEMES = 6\nNUM_SCHEMES_FOLLOWUP = 6 \nNUM_SCHEMES_FINAL = 4\n\nmy_last_action = None\ntoken_list = []\ntally = 0\nlog = ''\nact_highest = -1\nact_total = -1\nact_highest_record = []\nact_total_record = []\nbeats = [1, 2, 0]\nframe = 0\nrecords = []\nwins = []\nlast_guesses = []\n\ndef randomPlay():\n    return secrets.randbelow(3)\n\n#####\n# Counts values in a series with a rolling window of some length, returning a \n# distribution of value-counts from that period\n#####\nclass RollingCounter:\n    def __init__(self, length):\n        self.length = length\n        self.items = []\n        self.totals = [0, 0, 0]\n        self.currIndex = 0\n        self.cutoffIndex = self.length * -1\n\n    def count(self, val):\n        self.items.append(val)\n        self.totals[val] += 1\n        if self.cutoffIndex > 0:\n            self.totals[self.items[self.cutoffIndex]] -= 1\n        self.cutoffIndex += 1\n\n    def getDist(self):\n        return self.totals\n\n#####\n# Counts values in a series with several rolling windows, returning a weighted \n# sum of these distributions\n#####\nclass GangCounter:\n    def __init__(self, lengthList):\n        self.lengthList = lengthList\n        self.lengthDict = {}\n        self.counters = []\n        for i, length in enumerate(lengthList):\n            counter = RollingCounter(length)\n            self.counters.append(counter)\n            self.lengthDict[length] = counter\n\n    def setWeightList(self, weights):\n        self.weightList = weights\n\n    def count(self, val):\n        for counter in self.counters:\n            counter.count(val)\n\n    def getDist(self, length):\n        counter = self.counters[self.lengthList.index(length)]\n        return counter.getDist()\n\n    def getDists(self):\n        allDists = []\n        for length in self.lengthList:\n            dist = self.getDist(length)\n            allDists.append(dist)\n        return allDists\n\n    def getWeightedVal(self):\n        outputVal = 0.0\n        totalWeight = 0\n        for i, length in enumerate(self.lengthList):\n            dist = self.getDist(length)\n            if not dist[0] + dist[1] == 0:\n                outputVal += (dist[1] / (dist[0] + dist[1])) * self.weightList[i]\n                totalWeight += self.weightList[i]\n        if totalWeight == 0:\n            return 0\n        return outputVal / totalWeight\n\n#####\n# Holds a collection of GangCounters that each return a weighted distribution \n# of value-counts from a series.\n#####\nclass CompoundGangCounter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.counters = []\n\n    def addWeights(self, lengthList, weightList):\n        counter = GangCounter(lengthList)\n        counter.setWeightList(weightList)\n        self.counters.append(counter)\n\n        \n    ####\n    #
