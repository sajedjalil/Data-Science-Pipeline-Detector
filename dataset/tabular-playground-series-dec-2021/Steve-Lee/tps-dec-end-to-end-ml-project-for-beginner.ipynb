Because Kaggle tell us everything! :)\n\n\n> The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition\n\n> For this competition, you will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the Forest Cover Type Prediction. This dataset is (a) much larger, and (b) may or may not have the same relationship to the target as the original data.\n\nAnd we must frame the problem.<br>\n\n*is supervised-learning?<br>\nis unsupervised-learning?<br>\nis regression?<br>\nis reinforcement learning?<br>\nis batch inference?<br>\nis online inference?<br>*\n\nKaggle Tell us that this competition is Supervised Learning especially Classification!<br>\n(will be predicting the <code>Cover_Type</code> for each row in this file (the target integer class))<br>\nThen we Frame the Problem like this\n\n## Frame the Problem\n* play Kaggle with Fun\n* predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data\n\n## Select evaluation metrics\n> Submissions are evaluated on multi-class classification accuracy.\n\nHow kind you are :)\n\n\nBecause we are beginner, our problem is 'how enjoy the Kaggle'. looool!!!\n\n*(If you guys want to more about evaluation. please refere here [[Model Evaluation] 1.
