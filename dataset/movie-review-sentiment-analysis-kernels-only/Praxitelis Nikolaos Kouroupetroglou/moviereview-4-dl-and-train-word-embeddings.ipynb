The dataset of this competition turned to have some unique features. we have only phrases as data. And a phrase can contain a single word. And one punctuation mark can cause phrase to receive a different sentiment. Also assigned sentiments can be strange. This means several things:\n\n- using stopwords can be a bad idea, especially when phrases contain one single stopword;\n- puntuation could be important, so it should be used;\n\n** This thought will be enhanced later with my anomaly detection insights **\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe395593fecc2ef67372c253edccbb3e7f0f5554"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading Main Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport nltk","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"53fa1aabc021b4119311659e913bee04736bcb4f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preview"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.tsv\", sep=\"\\t\")\n\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(\"../input/test.tsv\", sep=\"\\t\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"377968fad9e3f1a90c312fd1663a2b67da2af60e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2eb942b02879f1e44e6900fdba0612359c4d6995"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"78bb7e9b4efc0cb982fea4de93b3152b42ec5464"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Thoughts before training DL models\nHere are couple of instances where punctuations appeared to be predictive.

They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work. They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.\n\nLSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!\n\nAll recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer.\n\nLSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure. Instead of having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way [source](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n\nThe following function builds a DL sequential network. The layers are the following:\n- The Embedding Layers where word embeddings are trained which reduces the one-hot-encoding phrases vectors to a dense with size of 300\n- A dropout Layers where with regularize the connection between the embedding layer and the following LSTM layer\n- Then the LSTM layer with number of cells equal to 150\n- A dropout Layers where with regularize the connection between the the LSTM layer and the following 5 dense neurons\n- Finally the last layer is 5 neurons equal to the number of sentiment classes\n\nAs optimizer we use the *nadam* and the fitting goal is to maximize the model's accuracy, hence we use a checkpointer Keras function for that to save the best model.

Sometimes, you might have to learn representations from future time steps to better understand the context and eliminate ambiguity.

In the above two sentences, when we are looking at the word “Teddy” and the previous two words “He said”, we might not be able to understand if the sentence refers to the President or Teddy bears.
