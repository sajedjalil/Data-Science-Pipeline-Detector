Furthermore the goal of the EDA was to uncover potential variables which could potentially alter the predictions we made based on the dataset. After the completion of the EDA, we used what we learned about the data to make predictions about the sales trends by using various predictions models such as SARIMAX.\n\nSo what are we trying to predict? The goal of the challenge is to predict sales data for a period of 28 days for Wallmart. This can be achieved since we've been given three different data sets, which describes the sales trends for the past 5 years. The data consists of 3049 individual products from the three different categories foods, household and hobbies. The products comes from 10 different stores across 3 different states. The data contains sales data for all these product for a period of 1942 days, which rougly adds up to 5 years.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the datasets we've been handed;\n\n* `sales_train.csv` This is our main training data. It contains columns over the days in the dataset and the amount of sales made of a given product for each specific day. This dataset also gives us other various information about each specific product such as `state_id`, `store_id`, `department_id`, `category_id` and `item_id`.\n* `sell_prices.csv` Contains a list of the stores and item ID's together with the sales prices of the item as a weekly average.\n* `calender.csv` This dataset contains a list of all the dates we're working with. This dataset also contains information about events such as the superbowl, christmas etc. which predictably alters the sales trend for certain periods. This helps us make better educated guesses as to why the data behaves as it does, and it also gives us information about predictable fluctuations in sales trends. The calendar dataset also gives us information about [SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) and SNAP days. This is relevant as days where the stamps are eligible for use in the stores, potentially can alter sales trends. This will be researched in greater length during the EDA. \n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At the start of the project we conducted an exploratory data analysis.
