With W being an items level 12 weight, W/sqrt(scaling factor) never worked well. Using 1/(scaling factor) as a weight gave reasonable results, but scored worse than tweedie about half the time, and sometimes it lost really bad, so it was looking like tweedie was going to be my objective function. But I had spent tens if not hundreds of hours working on a custom loss function that paid respect to the WRMSSE across all levels, so I decided to give it one more think. I thought,\n### \"if the answer was really simple and elegant, what would it be?\"\nSo no fancy aggregations during training, and no gradients that would tell my predictions to go the wronge direction to compensate for other wrong predictions in service to higher levels. I just wanted a proper weight for each item to add to my RMSE function that would would reflect the items contribution to the full WRMSSE score. \n\n### For a given item how does an error affect the total score?\nWe know that part of the penalty comes from each of the twelve hierarchical levels. From level 12, we know for sure that the penalty will be $\\frac{W_{12}}{\\sqrt{S_{12}}}$ multiplied by our error (I guess its actually more complicated than this because the error is actually the square root of the average of squared errors across time, but for simplicities sake, I continue my thinking like this). For the other levels, it appears to be more complicated, given that an error for this item could balance out another items error, but if we assume all other items are correct, then the error is simply $\\frac{W_{L}}{\\sqrt{S_{L}}}$, where W and S are the weight and scaling factor of the series on level L to which the particular item belongs. Therefore, I decided to try the simple formula \n$$\nW_{item} = \\sum_{L=1}^{12}\\frac{W_{L}}{\\sqrt{S_{L}}}\n$$\n\nNow I take a simple RMSE function and weight each item with these weights. It turns out this loss function performed better than any other loss functions I had, including tweedie, but it did need the right early stopping function. \n\n### Early stopping metric\nI tried various early stopping metrics, including the proper WRMSSE, level 12 RMSSE, level 12 'out of stock ' adjusted RMSSE, and a level 12 WRMSSE with the weights computed as they are in my loss function. Interestingly, the metric I created using the same idea as the loss function consistently performed worse as an early stopping metric, compared to both the oos_RMSSE and the WRMSSE. In the end, using the oos_RMSSE gave the best results as an early stopper. \n\nBelow is code that starts with a dataframe with weights and scales for all series, and yields a dataframe with the proper sum of weights and scales for each level 12 item.
