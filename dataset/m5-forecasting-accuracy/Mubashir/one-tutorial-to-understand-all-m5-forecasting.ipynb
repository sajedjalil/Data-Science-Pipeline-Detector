The sales dataset contains the information across some 30,000 different items along almost 1900 days. The distriubtion of the data has been divided around and covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) including item level, department, product categories, and store level details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset wouldn't only be helpful in improving forecasting accuracy but could also help expose the underlying patterns of sales observed through different locales as well as against a range of different product categories providing valuable business insights.\n\nOwing to the fact that a large dataset has been made available. We'd start off with a business formulation devised around a few problems. Whether the dataset would be enough to answer those questions would be determined by the dataset available. Should the answers not be found by the dataset, atleast necessary information regarding collection of a few datapoints would certainly help improve the future data design. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Problem Statement?:**\n\nA large dateset makes it difficult to find all the underlying patterns present in the dataset. Fortunately, devising a few questions of SMART nature (SMART standing for specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) are helpful in understanding patterns that could otherwise, might have been invisible with an all-in headfirst diving appraoch into the dataset. \n\nIn the specific probelm of m5-forecasting, we'd concern ourselves in finding out:\n\n- What is the general distribution of the sales_items(ids) across categories?\n- What is the behavior of categories across different stores?\n- What specific item id is outselling the most? \n- What is the specific id of item in each category that has most sales?\n- What is the most sales revenue collected? Is the item id that is outselling the most brings in the most revenue or is there variation along those trends?\n- What is the behavior of total sales (or mean sales) across time\n- What is the behavior of item_ids selling across different weekdays? Are there any specfic dates of the month when there are most sales?How does this trend change across different stores?\n\nAnd finally, we would be using SARIMAX and facebook developed Prophet Model to forecast the sales made in the next 28 days. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Evluation Metrics:\n\nThis project uses quite a few error metrics that have been used to either optimise and fine tune the model or to find the prediction accuracy for the forecast made using time series. Given the situation of the time series forecast that we are gong to make, there are following error metrics used. \n\n1. **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** - In order to evaluate the sales forecasts made using SARIMAX, RMSE error metric was used. The Time series used in this case, took the average number of sales made, along the course of almost 1900 days, dsregarding the original heirarchical data arragement of product ids alongside several other levels. The utitlity of the error metrc RMSE is not invalidated since, we are considerng the average number of sales made, thereby nullyfying the effect of lots of zeroes for a lot of product ids, alongside only the number of days. \n\n2. **Custom Loss (WMAPE)**: The error metric Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error was used to evaluate and find the optimal parameters for the Facebook Designed Prophet Model. The WMAPE error is used for those instances where the priority of each product id is considered alongside the number of sales made. The weighted coefficients were calculated by dividing the difference between the forecast and the actual sales values by their mean value. \n\n3. **WRMSSE (Weighted Root Mean Square Scaled Error)** : In order to evaluate the efficiency of the model designed, the WRMSSE score was calculated once the prediction ready dataframe (forecast of almost 30,000 product ids) was ready. This was necesary because the WRMSSE score calculated required that the total entries of all product ids (almost around 30,000 products) be used and then a difference between the values of the validation dataset i.e. sales_train_validation.csv and the forecasted dataframe was taken. This WRMSSE error metric is the one that is provided by the competition and has been optimised to be used for the current competition. I order to evaluate it, we would have to use the whole dataset of sales_train_validation.csv that has been provided in single csv file.

This test provides us with a test statistic as well as confidence intervals for the critical values. The objective is to determine whether the test statistic is less than the critical value, if it is we can **reject** the null hypothesis. The assumption of null and alternative hypotheses in this test is as follows:\n\n* Null Hypothesis: The time series has some time component, and has a unit root suggesting a highly dependent time orientation indicating the presence of non-stationarity.\n* Alternative Hypothesis: The time series does not have a unit root, indicating that it does NOT have a time dependent structure and consequently the time series is stationary.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_sales_cal_df = train_sales_df.set_index('id')[d_cols].T.merge(calendar_df.set_index('d')['date'], \n                                                                    left_index=True, right_index=True,\n                                                                    validate=\"1:1\")\ntrain_sales_cal_df['avg_sales'] = train_sales_cal_df.mean(axis=1)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-29T13:40:10.521553Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-29T13:40:10.521836Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.35282Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-29T13:40:10.521792Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.351413Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##train_sales_cal_df = train_sales_cal_df[['total_sales']]\n##train_sales_cal_df = train_sales_cal_df.reset_index()\n##train_sales_cal_df = train_sales_cal_df.set_index('date')\n\ntrain_sales_cal_df = train_sales_cal_df.reset_index()\ntrain_sales_cal_df.rename(columns={'index': 'daysnum'}, inplace=True)\ntrain_sales_cal_df = train_sales_cal_df.set_index('date').asfreq('d')\ntrain_sales_cal_df.head(2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.354154Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.354792Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_sales_cal_df.index = pd.to_datetime(train_sales_cal_df.index)\ntype(train_sales_cal_df.index)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.356053Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-29T13:40:25.356498Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def time_series_stationary_test(df):\n    \n    '''\n    returns time_series plots along with rolling mean plot, standard_dev calculated plot\n    and results of the Dickey_Fuller Test performed on time_series df\n    \n    inputs: df (time_series based df)\n    \n    returns : time_series plot, rolling_mean plot, std_plot and Dickey_Fuller Test Statistics\n              performed on time_series\n    '''\n    #df_filter = df.loc[df['id'] == series_ids][d_cols]\n    #df_filter = df.loc[df['id'] == series_ids]['sold']\n    #df_filter = pd.Series(df_filter.values.flatten())\n    \n    sns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(15, 5))\n    \n    rolling_mean = df.rolling(window=7).mean()\n    rolling_std =  df.rolling(window=7).std()\n    \n    #plotting the points\n    original_series = df.plot(figsize=(15, 5), alpha=1, \n                        lw=1.2, color=next(color_cycle), label='original_series', ax=ax1)\n    mean_series = rolling_mean.plot(figsize=(15, 5), alpha=1, \n                        lw=1.2, marker = 'o', color=next(color_cycle), label='rolling_mean', ax=ax1)\n    std_series = rolling_std.plot(figsize=(15, 5), alpha=1, \n                        lw=1.2, marker = '*' , color=next(color_cycle), label='rolling_std', ax=ax1)\n    \n    ax1.legend(['Original_Series', 'Mean_Series', \"Std_Series\"])\n    plt.show()\n    \n    #Performing a Dickey-Fuller Test\n    print(\"\\n============++++==========\\n\")\n    print(\"Results of the Dickey_Fuller Test\")\n    result = adfuller(df, autolag='AIC')\n    print('ADF Statistic: %f' % result[0])\n    print('No of lags: %f' %result[2])\n    print('No of Obs used for ADF Calculation & Critical Values: %f' %result[3])\n    print('p-value: %f' % result[1])\n    print('Critical Values:')\n    for key, value in result[4].items():\n        print('\\t%s: %.3f' % (key, value))\n    #output = pd.Series(result[0:4], index=['ADF Statistic','p-value','#Lags Used','Number of Observations Used'])\n    #for key,value in result[4].items():\n    #

The prediction on the arima model is determined by its 'Trend' parameters p,d and q. They represent:\n\n* Number of AR (auto-regressive) terms (p) : AR terms are just lags of the dependent variable. e.g. if p is 2, the predictors for x(t) will be x(t-1), x(t-2) OR AR terms view the value at one time as a weighted sum of past values.\n* Number of MA (moving averages) terms (q) : MA terms are lagged forecast errors e(i) in prediction equation where e(i) is the difference between the moving avg at ith term vs the actual value. For q = 2, the predictors for x(t) will be e(t-1), e(t-2).\n* Number of differences (d) : These are the number of non-seasonal differences. \n\nThe SARIMAX adds other seasonal components to handle the seasonality with P, D, Q and m represpresenting the seasonal 'Auto-regressive' 'Differencing' and 'Moving-Average' Orders with m representing the number of time steps that are observing the seasonal behaviour. \n\nThe equation for SARIMAX is given as SARIMAX (p, d, q) = (P, D, Q, S)\n\nTo find out the appropriate values for p and q, we generally employ ACF (auto-correlation function) and PCF (Partial-correlation function). \n\n* **ACF** - AutoCorrelationFunction: It is the measure of the correlation of a time series against lagged version of itself. e.g. with a lag of 3, ACF would compare the time instances t1, t2 with t1-3, t2-3\n* **PCF** - PartialCorrelationFunction: It is a measure of correlation of a time series against a lagged version of itself but after removing the already calculated variations. e.g. with a lag of 4, PCF would check the correlation of against the lagged version but after removing the effects explained by lag1 to lag3

model along with a general moving average prediction for rest of the ids not predicted using prophet model were used to make forecast for the next 28 days. However, the accuracy score from kaggle private leaderboard has come out to be around 0.73. There are a few other kernels that have described ways to improve this further\n\nPlease Feel Free to Improve Upon this notebook and give your feedback\n\n- Run the model of prophet forecast for atleast 1/3rd of the all product ids to explore its potential of improving the forecast , using a fast machine.\n- Use another model implementation such as LightGBM, Convolution NN to improve the score\n- Make new features with rolling mean as well as a lag feature that have been observed to improve score when using models such as lightgbm","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References and Further Readings:\n\nQuite a few resources proved helpful while others that offered more opportunity for learning are mentioned below\n\n- https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_sarimax_stata.html\n- https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/arima-model-time-series-forecasting-python/\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-forecasting-a-getting-started-guide-c435f9fa2216\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/an-end-to-end-project-on-time-series-analysis-and-forecasting-with-python-4835e6bf050b\n- https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/diagnostics.html\n- https://www.baeldung.com/cs/mape-vs-wape-vs-wmape\n- https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/144067\n- Special thanks to the kernel of TSURU https://www.kaggle.com/girmdshinsei/for-japanese-beginner-with-wrmsse-in-lgbm#WRMSSE-calculation\n- Specal thanks to the kernel of sibmike for making WRMSSE calculation faster https://www.kaggle.com/mubashir1/fast-clear-wrmsse-18ms/edit\n- https://www.kaggle.com/binhlc/forecasting-multiple-time-series-using-prophet\n- https://www.kaggle.com/tnmasui/m5-wrmsse-evaluation-dashboard","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**=============++++++================**","metadata":{}}]}
