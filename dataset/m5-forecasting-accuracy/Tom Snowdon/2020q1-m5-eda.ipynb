The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.\n\n*Note that this is the **point estimate** competition (there is also a complementary competition running which is concerned with predicting the uncertainty distribution).*\n\n### Evaluation\nThis competition uses a Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE):\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uqhsf3d.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B1hglCf.png)\n\n### Submission\nEach row contains an id that is a concatenation of an item_id and a store_id, which is either validation (corresponding to the Public leaderboard), or evaluation (corresponding to the Private leaderboard). You are predicting 28 forecast days (F1-F28) of items sold for each row. For the validation rows, this corresponds to d_1914 - d_1941, and for the evaluation rows, this corresponds to d_1942 - d_1969. (Note: a month before the competition close, the ground truth for the validation rows will be provided.)\n\n# Understanding the Data\n\nThe data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details split as follows:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C5hASXe.png)\n\nLet's take a deeper dive!\n\n# Exploratory Analysis\n\n## Setup"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport scipy\nimport os\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# read in data provided by kaggle for the competition\nsource_filesinfolder = os.listdir('../input/m5-forecasting-accuracy')\nsource_filenames = [file.replace('.csv', '') for file in source_filesinfolder]\nsource_data_path = '/kaggle/input/m5-forecasting-accuracy'\nfor file in source_filenames:\n    globals()[file] = pd.read_csv(f'{source_data_path}/{file}.csv')   ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Quick Peek at the Datasets"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(source_filenames)\nfor file in source_filenames:\n    print(globals()[file])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# High level price and sale info\n\nWe've got over 3k items, so can't easily look at each individually, but let's look at some high level info on sales, prices within categories, and prices across time & stores.\n\nWe'll calculate some item level summaries\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get a dataset with info on each item\nitem_info = sales_train_validation[[\"dept_id\",\"cat_id\",\"item_id\"]].drop_duplicates()\n\n# Join category onto sell_prices\nsell_prices_for_eda = (\n    sell_prices\n    .merge(\n        item_info\n        , how = \"left\"\n        , on = \"item_id\"\n    )\n)\n\n# Summarise by item & store\nitem_store_summaries = (\n    sell_prices_for_eda\n    .groupby(['item_id', 'store_id' ,'dept_id', 'cat_id'])['sell_price']\n    .agg(\n        price_mode = lambda x: stats.mode(x)[0][0]\n        , price_mean = 'mean'\n        , price_min = 'min'\n        , price_max = 'max'\n        , price_sd = np.std\n        , price_sum = 'sum'\n        , price_size = 'size'\n    )\n    .reset_index()\n    .assign(max_discount_from_peak = lambda x: 1 -
