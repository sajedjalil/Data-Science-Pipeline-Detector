I used [Deep Learning Studio](http://deepcognition.ai), a drag and drop GUI based platform to build and train neural networks.\nThis tool cuts down a significant amount of time to try different DNN architectures without spending a lot of time in programming. They are providing few free GPU hours on your first login."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e7ba5dc5-8f70-abc1-cf97-a1a259a526cd"},"source":"### Step 1:\nSign up and get access to Deep Learning Studio at http://deepcognition.ai\n\n### Step 2:\nEnable the  cached dataset for this competition by following these steps:\n\n1) click on 'Datasets' from the left side navigation panel\n\n2) click on 'Cached datasets' column on datasets page\n\n3) select the 'The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring\" dataset on this page\n\n4) Download 'train.zip' from Kaggle upload it, to verify that you have accepted the rules of the competition. The dataset will be added to your datasets after verification.\n\n![enable cached dataset][1]\n\n### Step 3:\nCreate New Project and open it.\n\n![New Project Creation][2]\n\nSet Data pre-processing options.\n\n1) I used train/validation/test split as (80%-10%-10%) [any other combination works equally good]\n\n2) Selected image data type for image column, categorical for output column and assigned input0/output0 ports respectively\n\n3) Resizing all images to 192*192 and set data normalization to true on image data\n\n![data set options][3]\n\nBuild the model by dragging and dropping the layers from the left side panel on the model tab. The layer parameters can be set from the right side panel when that layer is selected.\n\n![model with inception_v3][4]\n\nNow set the hyperparameters required to run the training.\n\n![hyper parameters][5]\n\n### Step 4:\nStart training and monitor the loss and accuracy graphs. You can tweak the model based on what you observe on this screen. Let the training complete, or stop it early if you find it overfitting.\n\n![training dashboard][6]\n\n### Step 5:\nClick on the inference tab.
