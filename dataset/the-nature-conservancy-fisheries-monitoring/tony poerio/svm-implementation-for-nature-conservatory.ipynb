Why use an SVM?\n\n - Excellent way to learn and understand the problem\n - Better results than you'd expect\n - Great way to learn how to use the SVM library in SKLearn (that's why I did it)\n - Will learn some handy tricks in opencv (especially regarding feature extraction), along the way\n\nPersonally, I think the CNN's (when well optimized) will perform better, but there's a lot to learn from this process. Particularly with regard to feature extraction. One thing I'm wondering is whether we could gain performance improvements by feeding extracted features to our CNNs instead of the raw image. Something to experiment with and explore."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aebccdff-feb1-55bb-d9ec-ff117d7460bf"},"source":"## Overview of the process\nThe process for using an SVM for this problem is a little different than using a ConvNet.\n\nMost importantly, we will need to extract features from the imagery ourselves, rather than letting the CNN do it. So we get to pull back the curtain a bit, and see what's happening behind the scenes (if you'll forgive the metaphor).\n\n**The Steps We'll Take**\n - Load Data\n - Extract Features\n - Feed Features into SVM Model\n - Fit the SVM\n - Predict with our SVM\n\nFrom there, we can iterate and improve the model. Just as with ConvNets, if we send better data into the model, we will get better results.

You'll need to run code for this on your computer. It yields an Nx128 set of features, each extracted from detected keypoints in the image. The problem with SIFT, however, is that it is NOT open source. So, technically you need to pay royalties to its inventors in commercial applications.\n 2. **ORB** - OpenCV's open source alternative to SIFT. I have code for using ORB in the section below, as well. But the code may need to be restructured from Nx128 to NxM, depending on how many dimensions ORB gives you back for each feature.  More on ORB: http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/orb_final.pdf \n 3. **HoG (Histogram of Gradients)** - Another good option, this often used to find both people and animals in photos. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients \n\nThe point here is: once features are extracted, we have essentially taken the the \"most important\" or \"distinctive\" keypoints from each image and mapped them into a higher dimensional space via our feature extraction method.\n\nWe then feed our higher dimensional information vector into the SVM, along with a label, and we train the SVM on these data in our high-dimensional space. The SVM learns what boundaries mark distinctions between each class type, and so:  when we extract the features from a test image--using the same method--the hope is that the description vector takes us to an area in the feature space that is common to vectors taken from images of the same class-type. \n\nWhether you use an SVM for this problem or not, I do believe that some of these feature extraction techniques could be useful, if fed into a neural network, rather than just a raw image.
