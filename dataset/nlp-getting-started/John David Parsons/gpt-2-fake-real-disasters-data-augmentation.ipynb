When working with images, the original dataset is often augmented by creating transformations of each image. For example, a single image of a chinchilla can be augmented in the following ways:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleju/imgaug-doc/master/readme_images/examples_grid.jpg\" width=\"450px\">\n\n(credit: https://github.com/aleju/imgaug)\n\nThis notebook is my attempt at doing a similar type of augmentation with **text**. Real tweets (after being cleaned by my other notebook [Tweet Cleaner](https://www.kaggle.com/jdparsons/tweet-cleaner)) are sent to the GPT-2 \"small\" 117M model as the starter text, and the output is assigned the same real-or-not label as the original text. The GPT-2 code is a modified version of the code found in this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/bkkaggle/generate-your-own-text-with-openai-s-gpt-2-117m.\n\nHere are some example results - good, bad, and hilarious. The generated text for disasters seems to pick up a \"news\" style of writing, while non-disaster text stays more casual. The GPT-2 default settings seem to result in lots of image credits and twitter links, which isn't ideal. **If you have any ideas for improving this notebook, please let me know in the comments!**\n\n| Original Text | Fake Text | Label |\n| :------------ | :-------------- | :----- |\n| Forest fire near La Ronge Sask.
