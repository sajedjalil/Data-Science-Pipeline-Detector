Tokenization is nothing but splitting the raw text into small chunks of words or sentences, called tokens. If the text is split into words, then its called as 'Word Tokenization' and if it's split into sentences then its called as 'Sentence Tokenization'. Generally 'space' is used to perform the word tokenization and characters like 'periods, exclamation point and newline char are used for Sentence Tokenization.  We have to choose the appropriate method as per the task in hand. While performing the tokenization few characters like spaces, punctuations are ignored and will not be the part of final list of tokens.\n\n![NLP_Tokenization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/NLP_Tokenization.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Why Tokenization is Required? <a id =\"2\"></a>\nEvery sentence gets its meaning by the words present in it. So by analyzing the words present in the text we can easily interpret the meaning of the text.

For example, we can use word count and word frequency to find out important of word in that sentence or document."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tokenization Techniques <a id =\"3\"></a>\nThere are multiple ways we can perform tokenization on given text data.
