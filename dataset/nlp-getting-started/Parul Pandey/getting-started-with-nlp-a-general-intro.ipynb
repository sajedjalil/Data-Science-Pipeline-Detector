This notebook explains the concepts of NLP with respect to this current competition. NLP is the field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. NLP sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)]. NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way.</p>\n\n<b>Notebooks in this series</b>\n\n  <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/getting-started-with-nlp\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1: Getting started with NLP : A General Introduction </a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/getting-started-with-nlp-2-countvectorizer\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2: Getting started with NLP: Part 2 - CountVectorizers | TFIDF | Hashing Vectorizer </a></li></ul>\n\n<hr>\n\nAnother notebook based on text processing is : [Basic preprocessing and EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/basic-preprocessing-and-eda/edit/run/31248388) based on the [Tweet Sentiment Extraction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction)\n\n## Dataset\nThe datasets contains a set of tweets which have been divided into a training and a test set. The training set contains a target column identifying whether the tweet pertains to a real disasteror not.\n\nOur job is to create a ML model to predict whether the test set tweets belong to a disaster or not, in the form of 1 or 0.This is a classic case of a Binary Classification problem. \n\n## Understanding the Evaluation Metric\n\nEvaluation metrics are used to measure the quality of the statistical or machine learning model.There are many different types of evaluation metrics available to test a model. These include classification accuracy, logarithmic loss etc. For this particluar problem, our submissions will be evaluated using **F1** between the predicted and expected answers. \n\nThe **F score**, also called the **F1 score** or **F measure**, is a measure of a test’s accuracy. \n\nThe F score is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of the test’s precision and recall. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/nC4QwrO.png)\n\n- Precision, also called the positive predictive value, is the proportion of positive results that truly are positive. \n\n- Recall, also called sensitivity, is the ability of a test to correctly identify positive results to get the true positive rate. \n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg/350px-Precisionrecall.svg.png)\n*source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall*\n\nThe  F score reaches the best value, meaning perfect precision and recall, at a value of 1. The worst F score, which means lowest precision and lowest recall, would be a value of 0. \n\n\n\n### Why is this Useful?\nThe F score is used to measure a test’s accuracy, and it balances the use of precision and recall to do it. The F score can provide a more realistic measure of a test’s performance by using both precision and recall. The F score is often used in information retrieval for measuring search, document classification, and query classification performance. \n          \n          \nsource: https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/f-score          ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n* [1.

Text Data Preprocessing\n\n## 1. Data Cleaning\n\nBefore we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process the data to get it all in a consistent format.We need to clean, tokenize and convert our data into a matrix. Some of the  basic text pre-processing techniques includes:\n\n* Make text all **lower case** or **uppercase** so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different\n* **Removing Noise** i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter i.e Punctuation, Numerical values,  common non-sensical text (/n)\n* **Tokenization**: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings.\n* **Stopword Removal**: Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words\n\n### More data cleaning steps after tokenization:\n\n* **Stemming**: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.\n* **Lemmatization**: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n* Parts of speech tagging\n* Create bi-grams or tri-grams\nAnd more...\n\nHowever, it is not necessary that you would need to use all these steps. The usage depends on your problem at hand. Sometimes removal of stop words helps while at other times, this might not help.Here is a nice table taken from the blog titled : [All you need to know about Text Preprocessing for Machine Learning & NLP](https://kavita-ganesan.com/text-preprocessing-tutorial/#.Xi2BhhczZTY) that summarizes how much preprocessing you should be performing on your text data:\n\n![](https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-23-at-1.36.52-PM-590x270.png)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# A quick glance over the existing data\ntrain['text'][:5]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Applying a first round of text cleaning techniques\n\ndef clean_text(text):\n    '''Make text lowercase, remove text in square brackets,remove links,remove punctuation\n    and remove words containing numbers.'''\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub('\\[.*?\\]', '', text)\n    text = re.sub('https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+', '', text)\n    text = re.sub('<.*?>+', '', text)\n    text = re.sub('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), '', text)\n    text = re.sub('\\n', '', text)\n    text = re.sub('\\w*\\d\\w*', '', text)\n    return text\n\n# Applying the cleaning function to both test and training datasets\ntrain['text'] = train['text'].apply(lambda x: clean_text(x))\ntest['text'] = test['text'].apply(lambda x: clean_text(x))\n\n# Let's take a look at the updated text\ntrain['text'].head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Just for fun let's create a wordcloud of the clean text to see the most dominating words in the tweets.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from wordcloud import WordCloud\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[26, 8])\nwordcloud1 = WordCloud( background_color='white',\n                        width=600,\n                        height=400).generate(\" \".join(disaster_tweets))\nax1.imshow(wordcloud1)\nax1.axis('off')\nax1.set_title('Disaster Tweets',fontsize=40);\n\nwordcloud2 = WordCloud( background_color='white',\n                        width=600,\n                        height=400).generate(\" \".join(non_disaster_tweets))\nax2.imshow(wordcloud2)\nax2.axis('off')\nax2.set_title('Non Disaster Tweets',fontsize=40);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Transforming tokens to a vector\nAfter the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. This can be done by a number of tecniques:\n\n## Bag of Words\n\nThe bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n\n- A vocabulary of known words.\n- A measure of the presence of known words.\n\nWhy is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.\n\nFor example, \n\n![](https://imgur.com/jWqtRP1.png)\n\n*source:[Natural Language Processing course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/home/welcome)*\n\nWe can do this using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer, where every row will represent a different tweet and every column will represent a different word.\n\n### Bag of Words - Countvectorizer Features\n\n[Countvectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts. It is important to note here that CountVectorizer comes with a lot of options to automatically do preprocessing, tokenization, and stop word removal.However, i did all the process manually above to just get a better understanding.
