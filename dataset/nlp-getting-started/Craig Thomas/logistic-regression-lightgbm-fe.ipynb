Training and Validating the Classifier\n\nNow it's time to acutally build a classifier and see how well it does. To evaluate how well our features are working, we're going to split up our training data into a training set and a validation set. We'll do this 5 times for a 5-fold cross validation. Our difference between sets gives us an idea how robust our model actually is to variations in training data. To handle our textual data, we're going to treat it as a bag-of-words and use a regression model. To represent the words, we'll use a TF/IDF vector (term frequency / inverse document frequency). Once we build the regressor, we'll use that to make predictions, and use the predicted outputs, along with our other features in a light GBM model to make actual predictions on the test data.
