Using AutoML, we are able to get an initial high performing solution without spending upfront time on feature engineering, model selection or hyperparameter tuning.    \nIn fact, aren't we already use 'grid-search' or 'argparse'?

But you have no influence on model structure or hyperparameter tuning.** So to make a difference, you should focuse on preprocessing.\n\nOne of the common confusions is to think \"Google Cloud AutoML Natural Language\" and \"Google Natural Language API\" service as the same thing. But they are different services.\n\n![gg](https://bs-uploads.toptal.io/blackfish-uploads/uploaded_file/file/25738/image-1562143062720-f7420426bbaa2da13ed582fbca314219.png)\n\nIf you want to know more details about Google AutoML, I strongly recommand this two docs.\n- [NLP With Google Cloud Natural Language API by MAXIMILIAN HOPF](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/google-nlp-tutorial)\n- [Google Cloud AutoML NL official docs](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/automl/docs/how-to)\n\nAlmost every code referred to below kernel.

Please note that Google AutoML is a **paid service**\n   \n   But dont worry. They give us $300 free credit when creating a new GCP project, and bonus credit when newly start the google AutoML NL service. Also they don't charge automatically if you don't agree it explicitly.\n    - [AutoML Pricing policy](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/automl/pricing?_ga=2.154004159.-640232925.1583643870&_gac=1.207751462.1584364219.EAIaIQobChMI66KVk8ae6AIV2aqWCh3VQwCxEAAYASAAEgI7ZvD_BwE) \n    - You can check your billing account status [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gHLTZoq.png)\n\n2. AutoML tends to work better on larger datasets and **takes a lot of times for training**. In our example, we pick a small dataset (few thousand rows) from [\"Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-startedwhere) competition. Even for this small dataset, it takes about 3~4 hours for trining.\n\n3. Understanding of GCS structure would help you.\n    - One GCS account can have several projects. The project corresponds to one application. \n    - A project has a storage you can upload or download data. The storage has serveral buckets.\n    - You can make serveral datasets in your project. From one dataset, one model is trained.\n\nSo, **we are going to create GCP project and upload our data to certain bucket. And then, we can make our dataset and develope model.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 0: Set up and link your Google Cloud Project\n\nIf you use AutoML on your local enviroments, you need to do some enviroment settings.
