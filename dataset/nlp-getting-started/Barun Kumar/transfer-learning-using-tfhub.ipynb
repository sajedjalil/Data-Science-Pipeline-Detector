For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks! The intution actually came from the humans. We humans always practice *Transfer Learning*. A person who knows how to drive a bike, finds it easy to learn how to drive a car. Similarly *Transfer Learning* helps in learning difficult tasks with less effort."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How Does TensorFlow Hub Help Us?\n**TensorFlow Hub** is a repository of pre-trained machine learning models.
