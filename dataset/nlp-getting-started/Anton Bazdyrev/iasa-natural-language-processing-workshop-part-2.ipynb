It is capable of capturing context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc.\nWhat are word embeddings exactly? Loosely speaking, they are vector representations of a particular word. Having said this, what follows is how do we generate them? More importantly, how do they capture the context?\nWord2Vec is one of the most popular technique to learn word embeddings using shallow neural network. It was developed by Tomas Mikolov in 2013 at Google.<br>\nLet’s tackle this part by part. <br>\n\n### Why do we need embeddings? \n\nConsider the following similar sentences: \n 1. Have a good day and Have a great day. \n 2. They hardly have different meaning. \n \nIf we construct an exhaustive vocabulary (let’s call it V), it would have V = {Have, a, good, great, day}.\nNow, let us create a one-hot encoded vector for each of these words in V. Length of our one-hot encoded vector would be equal to the size of V (=5). We would have a vector of zeros except for the element at the index representing the corresponding word in the vocabulary. That particular element would be one. The encodings below would explain this better. Have = [1,0,0,0,0]; a=[0,1,0,0,0]; good=[0,0,1,0,0]; great=[0,0,0,1,0]; day=[0,0,0,0,1]. <br>\nIf we try to visualize these encodings, we can think of a 5 dimensional space, where each word occupies one of the dimensions and has nothing to do with the rest (no projection along the other dimensions). This means ‘good’ and ‘great’ are as different as ‘day’ and ‘have’, which is not true. <br>\n\nOur objective is to have words with similar context occupy close spatial positions. Mathematically, the cosine of the angle between such vectors should be close to 1, i.e. angle close to 0.<br>\nHere comes the idea of generating distributed representations. Intuitively, we introduce some dependence of one word on the other words. The words in context of this word would get a greater share of this dependence. In one hot encoding representations, all the words are independent of each other, as mentioned earlier.<br>\n![](https://devopedia.org/images/article/220/3225.1569667846.png)<br>\n\n## How does Word2Vec work?\n\nWord2Vec is a method to construct such an embedding. It can be obtained using two methods (both involving Neural Networks): Skip Gram and Common Bag Of Words (CBOW)\n\n### CBOW Model\n\nThis method takes the context of each word as the input and tries to predict the word corresponding to the context. Consider our example: Have a great day.\n\nLet the input to the Neural Network be the word, great. Notice that here we are trying to predict a target word (day) using a single context input word great. More specifically, we use the one hot encoding of the input word and measure the output error compared to one hot encoding of the target word (day). In the process of predicting the target word, we learn the vector representation of the target word.\n\nLet us look deeper into the actual architecture.<br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*3DFDpaXoglalyB4c.png) <br>\n\nThe above model used a single context word to predict the target. We can use multiple context words to do the same.<br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1192/0*CCsrTAjN80MqswXG)\n\n### Skip-Gram model:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*Ta3qx5CQsrJloyCA.png) <br>\n\nThis looks like multiple-context CBOW model just got flipped. To some extent that is true.\n\nWe input the target word into the network. The model outputs C probability distributions. What does this mean?\n\nFor each context position, we get C probability distributions of V probabilities, one for each word. \n\n\nIn both the cases, the network uses back-propagation to learn.

Note: Basic feed forward networks “remember” things too, but they remember things they learnt during training. For example, an image classifier learns what a “1” looks like during training and then uses that knowledge to classify things in production.\n\nWhile RNNs learn similarly while training, in addition, they remember things learnt from prior input(s) while generating output(s). It’s part of the network. RNNs can take one or more input vectors and produce one or more output vectors and the output(s) are influenced not just by weights applied on inputs like a regular NN, but also by a “hidden” state vector representing the context based on prior input(s)/output(s). So, the same input could produce a different output depending on previous inputs in the series.\n\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2544/1*aIT6tmnk3qHpStkOX3gGcQ.png)<br>\n![](http://dprogrammer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RNN_Core2-1200x767.png)<br>\n![](http://dprogrammer.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5b03c40bc8c8e6b3585087d4093e3540_l3.png)<br>\n![](http://dprogrammer.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d534204b8eb3728edc81a0ce7f46c1d7_l3.png)<br>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from
