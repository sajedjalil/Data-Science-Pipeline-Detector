For example some tweets differ only in the URLs at the tail of string. It is reasonable to expect the URL tails are not very important for prediction of target and the tweets are semantically equal. To find such 'only URL different' tweets some cleaning of the 'text' strings is to be done. After the cleaning the tweets become equal as strings. Such semantically equivalent records in train set generate equivalence classes. What is important, there are classes, where tweets have 'mislabelling'. We can find 1 and 0 labels in the same class. But all tweets in a class are considered as semantically equal and as such must be all 0 xor all 1 labelled.<br>\nIn raw 'text' (without a cleaning) in the train set we can find 55 records with 'mislabelling' (the records generate 18 equivalence classes).<br>\n<br>\nIn https://www.kaggle.com/atpspin/same-tweet-two-target-labels (there is text cleaning in that model) 79 equivalence classes were detected with mislabelled tweets (here we have only 18).

The encoders are pre trained on several different tasks: (research article) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf. And a use case: https://towardsdatascience.com/use-cases-of-googles-universal-sentence-encoder-in-production-dd5aaab4fc15<br>\nTwo architectures are in use in the encoders: Transformer and Deep Averaging Networks. Transformer use \"self attention mechanism\" that learns contextual relations between words and (depending on model) even subwords in a sentence. Not only a word , but it position in a sentence is also taking into account (like positions of other words). There are different ways to implement the intuitive notion of \"contextual relation between words in a sentence\" ( so, different ways to construct \"representation space\" for the contextual words relation). If the several \"ways\" are implemented in a model in the same time: the term \"multi head attention mechanism\" is used.<br>\nTransformers have 2 steps. Encoding: read the text and transform it in vector of fixed length, and decoding: decode the vector (produce prediction for the task). For example: take sentence in English, encode, and translate (decode) in sentence in German.<br>\nFor our model we need only encoding mechanism: sentencies are encoded in vectors and supplied for classification to Support Vector Machine.<br>\nGood and intuitive explanation of the Transformer: http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ ; The original and quite famous now paper \"Attention is all you need\": (research article) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf.
