There’s a lot going on, but fundamentally for each pass in our loop we have a training phase and a validation phase. At each pass we need to:\n\n**Training loop:**\n\n* Tell the model to compute gradients by setting the model in train mode\n* Unpack our data inputs and labels\n* Load data onto the GPU for acceleration\n* Clear out the gradients calculated in the previous pass. In pytorch the gradients accumulate by default (useful for things like RNNs) unless you explicitly clear them out\n* Forward pass (feed input data through the network)\n* Backward pass (backpropagation)\n* Tell the network to update parameters with optimizer.step()\n* Track variables for monitoring progress\n\n\n**Evalution loop:**\n\n* Tell the model not to compute gradients by setting th emodel in evaluation mode\n* Unpack our data inputs and labels\n* Load data onto the GPU for acceleration\n* Forward pass (feed input data through the network)\n* Compute loss on our validation data and track variables for monitoring progress","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"XCE_3AnLOPpI","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def train(model, num_epochs,\\\n          optimizer,\\\n          train_dataloader, valid_dataloader,\\\n          model_save_path,\\\n          train_loss_set=[], valid_loss_set = [],\\\n          lowest_eval_loss=None, start_epoch=0,\\\n          device=\"cpu\"\n          ):\n  \"\"\"\n  Train the model and save the model with the lowest validation loss\n  \"\"\"\n  # We'll store a number of quantities such as training and validation loss, \n  # validation accuracy, and timings.\n  training_stats = []\n  # Measure the total training time for the whole run.\n  total_t0 = time.time()\n\n  model.to(device)\n\n  # trange is a tqdm wrapper around the normal python range\n  for i in trange(num_epochs, desc=\"Epoch\"):\n    # if continue training from saved model\n    actual_epoch = start_epoch + i\n\n    # ========================================\n    #               Training\n    # ========================================\n    \n    # Perform one full pass over the training set. \n    print(\"\")\n    print('======== Epoch {:} / {:} ========'.format(actual_epoch, num_epochs))\n    print('Training...')\n    \n    # Measure how long the training epoch takes.\n    t0 = time.time()\n    \n    # Set our model to training mode (as opposed to evaluation mode)\n    model.train()\n\n    # Tracking variables\n    tr_loss = 0\n    num_train_samples = 0\n\n    # Train the data for one epoch\n    for step, batch in enumerate(train_dataloader):\n        # Progress update every 40 batches.\n        if step % 40 == 0 and not step == 0:\n            # Calculate elapsed time in minutes.\n            elapsed = format_time(time.time() - t0)\n            # Report progress.\n            print('  Batch {:>5,}  of  {:>5,}.
