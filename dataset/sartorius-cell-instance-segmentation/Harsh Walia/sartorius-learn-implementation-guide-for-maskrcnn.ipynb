For example, Dropouts Layers, BatchNorm Layers etc. You need to turn off them during model evaluation, and .eval() will do it for you. In addition, the common practice for evaluating/validation is using `torch.no_grad()` in pair with model.eval() to turn off gradients computation:\n*[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60018578/what-does-model-eval-do-in-pytorch)    ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plots: the image, The image + the ground truth mask, The image + the predicted mask\ndef analyze_train_sample(model, ds_train, sample_index):\n    \n    img, targets = ds_train[sample_index]\n    plt.imshow(img.numpy().transpose((1,2,0)))\n    plt.title(\"Image\")\n    plt.show()\n    \n    masks = np.zeros((config.HEIGHT, config.WIDTH))\n    for mask in targets['masks']:\n        masks = np.logical_or(masks, mask)\n    plt.imshow(img.numpy().transpose((1,2,0)))\n    plt.imshow(masks, alpha=0.3)\n    plt.title(\"Ground truth\")\n    plt.show()\n    \n    model.eval()\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        preds = model([img.to(config.DEVICE)])[0]\n\n    plt.imshow(img.cpu().numpy().transpose((1,2,0)))\n    all_preds_masks = np.zeros((config.HEIGHT, config.WIDTH))\n    for mask in preds['masks'].cpu().detach().numpy():\n        all_preds_masks = np.logical_or(all_preds_masks, mask[0] > config.MASK_THRESHOLD)\n    plt.imshow(all_preds_masks, alpha=0.4)\n    plt.title(\"Predictions\")\n    plt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-07T08:54:15.160226Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-07T08:54:15.160817Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-07T08:54:15.170276Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-07T08:54:15.16078Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-07T08:54:15.169479Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# NOTE: It puts the model in eval mode!!
