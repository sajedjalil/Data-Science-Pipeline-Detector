Just separate your segments with the separation token tokenizer.sep_token.\n\nRoBERTa is an extension of BERT with changes to the pretraining procedure. The modifications include:\n\n- Training the model longer, with bigger batches, over more data\n- Removing the next sentence prediction objective\n- Training on longer sequences\n- Dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data. The authors also collect a large new dataset of comparable size to other privately used datasets, to better control for training set size effects.\n\nIt was proposed in 2019 by Yinhan Liu Et. al. in RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach\n\n### Introduction\nIn this article, we will walk through a baseline model for the Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments Competition on Kaggle.
