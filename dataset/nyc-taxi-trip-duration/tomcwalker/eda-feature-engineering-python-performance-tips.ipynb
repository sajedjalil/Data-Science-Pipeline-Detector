We need time of day, as we expect some cyclical behaviour here.\n\n### Day of week ###\nTraffic patterns will change daily due to work habits, people leaving for the weekend, and so forth. \n\n### Distance travelled and approximate speed ###\nWe can convert the longitude and latitude to a measure of point to point distance, and similarly get a measure of speed \"as the crow flies\".\n\nThe speed can't be used in our model, as it relies on the duration which we are trying to predict. However we can use it as a sanity check to filter out undesirable outliers from our training data. Unrealistically high speeds likely mean bad readings; unrealistically low speeds over long time periods probably mean someone has hired the cab for a protracted period on retainer. These latter cases will, I anticipate, be unpredictable. Better to just accept we will have some test error from such cases and exclude then than have them pollute our model for the cases which we can reasonably predict.\n\n### Day of month/month/date ###\nWe clearly want to separate out the date in some way. How best to do this? We might decide that the day of the month might have cyclical behaviour as we expect the day of the week to. I can't see a good reason for this, but might try to explore it graphically to see if there is some legitimacy to it.\n\nAs we have 1.45M rows, spread over approx 180 days (half a year), we have around 8k data points/day. That's enough for a good ML algorithm to work with without breaking it down further. So, instead of using day and month separately, I prefer for now to have the day and month combined into a date.\n\nTo make this easy for regression algorithms to work with we will represent date as an offset in days from the 1st Jan 2016. \n\n### Direction of travel ###\nManhattan's streets are laid out on a grid.  Traffic going one way in the morning may well reverse flow in the evening\nTraffic aligned with the grid may well have a more direct route. So perhaps direction of travel and/or grid alignment may be useful features. \n\nWhat direction do the streets go in? This link has a good analysis: http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/AvenuesOfManhattan/\n\nIt turns out the \"north/south\" streets actually run 29 degrees clockwise of north/south.\n\n### Grid alignment ###\nHow close are we to running a trip in direct alignment with the Manhattan grid? Is our journey aligned with the Manhattan avenues or streets, or is the trip more along the diagonal of the grid? This is something we can extract from the data.\n\n### Gridwise distance ###\nImagine the start and end points of a journey aligned with the grid, so the journey doesn't require any turns. The taxi will only need to cover the point to point distance. \nConversely, if the journey is along the grid diagonal, the journey would have to go along two sides of a triangle, so the required distance would be longer.\nIn general, if we imagine the journey is on a grid aligned with that of Manhattan, the gridwise distance is the distance covered along the two sides of a right angled triangle where the hypotenuse is between the start and end points of the journey.\nThis may be a useful feature as it will help any algorithm factor in alignment with the grid.\n\n## Other data sets ##\nOther things I would like to have information on include weather, unusual traffic issues, and major events such as sport home games. These can't be extracted from the data set we have, but perhaps we can find them elsewhere.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"6f763537-c213-4b6c-a238-19f8d66cd813","_uuid":"8d615c384cbfe37b195afeda7dabfb0385894b40","_execution_state":"idle"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"## A \"gotcha\" on generating features in pandas ##\nOne natural way, coming into python, to generate these features, is to:\n- Write a function that operates on a row\n- Apply that function to all rows using dataframe.apply.\nThis is give in one example below, and the way I first tried (being quite new to Python,). What with various bits of shunting data around, inferring, and so forth, it can be very slow.
