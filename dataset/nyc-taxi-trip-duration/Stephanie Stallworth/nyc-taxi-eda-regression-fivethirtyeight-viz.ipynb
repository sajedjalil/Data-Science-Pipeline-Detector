Graphs have been stylized to replicate visualizations published by popular data science blog, \"FiveThirtyEight\".  A full tutorial can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/).\n2. **[Algorithm Development](#ml)**: Train, test, and refine various models to predict the target variable.  Given that our dependent variable `trip_duration` is a continuous outcome,  the regression algorithms to be protoyped are as follows:\n - [Multivarite Linear Regression](#linear)  \n - [Decision Tree](#tree)\n - [Random Forest](#random)\n3. **[Model Deployment](#deployment)**: Apply the best performing model to the test set for contest submission.\n\n\n# **ABOUT THE DATA **  \nThe  dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform.

These observations are most likely errors and will need to removed from the dataset.    \n\nAnother red flag is that `passenger_count` has a maximum value of 9 passengers -  highly unlikely for an NYC taxicab.   According to the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, the maximum number of people allowed in a yellow taxicab, by law, is five passengers (in a five passenger taxicab).  There are exceptions for passengers under the age of 7 who may sit on an adult's lap. However, it is unlikely that a full 5 person taxi cab would have that many children under the age of 7 on board to yield a passenger count as high as 9.   This observation is likely an error and will also to be removed from the dataset.   \n\n**Longitude and Latitude Coordinates**  \nBased on different coordinate estimates of New York City, the latitude and longitude ranges are as follows:  \n- Latitude is between 40.7128 and 40.748817\n- Longitude is between  - 74.0059 and  - 73.968285 \n\nThe statisical summary of pick-up and drop-off coordinates show max and min observations that fall outside of the NYC city coordinate range.  I will exclude these data points as this analysis is  limited to New York City proper.\n\n**trip_duration**  \nLastly, there are unusual observations present in our target variable, `trip_duration`.  A max trip_duration of 3526282.00 sec (~ 980 hours) is not a  realistic trip time - a clear indication that outliers are present in the data.  A systematic way to remove these outliers is to exclude all data points that are a specified number of standard deviations away from the mean.  In this case, I will remove `trip_duration` observations that are more than two standard deviations away from the mean duration time, 959.492 sec (~15.99 min).","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"c140a82989c6baea686d89b36edc250ab2494cf4","_cell_guid":"4fa9462b-021a-48e6-9f0c-fe49e9d11857"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Remove passenger_count outliers\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['passenger_count']>0]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['passenger_count']<9]\n\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_longitude'] <= -73.968285]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_longitude'] >= -74.0059]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_latitude'] <= 40.748817]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_latitude'] >= 40.7128]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_longitude'] <= -73.968285]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_longitude'] >= -74.0059]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_latitude'] <= 40.748817]\n# train_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_latitude'] >= 40.7128]\n\n# Remove coordinate outliers\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_longitude'] <= -73.75]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_longitude'] >= -74.03]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_latitude'] <= 40.85]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['pickup_latitude'] >= 40.63]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_longitude'] <= -73.75]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_longitude'] >= -74.03]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_latitude'] <= 40.85]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['dropoff_latitude'] >= 40.63]\n\n# Remove trip_duration outliers\ntrip_duration_mean = np.mean(train_data['trip_duration'])\ntrip_duration_std = np.std(train_data['trip_duration'])\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['trip_duration']<=trip_duration_mean + 2*trip_duration_std]\ntrain_data = train_data[train_data['trip_duration']>= trip_duration_mean - 2*trip_duration_std]\n\n# Confirm removal\ntrain_data.describe().transpose()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a1e940dcb7603807dcdb0b9e6b57f0ccac1971f8","_cell_guid":"dc37746b-a369-44ee-b884-dbaf29c331e8"},"source":"## <a id=\"types\"></a> **Data Pre-Processing: Data Types**  \nNext, I'll do a quick review of the data types to confirm that the variables are being assigned correctly.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"11f45f56bba48028c657256a875f29bb8a4ededd","_cell_guid":"02d43ae5-8f88-420e-bde2-726e0d2fa56d"},"outputs":[],"source":"train_data.info()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8807cc3161ea073dbafb7276d00b524828099dfc","_cell_guid":"18b7a934-5a45-4522-b29e-1799ee1a5c5f"},"source":"The pickup and dropoff timestamp variables are being treated as non-null objects.

However, from the outset, it is important to underscore the assumptions we're making when using this model:\n1. **Linear Relationship:** The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n2. **Multivariate Normality:** The variables (features) are normally distributed.  If not, a non-linear transformation (e.g., log-transformation) may be needed to fix the issue.  \n3. **No or Little Multicollinearity:** The independent variables (features) are not highly correlated with each other.\n4. **No Auto-Corrlation:** Residuals are independent of one another (i.e., outcome is independent of a previous outcome).\n5.  **Homoscedasticity:** Residuals are equal across the regression line.\n\nThese assumptions may or may not be appropriate for this particular data set.  We can test these assumptions by seeing how well the Linear Regression performs.  <br\\>  \n\n[More Information About Assumptions](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-linear-regression/)\n\nDuring the training process, I will apply `GridSearchCV()` to use the best parameters possible to train the model.
