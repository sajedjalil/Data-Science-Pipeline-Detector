A thought wandered into my mind- is it really true ? are there no fancy visualization packages in python? So I started exploring them and found that it's absolutely wrong. So, **I will try to make this notebook as a visualization tutorial in python** and will be using data from NYC taxi competition to construct the visualizations. I will also be explaining in chronological order the way to interpret shown visualizations and how visualizations can provide beautiful ideas about new features. \n\nThis notebook may also be used by beginners to understand the analytical thinking, how each step will be guiding us to next step will be explained thoroughly. We will have an interpretation of the plot right below it and ideas we get by that figure. I will try to make it as comprehensive as possible and will try to cover all the following packages -\n\n| Serial No.  | Package     | Plots used in this kernel                          | Remark                              | Nature of plots\n| :----------:|:----------: | :-------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|1| **Matplotlib** |1. vendor_id histogram, 2. store and fwd flag histogram |Matplotlib is oldest and most widely used python visualization package, its a decade old but still its the first name come to our mind when it comes to plotting. Many libraries are built on top of it, and uses its functions in the backend. Its style is very simple and that's the reason plotting is fast in this. It is used to create axis and design the layout for plotting using other libraries like seaborn.| \n|2| **Seaborn** |1.Violin plot (passenger count vs trip duration), 2. Boxplots( Weekday vs trip duration, 3. tsplot (hours, weekday vs avg trip duration), 4. distplots of lat-long, and trip_duration |Seaborn is my favorite plotting library (Not at all a fan of house greyjoy though :P) Plots from this package are soothing to eyes. Its build as a wrapper on matplotlib and many matplotlib's functions are also work with it.colors are amazing in this package's plots|\n|3|**Pandas**  | 1. Parallel coordinates (for cluster characteristics) | Pandas also offer many plotting functions and it's also a package built on matplotlib, so you need to know matplotlib to tweak the defaults of pandas. It offers Alluvial plots (which are nowhere near what R offers as alluvial plots) which are used in this notebook to show cluster characteristics.|\n|4|**Bokeh** |1. Time series plot (day of the year vs avg trip duration) | Bokeh is one great package which offers interactive plots, you can use bokeh with other libraries like seaborn, data-shader or holoviews, but bokeh its offers various different kind of plots. zoom, axis, and interactive legends makes bokeh different than others| **Interactive**\n|5|**Folium** | 1.pickup locations in Manhattan, 2. cluster's location in the USA, 3. clusters location in Manhattan | This package offers geographical-maps and that too are interactive in nature. This package offers a different kind of terrains for maps- stemmer terrain, open street maps to name a few. you can place bubble at the locations, shift the zoom, and scroll the plot left-right-up-down and add interactions, for example - cluster plots shown in this notebook offers information about clusters like number of vehicles going out, most frequently visited clusters etc. *kaggle started supporting this package during this competition only* |**interactive**\n|6|**Pygmaps** | 1. location visualizations 2. cluster visualizations | Pygmaps is available as archive package and can't even be installed using pip install command, but this package was the predecessor of gamps package but offers few great interactions which even gmaps doesn't offer. for example, a scattering of a cluster can be plotting with this one better than with gmaps. This package was way underdeveloped and developed version of it is know as gmaps yet, it was able to generate beautiful vizs. plots made my this package are best viewed in browsers.|**interactive**\n|7|**Plotly**| 1.bubble plot |This is another great package which offers colorful visualizations, but some of these beautiful plots require to interact with plotly server so you need API key and it will call the API.|**interactive**\n|8|**Gmaps**|*To be updated*|gmaps provide great features like- route features, and we all are too used to gmaps, so feel like home.|**interactive**\n|9|**Ggplot2** | 1. Weather plots of NYC for given period | gglots are now available in python as well, and its kind of in developing state and documentation is less of this package which makes it a little difficult but at the same time it provides very beautiful plots, so there is a tradeoff ;)|**interactive**\n|10|**Basemaps**| *Will not be added in this kernel*|As long as you are not developing any maps related library, there are no benefits of using basemaps. They offer many options but using them is difficult, due to lots of arguments, different style, and less amount of documentation, and many lines of codes sometimes will be required to plot a map.|\n|11|**No package**| 1. heatmaps of NYC taxi traffic |Instead of depending on data-shadder, I tried plotting the heatmap of traffic data with a row image, you will get to know the basics of image processing( reading image, color schemes that's all :P ) and how such basic exercise can result in traffic heatmap|\n|12|**Datashader**| 1.locations' heatmap| If you really have a very large size of data that you want to plot on a map, data shader is one of the best easiest option available in marker. But I found that row image processing and generating plots using a scipy.mics or cv2 is considerably faster than using this package.|**interactive**\n|13|**Holoviews**|1. Pairplot for feature interaction.|Holoviews is another alternative for making interactive visualizations, this package offers artistic plots. But you need really good RAM etc to use this package, else the notebook will get hang. plots exported to HTML works perfectly fine|**interactive**\n\n*I have also included one **animation** in this notebook, using matplotlib's animation to show the pickup-drop heatmap for different hour of the day, i.e. density of pick-drops in different portion of the city with time.*\n\nSome of the above packages are not supported by kaggle kernels and you have to download the notebook to get them working, I will put such plots in either appendix or will explicitly mention it above the cell creating such plots. After going through all these visualizations, I will use the extracted features to build a XGBoost model to do the predictions. The main motive of this notebook is to explore what is available, and how it can be used to visualize the data better.\n\n\n## About Competition \nIn this competition, we are asked to build a model to predict trip duration for given pick and drop lat-long. We will keep on analyzing the data and extract features as we go forward with this notebook. Let's start getting our hands dirty with data.We will be using following datasets in this competition to generate a model and providing visuals -\n\n| Serial No.  | Datasets used | Description |\n| :----------:|:----------: |:-----------------------------:|\n|1|NYC taxi train-test| Datasets provided as standard data for this competition.\n|2|NYC OSRM dataset| Dataset contains, fastest route, and second fastest route and path, trip duration information.\n|3|Weather data| Dataset contain, precipitation, snowfall etc for given time duration of data.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b5f740990545aa8ad4552e4af6b5629a07f87d31","_cell_guid":"68911a30-9d36-4e4f-a4ed-560fac85826d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Importing packages for analysis"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f60942eb1d22ed39ab9ccef7e14a3f51d28d8a6d","_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"7796c42c-c271-47af-a17a-492772e34075"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd  #pandas for using dataframe and reading csv \nimport numpy as np   #numpy for vector operations and basic maths \n#import simplejson    #getting JSON in simplified format\nimport urllib        #for url stuff\n#import gmaps       #for using google maps to visulalize places on maps\nimport re            #for processing regular expressions\nimport datetime      #for datetime operations\nimport calendar      #for calendar for datetime operations\nimport time          #to get the system time\nimport scipy         #for other dependancies\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans # for doing K-means clustering\nfrom haversine import haversine # for calculating haversine distance\nimport math          #for basic maths operations\nimport seaborn as sns #for making plots\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for plotting\nimport os  # for os commands\nfrom scipy.misc import imread, imresize, imsave  # for plots \nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly\nfrom bokeh.palettes import Spectral4\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, output_notebook, show\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import *\nfrom matplotlib import cm\nfrom matplotlib import animation\nimport io\nimport base64\noutput_notebook()\nplotly.offline.init_notebook_mode() # run at the start of every ipython notebook","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"10dff8114b6dde38350ed094699ef68f02e96d60","_cell_guid":"06b782a3-cade-47ab-af5d-4026ce11ac1d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading and checking the head of training data and data from OSRM fastest route dataset\nTraining data is given as primary dataset for this competition and is available from the beginning of the competition.

This is similar to Gmaps but this is open source, so a user can make any number of queries using this engine ( Unlike Gmaps, where per day limit of free requests is 2000. Though I have compared the results of OSRM with that if Gmaps, Gmaps results considerably different than this one, almost all the results for time duration are different **with the same fraction**.

\n#### Coz, Uber uses it, hell NO!! \n#### Coz, Everyone in this competition is using it, Hell NO!!\n#### Coz - \n\nWhen I started writing this kernel and working for this competition, The most easy approach that came to my mind to use Gmaps, use in some way hacking to request trip-duration for given lat-long, So I have started writing code for calling google gmaps API, but latter found that using gmaps distance matrix API only 2000 requests can be processed. So, My initial plan got failed, and remaining of which I have kept in Appendix of this kernel :P \n\nSo, 2000 requests can be processed right? I thought okay let's make groups for which I will make the API requests and then using some approximation ( haversine distance or any distance and avg vendor speed) I will predict the ride time), So 45C2 = 1980, So settled with 45 clusters that time. =>That's where it struck me that clustering can be a very important feature even if we don't use distance matrix. Clustering can give us many pieces of information like - if we know pickup is in cluster 4 and drop is in cluster 9, and max flow from cluster 4 is to cluster 9, we will know that the trip-duration is going to be more than otherwise. \n\n** That's exactly the way Uber decides surge pricing, if there is more flow from x cluster to z cluster, surge will be different, and from x to w surge will be different and will be less than x to z trip.** \n\nAs now Kaggle has folium package installed, so I will be using folium package for visualizations and we will be visualizing clusters on maps. Folium is map-based interactive package and it's open source as well. It's based on leaflet js, it is great to see that finally python docker (kaggle) too have such nice map package available. It is interactive in nature, balloons on the map can be clicked and they will show characteristics of that clusters.( flow of rides and what not, you can code anything..)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d87f7f0a84271a6afbdfb1d47a37f48a00ece1d8","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"990ec289-afbc-471c-acd2-b8e4a6d81d7d"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"start = time.time()\ndef assign_cluster(df, k):\n    \"\"\"function to assign clusters \"\"\"\n    df_pick = df[['pickup_longitude','pickup_latitude']]\n    df_drop = df[['dropoff_longitude','dropoff_latitude']]\n    \"\"\"I am using initialization as from the output of\n    k-means from my local machine to save time in this kernel\"\"\"\n    init = np.array([[ -73.98737616,   40.72981533],\n       [-121.93328857,   37.38933945],\n       [ -73.78423222,   40.64711269],\n       [ -73.9546417 ,   40.77377538],\n       [ -66.84140269,   36.64537175],\n       [ -73.87040541,   40.77016484],\n       [ -73.97316185,   40.75814346],\n       [ -73.98861094,   40.7527791 ],\n       [ -72.80966949,   51.88108444],\n       [ -76.99779701,   38.47370625],\n       [ -73.96975298,   40.69089596],\n       [ -74.00816622,   40.71414939],\n       [ -66.97216034,   44.37194443],\n       [ -61.33552933,   37.85105133],\n       [ -73.98001393,   40.7783577 ],\n       [ -72.00626526,   43.20296402],\n       [ -73.07618713,   35.03469086],\n       [ -73.95759366,   40.80316361],\n       [ -79.20167796,   41.04752096],\n       [ -74.00106031,   40.73867723]])\n    k_means_pick = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init=init, n_init=1)\n    k_means_pick.fit(df_pick)\n    clust_pick = k_means_pick.labels_\n    df['label_pick'] = clust_pick.tolist()\n    df['label_drop'] = k_means_pick.predict(df_drop)\n    return df, k_means_pick\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"time taken by thie script by now is {}.\".format(end-start))","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1ebf8e93142edb678f9d83c1a5ea94050d25af36","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c50de5dc-7c2f-44da-b7f2-53ae60cd501e"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"start = time.time()\ntrain_cl, k_means = assign_cluster(train_data, 20)  # make it 100 when extracting features \ncentroid_pickups = pd.DataFrame(k_means.cluster_centers_, columns = ['centroid_pick_long', 'centroid_pick_lat'])\ncentroid_dropoff = pd.DataFrame(k_means.cluster_centers_, columns = ['centroid_drop_long', 'centroid_drop_lat'])\ncentroid_pickups['label_pick'] = centroid_pickups.index\ncentroid_dropoff['label_drop'] = centroid_dropoff.index\n#centroid_pickups.head()\ntrain_cl = pd.merge(train_cl, centroid_pickups, how='left', on=['label_pick'])\ntrain_cl = pd.merge(train_cl, centroid_dropoff, how='left', on=['label_drop'])\n#train_cl.head()\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time taken in clustering is {}.\".format(end -

So, which brings us to idea of clsuteing them and then analysing where the clusters are falling. Expected is that most of the clusters will fall in manhattan and few will fall nearby manhattan.\n\nExcept it clustering is very advisible as total number of queries in train data is ~1.4M, which is very larger number , and using google map's distance matrix the pickup address, drop address, and shortest path distance for cars, and avg time taken from pickup tpo drop is not possible as free query limit is 2500 queries per day. so, if we do clustering and we reduce the number of queries, we ca use distance matrix's data for going from centroid of one cluster to another and then using normal, haversine or manhattan distance for going from centroid of cluster to destination. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"38ed48b9b25a4d37654a982ca23b43b7c434b159","_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"53588cc4-f7c6-4d4d-b693-32f17d007573"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"df_cluster4 = train_cl","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"05daafb97d09836fd4281b98856682ea1a01aa30","_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"84b4ffe3-6fc9-4f76-973e-6f8fb728b9ab"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"start = time.time()\ncentroid_drops = centroid_pickups.rename(columns={'centroid_pick_long':'centroid_drop_long', 'centroid_pick_lat':'centroid_drop_lat','label_pick':'label_drop'})\ncentroid_drops.head()\nclus5 = df_cluster4 # just to be safe side so store it\ndf_cluster4 = pd.merge(df_cluster4, centroid_drops, how='left', on=['label_drop'])\ndf_cluster4.head()\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"time taken by thie script by now is {}.\".format(end-start))","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"607bba6110fd7e3ce92c648c7529cd53c150649c","_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c07d2b6c-bdec-4c7a-bffa-d4dd0c10dafb"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\ndef bar_plot(x_var, y_var):\n    \"\"\"function to show barplot between two variables\"\"\"\n    objects = x_var\n    performance = y_var\n    plt.bar(objects, performance, align='center', alpha=0.5)\n    plt.xlabel('class')\n    plt.ylabel('frequency')\n    plt.title('barplot') \n    plt.show()\n    return 0\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"time taken by thie script by now is {}.\".format(end-start))","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3c51143ac0fb83abd23ef3eedb341e6c52c59756","_cell_guid":"34d3be95-0193-497a-b7bc-b924d617efda"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Cluster processing and distance matrix query "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"10bb2c08684d24e0b57d3beca8b7517a0fcc2e70","_cell_guid":"4dc3e538-4017-431a-8e04-477704de6c34"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### cluster vs trip time\n##### Hypothesis is if trip starts and ends in same cluster, duration of that trip will be less than trips where pickup and dropoff are in different clusters"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"98f5a3094300ed76f59d654557d84412d93d3f06","_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"54e17380-5a6f-4aad-aaa0-042a65bb9223"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"df_cluster3 = df_clusters2\ndf_cluster3['diff']= abs(df_clusters2['label_pick']- df_clusters2['label_drop'])\nsummary_s = pd.DataFrame(df_cluster3.groupby('diff')['trip_duration'].sum())\nsummary_c = pd.DataFrame(df_cluster3.groupby('diff')['trip_duration'].count())\nsummary_c.rename(columns={'trip_duration': 'count'}, inplace=True)\nsummary_pertrip = pd.concat([summary_s, summary_c], axis=1)\nsummary_pertrip.head()\nsummary_pertrip['time_pt'] = summary_pertrip['trip_duration']/summary_pertrip['count']\nbar_plot(summary_pertrip.index.values, summary_pertrip.time_pt.values)\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"time taken by thie script by now is {}.\".format(end-start))"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cb2f2d863cd2d49e678b25bc150ad648a996db93","_cell_guid":"fb5462ea-8740-49ae-a623-a3fbd0c3d587"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Clear from above plot that trips ending in same clusters have minimum time \n### Let's visualize location of clusters (All clusters) on google maps -
