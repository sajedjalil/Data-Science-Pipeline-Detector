This speed value is used to estimate the trip duration aswell. It turns out that this estimated trip duration is a better estimation for the trip duration than the total travel time variable of the fastest route dataset that is commonly used in models. A very simple LightGBM regressor is trained to verify that the 2 estimated features can improve a model's performance. This regressor scores 0.388 on the leaderboard. Without the estimated features that model scores 0.002 worse.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"677e61c0-73f4-4c92-ba5e-9b53e36f705a","_uuid":"4dc2857caed65d6c5e69ee544585b2dd2e43ab76"},"source":"# Introduction\n\noscarleo shared a pretty nice dataset about the fastest routes of the trips: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/discussion/37033\nThis dataset contains some features (total_distance, total_travel_time, number_of_steps) that improve the accuracy of a model by a pretty good amount. However such a valuable dataset may allow to extract more valuable features.\n\nSo this kernel focuses on estimating the speed a trip will travel along its shortest path. This will be done by averaging the speed of all trips that have used the respective street. The distance one trip has travelled on one street will be used as a weight such that as longer one trip was on a street as more will it contribute to the street's speed average.\n\nIt can be expected that the average speed a trip will have on one street depends on the time that trip happens. This will be explored first and so will the average speed on a street calculated for different groups of time.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d593ec05-24d8-4a62-bd40-076e1cff6305","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"bc06c81611d573579db7c364431de62010b2c2e3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport datetime as dt\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMRegressor\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, RobustScaler\n\nsns.set()","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a61f6518-5218-4955-b3c5-844c771b23a6","_uuid":"eb431450c332fbec03d96f5680ada6e15a3a6e2b"},"source":"# Data preparation\nAt first the data will be loaded, some necessary features added that will be needed later and at last merged with the fastest route dataset.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"44572425-7941-4626-923a-819ce31a8b68","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"dab36a5d45fe99a619b489f8e90926a59618a7f4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm/train.csv')\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm/test.csv')","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b45f8b04-1d91-403e-a7cd-4ee18e9c69d0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6960917f37803a37c25856a00db17d7d3e75b126"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"def add_features(data):\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['pickup_datetime'])\n\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_time'] = data.pickup_datetime.apply(lambda x: x.hour * 3600 + x.minute * 60 + x.second)\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_yearday'] = data.pickup_datetime.apply(lambda x: x.timetuple().tm_yday)\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_weekday'] = data.pickup_datetime.apply(dt.datetime.weekday)\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_yearweek'] = data.pickup_datetime.apply(lambda x: x.isocalendar()[1])\n    data.loc[:, 'pickup_hour'] = np.floor(data.pickup_time / 3600)\n    data.loc[:, 'holiday'] = data.pickup_yearday.apply(lambda x: 1 if x in [1, 18, 46, 151] else 0)\n    \n    return data\ndf_train = add_features(df_train)\ndf_test = add_features(df_test)","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d2967030-0171-46d5-b077-ee4862c22047","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"7245456c321394afeb5f27023bbbc4fdf87cbd12"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"df_train_osrm1 = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm/fastest_routes_train_part_1.csv')\ndf_train_osrm2 = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm/fastest_routes_train_part_2.csv')\ndf_train_osrm = pd.concat([df_train_osrm1, df_train_osrm2])\ndf_test_osrm = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm/fastest_routes_test.csv')\n\ndf_train = pd.merge(df_train, df_train_osrm, how = 'left', on = 'id')\ndf_test = pd.merge(df_test, df_test_osrm, how = 'left', on = 'id') ","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f03fbb91-f4bb-468b-8f1a-14456784e1d3","_uuid":"d9ac14df1b4e4c2840d01e5dfae569bb626ba540"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"ind = df_train.total_travel_time > 0\nprint('{} rows without fastest route in training data'.format(len(df_train[ ~ind ])))\ndf_train.loc[ind, 'speed'] = df_train.loc[ind, 'total_distance'] / df_train.loc[ind, 'trip_duration']\ndf_train.loc[~ind, 'speed'] = 0","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f8a945d4-a67c-4650-8282-a8756d24666a","_uuid":"1d3b99cdf93e8a12bc9cd21d8846115e80d291f4"},"source":"# Exploration\nAs mentioned earlier it is expected that the average speed depends on the time and that the average speed of trips on a street should be calculated for different time bins.

But one can see that the distribution for saturday and sunday are similar and the distributions for the remaining days are a little similar aswell. However tuesday, wednesday and thursday are closer to each other than they are to monday and friday. This can be partly explained by the fact that the only holidays in the first half of 2016 were on monday and on friday. At least these are the days the holidays package returns:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/discussion/37192. \n\nThe evening (after 20:00) is different though. One would expect the distributions of friday and saturday are similar and that the distributions of the remaining ones are also similar. At least this is true for the first statement.\n\nHowever calculating the average speed of each street for each hour bin for each day of a week would be very much so this will be reduced further. At first there will only 12 hour bins taken. The next plot will show that the information of the distributions differences is still very well contained. The second next plot will show that the average speed of mondays and fridays that were holidays (1st, 18th, 46th and 151th day of the year) is rather comparable to the weekend.\n\nSo the average speed of a street will be calculated in 12 different hour bins and 2 bins that represent whether the respective day is a working day or not. At least as long as the trip started before 20:00. If it started later the trip will only be categorized as a trip on a day without work if the next day is a saturday, sunday or holiday. \n\nFurthermore all trips with speed larger than 20 m/s (72 km/h, 45 miles/h) will not be considered for the speed average calculations of a street. I don't know the actual speed limits in NYC but these can most likely be considered as wrong data.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7b4c0afa-64fa-47eb-9400-2d75e7119cc0","_uuid":"8d67fc94730f7dfa6c422114a2d3ff19b4621d3e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"df_train.loc[:, 'pickup_hour_bin'] = np.floor(df_train.pickup_time / (2*3600))\ndf_test.loc[:, 'pickup_hour_bin'] = np.floor(df_test.pickup_time / (2*3600))\ndf_gby_h = df_train.loc[ind & (df_train.holiday == 0), ['pickup_hour_bin', 'pickup_weekday', 'speed']].groupby(['pickup_hour_bin', 'pickup_weekday']).agg(np.mean).reset_index()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 6))\nfor d in range(7):\n    plt.errorbar(x = df_gby_h[ df_gby_h.pickup_weekday == d ].pickup_hour_bin * 2 + 1, \n                 y = df_gby_h[ df_gby_h.pickup_weekday == d ].speed, \n                 xerr = 1, marker = '', linestyle = '', label = dict_weekday[d], color = colors[d]\n                )\nplt.xlabel('hour')\nplt.ylabel('average speed [m/s]')\nplt.legend(loc = 0)\nplt.ylim(0, 11)\nplt.xticks(range(25))\nplt.yticks(range(12))\nplt.show()","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b31f88ba-5c2c-417b-bcf2-85e898168559","_uuid":"337411e720a1a9e01a8f4dbf060f300e916ee6f6"},"source":"These distributions still contain the differences very well.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6505cfa8-203f-4241-846b-348f3e30af35","_uuid":"497d6082eeb78fee1f93edd256f010e6be885c57"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"df_gby_wh = df_train.loc[ind & (df_train.speed < 20), ['pickup_weekday', 'holiday', 'speed']].groupby(['pickup_weekday', 'holiday'])['speed'].agg([np.mean, np.std]).reset_index()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 6))\n(_, caps, _) = plt.errorbar(data = df_gby_wh[ df_gby_wh.holiday == 1 ], \n            x = 'pickup_weekday', y = 'mean', yerr = 'std', capsize = 10,\n            marker = 'o', linestyle = '', label = 'holiday', color = 'blue')\nfor cap in caps:\n    cap.set_markeredgewidth(1)\n    \n(_, caps, _) = plt.errorbar(data = df_gby_wh[ df_gby_wh.holiday == 0 ], \n            x = 'pickup_weekday', y = 'mean', yerr = 'std', capsize = 10,\n            marker = 'o', linestyle = '', label = 'no holiday', color = 'green')\nfor cap in caps:\n    cap.set_markeredgewidth(1)\n    \nplt.axhline(y=np.mean(df_train.loc[ind & (df_train.speed < 20) & (df_train.holiday == 1), 'speed']), \n            color='blue', linestyle='dashed', alpha = 0.5)\nplt.axhline(y=np.mean(df_train.loc[ind & (df_train.speed < 20) & (df_train.holiday == 0), 'speed']),  \n            color='green', linestyle='dashed', alpha = 0.5)\n\nplt.ylabel('average speed [m/s]')\nplt.xticks([k for k in dict_weekday.keys()], [v for v in dict_weekday.values()])\nplt.ylim(0, 10)\nplt.legend(loc = 3)\nplt.show()","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"892b2c82-2566-4762-bdac-9d8dbb5ea2c5","_uuid":"37c461aaaadcfb08d815dbbc088d5ceb083a4997"},"source":"The average speed of mondays and fridays that were holidays are closer to the average speed of sundays.
