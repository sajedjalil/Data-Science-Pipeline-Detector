Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security. As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.\n\n### Goals\nThe goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender. Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.\n\n### Metric\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label.\n\n#### Initial thanks and inspirations for this kernel - sources:\n- https://www.kaggle.com/theoviel/load-the-totality-of-the-data\n- https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/is-this-malware-eda-fe-and-lgb-updated\n\n## Table of Contents\n1.

From version 22 and later versions of this Kernel, I was experimenting with Baseline XGboost and trying to find the optimal parameters via tuning. Feature Engineering still missing due to the fact that I dive into so much to tuning and trying to improve the classifier's performance and lost focus on other subjects but I will come back to that later. Tuning causes Kaggle to terminate my kernels due to timeout limitations. From Version #61 and so on I work with XGBoost classifers with optimal parameters found from my previous kernels. After the end of the competition and with the reveal of the private dataset, I am starting to suspect that my final tuned models are a bit overfitted and have to generalize.\n\n#### Version
