Contrarily, the incidence of knee injuries on rush plays increases on synthetic turf. \n\n2. For just kickoffs, it seems that knee injuries decrease on synthetic turf. Ankle and foot injuries are reported on kickoffs on synthetic turf, whereas none were reported on natural turf, though the count of such injuries is low.\n\n3. Analyzing just punt plays, the incidence of ankle injuries on returned punts are similar across turf types, but on the \"punt\" play type (the definition of which is unclear), both ankle and knee injury incidences decrease on synthetic turf.\n\n4.
