Lately, there has been a lot of emphasis on creating inherently interpretable models and doing away from their black box counterparts. EBMs or [Explainable Boosting Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MREiHgHgl0k),are models designed to have accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning methods like Random Forest and Boosted Trees while being highly intelligible and explainable. In this notebook, we will look at the idea behind EBMs and implement them for the given problem via [InterpretML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09223.pdf), a Unified Framework for Machine Learning Interpretability.\n\nThis notebook is an extension of an article I wrote on the same topic, which you would find useful : [Interpretable or Accurate? Why Not Both?](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-or-accurate-why-not-both-4d9c73512192?sk=2f44377541a2f49939c921e54eb3cde7)\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What are EBMs?\n\nEBM is a type of [generalized additive mode](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-1/issue-3/Generalized-Additive-Models/10.1214/ss/1177013604.full)l or GAM for short. Linear models assume a linear relationship between the response and predictors. Thus, they are unable to capture the non-linearities in the data.\n\nLinear Model: y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + … + βn xn\n\nTo overcome this shortcoming, in the late 80’s statisticians [Hastie & Tibshirani developed generalized additive models](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-1/issue-3/Generalized-Additive-Models/10.1214/ss/1177013604.full)(GAMs), which keep the additive structure, and therefore the interpretability of the linear models. Thus, the linear relationship between the response and predictor variable gets [replaced by several non-linear smooth functions](https://datascienceplus.com/generalized-additive-models/)(f1, f2, etc.) to model and capture the non-linearities in the data. GAMs are more accurate than simple linear models, and since they do not contain any interactions between features, users can also easily interpret them.\n\nAdditive Model: y = f1(x1) + f2(x2) + … + fn(xn)\n\nEBMs are an improvement on the GAMs utilizing techniques like gradient boosting and bagging. EBMs include pairwise interaction terms, which increases their accuracy even further.\n\nEBMs: y = Ʃi fi (xi) + Ʃij fij(xi , xj) + Ʃijk fijk (xi , xj , xk )\n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## IntepretML: A Unified Framework for Machine Learning Interpretability\n\nEBMs come packaged within a Machine Learning Interpretability toolkit called [InterpretML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09223.pdf). It is an open-source package for training interpretable models as well as explaining black-box systems. Within InterpretML, the explainability algorithms are organized into two major sections, i.e., **Glassbox models** and **Blackbox explanations**. This means that this tool can not only explain the decisions of inherently interpretable models but also provide possible reasoning for black-box models.
