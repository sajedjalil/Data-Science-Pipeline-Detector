The reason is that trees can capture non-linear, complex relationships that linear functions cannot.\n\nSo, the only question is which tree booster should you pass to the `booster` parameter - `gbtree` or `dart`?\n\nI won’t bother you with the full differences here. The thing you should know is that XGBoost uses an ensemble of decision tree-based models when used with gbtree booster.\n\nDART trees are an improvement (to be yet validated) where they introduce random dropping of the subset of the decision trees to prevent overfitting.\n\nIn the few small experiments I did with default parameters for `gbtree` and `dart`, I got slightly better scores with dart when I set the `rate_drop` between 0.1 and 0.3.\n\nFor more details, I refer you to [this page](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dart.html) of the XGB documentation to learn about the nuances and additional hyperparameters.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.

A weak learner is any algorithm that performs slightly better than random guessing.\n\nBy combining the predictions of multiples of weak learners, XGBoost yields a final, robust prediction (skipping a lot of details now).\n\nEach time we fit a tree to the data, it is called a single boosting round.\n\nSo, to specify the number of trees to be built, pass an integer to `num_boost_round` of the Learning API or to `n_estimators` of the Sklearn API.\n\nTypically, too few trees lead to underfitting, and a too large number of trees lead to overfitting.

For example, setting it to 50 means we stop the training if the predictions have not improved for the last 50 rounds.\n\nIt is a good practice to set a higher number for `n_estimators` and change early stopping accordingly to achieve better results.\n\nBefore I show an example of how it is done in code, there are two other XGBoost parameters to discuss.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 8.

Should you let XGBoost deal with missing values?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For this, I will give the advice I've got from two different Kaggle Competition Grandmasters.\n\n1. If you give `np.nan` to tree-based models, then, at each node split, the missing values are either send to the left child or the right child of the node, depending on what's best. So, at each split, missing values get special treatment, which may lead to overfitting. A simple solution that works pretty well with trees is to fill in nulls with a value different than the rest of the samples, like -999.\n\n2. Even though packages like XGBoost and LightGBM can treat nulls without preprocessing, it is always a good idea to develop your own imputation strategy.\n\nFor real-world datasets, you should always investigate the type of missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and choose an imputation strategy (value-based [mean, median, mode] or model-based [KNN imputers or tree-based imputers]).\n\nIf you are not familiar with these terms, I got you covered [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/going-beyond-the-simpleimputer-for-missing-data-imputation-dd8ba168d505?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 12.

When this value is small, each node will group a smaller and smaller number of samples in each node.\n\nIf it is small enough, the trees will be highly likely to overfit the peculiarities in the training data. So, set a high value for this parameter to avoid overfitting.\n\nThe default value is 1, and its value is only limited to the number of rows in the training data. However, a good range to try for tuning is 2–10 or up to 20.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 18. How to tune gamma in XGBoost?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A more challenging parameter is `gamma`, and for laypeople like me, you can think of it as the complexity control of the model. The higher the gamma, the more regularization is applied.\n\nIt can range from 0 to infinity - so, tuning it can be tough. Also, it is highly dependent on the dataset and other hyperparameters. This means there can be multiple optimal gammas for a single model.\n\nMost often, you can find the best gamma within 0–20.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 19. How to tune reg_alpha and reg_lambda in XGBoost?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These parameters refer to regularization strength on feature weights. In other words, increasing them will make the algorithm more conservative by placing less importance on features with low coefficients (or weights).\n\n`reg_alpha` refers to L1 regularization of Lasso regression and `reg_lambda` for Ridge regression.\nTuning them can be a real challenge since their values can also range from 0 to infinity.\n\nFirst, choose a wide interval such as [1e5, 1e2, 0.01, 10, 100]. Then, depending on the optimum value returned from this range, choose a few other nearby values.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 20.
