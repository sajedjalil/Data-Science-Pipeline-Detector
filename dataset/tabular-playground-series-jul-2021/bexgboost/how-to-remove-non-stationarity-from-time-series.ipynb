In other words, algorithms perform best when the inputs and outputs are **stationary**.\n\nThis is not the case in time series forecasting. Distributions that change over time can have unique properties such as seasonality and trend. These, in turn, cause the mean and variance of the series to fluctuate, making it hard to model their behavior.\n\nSo, making a distribution stationary is a strict requirement in time series forecasting.

And if the time series is granular enough (such as minutes or seconds frequencies), models may even end up with more parameters than actual data.\n\nThis type of variable relationship between inputs and outputs will seriously compromise the decision function of any model. If the relationship keeps changing through time, models end up using an outdated relationship or one that does not contribute to its predictive power.\n\nTherefore, you must dedicate a certain amount of time to detecting non-stationarity and removing its effects during your workflow.\n\nWe will see an example of this in the coming sections.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Examples of non-stationary series <small id='2'></small>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#toc'>Back to Top 🔝</a>\n\nTake a look at these plots and try to guess which of the lines represent a stationary series:\n\n![](https://otexts.com/fpp2/fpp_files/figure-html/stationary-1.png)\n<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <strong>\n        Image by <a href='https://otexts.com/fpp2/'>otexts.com</a> [1]\n    </strong>\n</figcaption>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since stationary series have constant variance, we can rule out **a, c, e, f**, and **i**. These plots show a clear upward or downward trend or changing levels like in f.\n\nSimilarly, as **d** and **h** show seasonal patterns, we can rule them out too. \n\nBut how about **g** - the pattern does look it is seasonal.\n\n**g** is the plot of the [lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx) population growth. When food becomes scarce, they stop breeding, causing the population numbers to plummet. When the food sources replenish, they start reproducing again, making the population grow.\n\nThis cyclic behavior is not the same as seasonality. When seasonality exists, you know exactly what will happen after a certain period of time. In contrast, the cyclic behavior of lynx population growth is unpredictable. You can't guess the timing of the food cycles and this makes the series stationary.\nSo, the only stationary series are b and g.\n\nTricky distributions like **d, f**, and **h** can make you question whether identifying non-stationary data visually is the best option. As you observed, it is pretty easy to confuse seasonality with random cycles or trends with white noise.\n\nFor this reason, the next section will be about statistical methods of detecting non-stationary time series.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Detecting non-stationarity statistically <small id='3'></small>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#toc'>Back to Top 🔝</a>\n\nIn the statistics world, there are several tests under the label of [unit root tests](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnit_root_test%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520statistics%252C%2520a%2520unit%2520root%2Cdepending%2520on%2520the%2520test%2520used.).
