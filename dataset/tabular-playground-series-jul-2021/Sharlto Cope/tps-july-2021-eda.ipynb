In the past, Kaggle have launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than Featured competition, and thus more beginner-friendly.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition.\n\nThe dataset is used for this competition is based on a real dataset, but has synthetic-generated aspects to it. The original dataset deals with predicting air pollution in a city via various input sensor values (e.g., a time series).\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using the mean column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. The RMSLE for a single column calculated as:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\text{log}(p_{i}+1)-\\text{log}(a_{i}+1))^2}, $$\n\n\nwhere $n$ is the total number of observations, $p_{i}$ is your prediction, $a_{i}$ is the actual value, $\\text{log}(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$.\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns, in this case, 3.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"2\"></a>\n# 2 Preparations\nPreparing packages and data that will be used in the analysis process.

An overview on train and test datasets will include a quick analysis on missing values and basic statistics, while sample submission will be loaded to see the expected submission.\n\nThe main objective of the competition is predicting the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors. Three target values to predict are: `target_carbon_monoxide`, `target_benzene`, and `target_nitrogen_oxides`\n\nAs there is no official data definition, a guess of data definition has been performed. The data may contains the following descriptions:\n- **date_time** is date and time when the sensors recording occured within interval of 1 hour.\n- **deg_C** is air temperature measured in Celsius/Centigrade.\n- **relative_humidity** is a term used to describe the amount of water vapor that exists in a gaseous mixture of air and water and is expressed in a percentage.\n- **absolute_humidity** is the measure of water vapor (moisture) in the air, regardless of temperature.\n- **sensor_1** to **sensor_5** is the sensors recording value.\n\nThree target values:\n- **target_carbon_monoxide** is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, flammable gas that is slightly less dense than air.\n- **target_benzene** is is a chemical that is a colorless or light yellow liquid at room temperature. It has a sweet odor and is highly flammable.\n- **target_nitrogen_oxides** is a family of poisonous, highly reactive gases. These gases form when fuel is burned at high temperatures.\n\n<a id=\"3.1\"></a>\n## 3.1 Train dataset\nAs stated before, train dataset is mainly used to train predictive model as there is an available target variable in this set. This dataset is also used to explore more on the data itself including find a relation between each predictors and the target variable.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Date and time of sensors recording is starting from `10-Mar-2010` at `6 p.m.` to `31-Dec-2010` which is a span of  `10 months` of recording.\n- The lowest temperature that has been recorded in `deg_C` is `1.3` with the highest temperature of `46.1`. The mean of `20.9`  can be considered a normal temperature in many countries if it measures in Celsius so it may be reasonable to assume the value in the column is in degree Celsius.\n- `relative_humidity` is measured in percentage and has a range of `8.9%` to `90.8%` in the `train` dataset. \n- `absolute_humidity` has a range of `0.2` to `2.2`.         \n- It seems all the records from `sensor_1` to `sensor_5` were coming from a same type of machine that may be place in several different places as there are no big differences between each sensor which have a range from `242.7` to `2913.8`. \n- `target_carbon_monoxide` has a range of `0.1` to `12.5`, `target_benzene` has a range of `0.1` to `63.7` and `target_nitrogen_oxides` has a range of `1.91` to `1472.3`. Though the minimum values between these targets are quite similar, the maximum and the mean of the targets value are quite different.\n\n### 3.1.1 Quick view\nBelow is the first 5 rows of train dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T07:26:48.755422Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T07:26:48.755847Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T07:26:48.783951Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T07:26:48.755808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T07:26:48.782701Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dimension and number of missing values in the train dataset is as below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Number of rows: {train_df.shape[0]};  Number of columns: {train_df.shape[1]}; No of missing values: {sum(train_df.isna().sum())}')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.067525Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.067923Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.074861Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.067891Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.074Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The train dataset has `7,111` of rows with `12` of columns and there is `0` missing values which is good as there will be no additional steps needed to fill the missing value.\n\n### 3.1.2 Data types\nExcept `date_time` column, all of the other columns are in `float64` type.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.dtypes","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.426242Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.426858Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.435824Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.42682Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.434861Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.3 Basic statistics\nBelow is the basic statistics for each variables which contain information on `count`, `mean`, `standard deviation`, `minimum`, `1st quartile`, `median`, `3rd quartile` and `maximum`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.describe()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.756444Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.757031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.812831Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.756975Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T07:26:49.811676Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"3.2\"></a>\n## 3.2 Test dataset\nTest dataset is used to make a prediction based on the model that has previously trained.

Positive correlation: `sensor_1 and sensor_2`, `sensor_1 and sensor_5`, `sensor_2 and sensor_4`, `sensor_2 and sensor_5`. \n- Some of the features correlation between train and test are different due

The test is starting from `winter` to `spring`, while the train is starting from `spring` to `winter`.
