{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Simple MLP for March Madness Predictions 🏀🏀🏀\n\nIn this notebook, I predict March Madness scores by utilizing a combination of feature engineering and neural networks! This notebook includes a simple neural network which is trained a large amount of somewhat related data, and an advanced neural network which is trained on a small amount of related data. I'll cover the preprocessing, implementations, predictions, and strengths/weaknesses of each model, as well as explain more of my thought process and steps as the notebook progresses, so without further ado, let's begin!\n\nNote: You can follow along with the code even if you don't know basketball very well; however, there are some nuances in the feature engineering which involve some knowledge of basketball (references are provided though). I also use the terms neural network, NN (short for neural network), and <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/neural-networks-crash-course/\">MLP</a> (short for multilayer perceptron) interchangeably throughout this notebook.\n\n**If you are interested in using your code to generate results which you can use to fill out your March Madness bracket, check out my related notebook <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/generate-a-march-madness-bracket\"><strong>here</strong></a>!**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Essential Imports\n\nNote, not every import is used here; this is just a convenient template I like to use (+ it doesn't hurt to have additional imports here)!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#-----General------#\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport random\n\n#-----Plotting-----#\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\n\n#-----Utility-----#\nimport itertools\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nimport re\nimport gc\n\n#-----DS Packages-----#\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_addons as tfa\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold, StratifiedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold, KFold, train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr, spearmanr\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport keras\nimport keras.layers as layers\n\n#-----Random Keras Stuff for Quick Implementation-----#\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Dropout\nfrom keras.regularizers import l2\nfrom keras.initializers import GlorotNormal\nfrom keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n\nSEED = 42\nrandom.seed(SEED)\nnp.random.seed(SEED)\ntf.random.set_seed(SEED)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load in the Data\n\nFor this notebook, I use only 4 out of the 20 csv files provided.
