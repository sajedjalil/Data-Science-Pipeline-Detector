After using a series of simple transformations to create new features, I use a logistic regression model with a l1 regularization parameter to indentify the most useful features. Feel free to skip to the conclusion where I discuss the results of the kernel and to use any of the new features in your own models. The kernel is organized as follows.\n\n* [Introduction](#intro)\n* [Feature Generation](#featgen)\n* [Feature Selection](#featsel)\n* [Submission](#sub)\n* [Conclusion](#conc)\n\n<div id=\"featgen\"><hr></div>\n\n## Feature Generation\n\n### Facial Landmarks\n\nThe first set of features will stem from facial landmark coordinates calculated using Dlib's face detector and facial landmark predictor. I initialized the predictor with weights pretrained on the iBUG 300-W dataset, available for research purposes only, which can be downloaded [here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2). In order to speed up the execution and elevate the readability of this kernel I have calculated the coordinates for every image in the training and testing data in a seperate kernel. For more information on DLib and the example code that I used, visit the [facial landmark tutorial from pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/). Beyond the raw coordinates, I will create features based on the distance to the average point, distances from points on a person's face, and distances from points across faces.\n\n#### Raw Coordinates\n\nDLib's facial landmark predictor generates 68 points across a person's face. There are 9 specific landmarks: the jawline, left eyebrow, right eyebrow, nasal ridge, nasal tip, left eye, right eye, outer lips, and inner lips, with a variable number of points for each. I have named each point in a landmark-point-axis format (Ex: jaw0X, lipOut11Y), with point numbers in the order shown below (image courtesy of [ibug](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/)):\n<img src=\"https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/images/annotpics/figure_68_markup.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n<br>\nI have already calculated the landmark coordinates for every image so here I load the required packages and read in the csv file.

Cutting down the computational time and power needed to train a model may be essential for industry applications or to beat Kaggle's 6 hour runtime limit. Using fewer observations is one way to accomplish this, but doing so may cause models to overfit. Trimming features, however, can be done in such a way that model performance is largely unaffected, with much lower computational requirements. A smaller, concentrated group of powerful features may be just as effective as a larger, noisier group. I will use Lasso regularization within a logistic regression model to identify meaningful features. According to the [Stanford Statistics Department](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso.html):\n> Lasso is a shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. It minimizes the usual sum of squared errors, with a bound on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. \n\nI have chosen Lasso because it tends to prefer solutions with fewer non-zero features compared to other regularization techniques like Ridge or Elastic-Net. Before we can train our model we need to complete just a few data-cleaning tasks.\n\n### Scaling\n\nLogistic regression models benefit greatly from normalized data, so it is neccessary that I scale the features I have created. Most of the features are already fairly normal, as you can see below, so I will use a basic z-score scaler in scikit's StandardScaler.

From the beginning, errors with Dlib's pretrained models have forced me to throw away valuable data and blindly guess on around 1% of the test cases. By implementing a more accurate facial recognition model, that problem could be solved. I noted earlier that my data collection process was flawed; a more robust method could be devised. I declined to focus on these issues and others because they effect more the competition score rather than my high level analysis of feature generation. With this kernel I seek not to win the competition but to learn and create.\n\nRegardless of the overall competition score, the question is: which features were strong and worth investigating further and which features are of little use. Here I will show and discuss general trends and only a few of the top features, but I will create a .csv file with all of the features and their respective coefficients for further examination.\n\n#### Coefficient Spread\n\nI examine the features by dividing them into three groups: those that were reduced to zero by Lasso, those in the top-250 that were selected to train on the secondary model, and those in the middle that contribute only weakly. I define the 'influence' or 'strength' of a feature by the absolute value of its coefficient because the coefficient determines the feature's effect on the model's prediction. Below I create those three divisions as well as write a .csv file with all the features and coefficients for your further reference."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"feature_coeffs = pd.DataFrame()\nfeature_coeffs[\"feature\"] = landmark_data.columns[:-1]\nfeature_coeffs[\"coefficient\"] = logReg.coef_[0]\nfeature_coeffs.to_csv('feature_coefficients.csv', index=False)\n\nsorted_coeffs = feature_coeffs.reindex(feature_coeffs.coefficient.abs().sort_values(ascending=False).index)\n\nzero_coeffs = feature_coeffs[feature_coeffs[\"coefficient\"]==0]\nbest_coeffs = sorted_coeffs.iloc[0:250,:].reset_index(drop=True)\nmiddle_coeffs = sorted_coeffs.iloc[250:len(feature_coeffs.index)-len(zero_coeffs.index),:]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plots below show the distribution of coefficients across the three catagories for each type of feature.

While the 'Distance to the Avergae Point' features and VGGFace embeddings have largely mediocre strengths, the raw coordinates and point to point distances have a lot of bad features and a lot of strong features.
