Conifers, such as pine (Pinus), spruce (Picea) and juniper (Juniperus), have narrow leaves, some have needles\nNorway Spruce, [Picea abies, branch, needles]\nBlue Atlas Cedar, [Cedrus atlantica ‘Glauca’, branch comparison]\nand others have scale-like leaves,\nIncense Cedar, [Calocedrus decurrens, branchlets]\nWestern Red Cedar, [Thuja plicata, branchlet and leaves].\n\nSo we propose a vein feature using skeletal information."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"846d7af6-a984-e7f8-0359-0b5ad7ec9ef0"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport scipy.ndimage as ndi\nfrom skimage.morphology import skeletonize\nfrom skimage import measure\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array\n\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e2958852-266f-65a6-3028-e0c035a68e03"},"source":"Reading the image a random"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a4b9c79b-23ad-b0d9-0c84-6ff84aa7eaed"},"outputs":[],"source":"# ------------------ Init ----------------------------------\n#img = mpimg.imread('../input/images/53.jpg')\nimg = load_img('../input/images/317.jpg', grayscale=True)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dfb9edbd-09b6-9000-4cc4-fbb69df2fdc4"},"source":"Idea: extract the veins of the leaf to see any consistencies by using recursive erosion to obtain the skeleton of the leaf"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"da733274-e2d8-aeaa-5a5f-f768a35de61d"},"outputs":[],"source":"max_ax = max((0, 1), key=lambda x: img.size[x])\nscale = 500 / float(img.size[max_ax])\nimg = img.resize((int(img.size[0] * scale), int(img.size[1] * scale)))\nimg = img_to_array(img)\nimg = np.around(img / 255.0)\nprint(img.shape)\n# --------------------------------- Feature Extraction -------\n#img = np.divide(img,np.max(np.max(img)))\nimg = img.squeeze()\nskeleton = skeletonize(img)\nprint(type(skeleton))\nprint(img.shape)\nprint(skeleton.shape)\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0e16f4ea-badd-9d74-4a0c-52066e2aca5f"},"source":"Showing the vein structure of the leaves"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"56124964-7806-e37d-cb5c-d9f1cf748f1f"},"outputs":[],"source":"# --------------------------------- Display The Results -------\n# display results\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4.5), sharex=True, sharey=True, subplot_kw={'adjustable':'box-forced'})\n\nax1.imshow(img, cmap=plt.cm.gray)\nax1.axis('off')\nax1.set_title('original', fontsize=20)\n\nax2.imshow(skeleton, cmap=plt.cm.gray)\nax2.axis('off')\nax2.set_title('skeleton', fontsize=20)\n\nfig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.02, hspace=0.02, top=0.98,\n                    bottom=0.02, left=0.02, right=0.98)\n\nplt.show()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c84019e8-a5d7-2ccf-8ec7-09ce46bbe317"},"source":"This is a good start but we need to fine tune this in order to extract meaningful information such as the number of pits of the leaves.
