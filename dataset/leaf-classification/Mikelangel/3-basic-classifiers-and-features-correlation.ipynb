Dropping them would lead to a modest loss of information. Moreover, the actual value of the importance is increased for the first ten vectors and equally low for the last ten.  \nIt is interesting to note how this rearrangement of the information through **PCA** and the elimination of just one descriptor doesn't significantly affect the results for the **Random Forest** classifier.
