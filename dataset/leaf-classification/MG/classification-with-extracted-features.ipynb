The data contains three files of pre-extracted feature vectors used in the published paper. The data also contains black and white leaf images which allows feature extraction for model building.\n### I will first prepare the pre-extracted features and use them as a benchmark in model building. \n### I will mainly focus on extracting features from the images and test whether and how they can be used for model building.\n### Although this project didn't use the data on kaggle, it is highly related to the classification task assigned here. I upload my notebook here in case that you are interested. \n### Comments are welcomed.\n###https://github.com/vradore/python_data/blob/master/UCI_plant_leaves/species_classification_MGu_final.ipynb","outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"version":"3.6.1","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"},"nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
