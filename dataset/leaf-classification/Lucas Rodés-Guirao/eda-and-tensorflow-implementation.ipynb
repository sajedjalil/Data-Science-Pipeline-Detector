A Feed Forward Neural Network is a Neural Network that is built by _layers_. Each layer consists of a set of units (often refered to as _neurons_). Particularity of these networks is that units within the same layer do not interact between each other. The following figure illustrates the architecture of these networks\n\n![](http://cse22-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp4/images/structure.png)\n\nThe input layer is where we introduce the training data. In this first attempt, we will use the feature vectors. Thus, the input layer has 192 units. In Classification problems, the _output layer_ has as many units as classes we have in our problem (in our case, we have 99). In between, we have the _hidden layers_ (the number of hidden layers might vary from task to task). \n\nIn general, at each layer these networks compute linear combinations of the output vector of the previous layer and subsequently apply non-linearities (also known as activation functions). In our case, we will be using the ReLu activation function, which has been proven in the literature to be robust to the vanishing gradient problem and has a faster convergence than other standard activation functions (e.g. sigmoid, tanh).\n\nIn the following, we initialise the model parameters and define the network architecture."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ac7f3c17-14fc-48b0-f0da-a4df4c66f59f"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Parameters\nlearning_rate = 0.0001\ntraining_epochs = 200\nbatch_size = 10\ndisplay_step = 10\n\n# Network Parameters\nn_features = 192\nn_classes = 99\nneurons_layers = [n_features, 256, 512, 256, n_classes] # Number of features in input, hidden and output layers\n\n# Load Train data\ntrain_data = {}\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\") # Load training set\ntmp = df.as_matrix()\ntrain_data['samples'] = tmp[:, 2:] # Obtain all the feature vectors (without ids and species)\ntrain_data['labels'] = tmp[:, 1] # Obtain labels (i.e. species)\nN_train = len(train_data['samples']) # Number of training samples\n\n# Obtain list of features\nfeatures = list(df)\ndel(features[:2]) # Delete id and species from features\n\n# Load Test data\ntest_data = {}\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/test.csv\")\ntmp = df.as_matrix()\ntest_data['samples'] = tmp[:, 1:]\ntest_ids = df.pop('id')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"068ff5e7-8538-39da-e73c-616c2b07d414"},"source":"The label of the samples comes as string format.
