Both are wonderful approaches to the carvana challenge and I was very inspired from their code to make mine. \n\n\n## Why creating another kernel then?\n\nI found Heng CherKeng kind of an experimental playground and I wanted to have a clear and straightforward code written for Pytorch that I can refer to later in time.\nThe goal of this kernel is not to burst public/private lb score but rather to understand how Unets works using Pytorch.\nIt has a clear and well documented code and takes the learning path approach. Of course I'll add more and more improvements to it to eventually reach the top results (on 31-08-2017 it reaches 0.987 on public LB). Anyone who's willing to help is welcome to open PRs on the github repo. I engage myself to review and merge them.\n\nDon't hesitate to upvote the kernel if you found it useful. My motivation comes from it.\n\n**Here is the [link to the github repository](https://github.com/EKami/carvana-challenge)**","cell_type":"markdown"}],"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4}
