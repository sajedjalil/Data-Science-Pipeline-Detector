{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>\n<p>Recruit Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service) and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).</p>\n<p>Recruit Holdings wants to expand its service offering by providing a prediction of the number of visitors for individual restaurant. Restaurants can benefit from the accuracy of ordering supplies and proper staffing decisions. For Recruit Holdings it means higher customer retention rate and improving competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to propose Data analysis solution to support Recruit Holdings in achieving its goals.</p>\n<h1>THE SOLUTION</h1>\n<p>Data analysis solution comprises of the following steps:</p>\n<h2>Cleaning and preparing data</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing required data set.</li>\n<li>Removing outliers (number of visitors that are unusually high and could be due to one-time event or technical issue)</li>\n<li>Analyzing and filling in missed data with values which are the most possible for a particular restaurant. We have filled in missing data based on the following assumption: number of visitors to each restaurant for each day is equals to the average number of visitors to restaurants in the same area and with the same genre. This number should be adjusted to the size of the restaurant, which we define as the average number of visitors to that restaurant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Data analysis includes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Simple and straightforward method</i>, which could be implemented by the on-site expertise. This simple method is based on the following algorithm: A number of visitors on prediction day will be equal to the average number of visitors on the same day of the week during the last year. If prediction day is a holiday, the number is equal to the average number of visitors on the holidays during last year.</li>\n<li><i>Advanced method</i>, which requires utilization of 3rd party library and possible future 3rd party technical support. For an advanced method, we considered [Prophet](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/method) as the more suitable approach to the required task. This is set of the open-source pieces of software developed by [Facebook's Core Data Science team.](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science)</li>\n<li>Comparing accuracy estimate for both methods</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purpose of making a prediction, there is no need to collect reservation data. </li>\n<li>The Simple method shows a decent accuracy of data prediction, while easy to implement and support in the future product. Simple method does not take into account seasonal changes.</li>\n<li>The Advanced method improves the accuracy of forecasting by about 6%. However, requires the utilisation of 3rd party library and proper onsite expertise to update model and support it in the future. The Advanced method uses additional information on the number of visitors few days after and/or before holidays. The appropriate expertise of the person who knows visitors behavior during Japanese holidays has to be used to improve accuracy. One year of historical data is not enough to statistically identify visitors behavior before and/or after different kind of holidays.</li>\n<li>The accuracy of both methods will be improved when data for few years will be available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>RECOMENDATION</h1>\n<p>If Recruit Holdings has already the proper expertise to implement and support the advanced method, then we recommend to use it. If not, Recruit Holdings has to take into account the cost of implementation and future support of the advanced method and make cost/benefit decision on what to use.</p>\n<h1>RATIONALE</h1>\n<h2>Cleaning and preparing data </h2>\n<h3>Import required libraries</h3>\n<p> Anywhere further in the text press <b>Code</b> button if want to see actual code and/or <b>Output</b> button if you want to see the output.

Based on this work, we could see that many advanced methods considered there are very close in terms of the accuracy. However, we think that [Prophet](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/method) as the more suitable approach to the required task. This is set of the open-source pieces of software developed by [Facebook's Core Data Science team.](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science)\n<p>Prophet utilizes an additive regression model which decomposes a time series into</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the linear/logistic trend,</li>\n<li>a yearly seasonal component,</li>\n<li>a weekly seasonal component, and</li>\n<li>an optional list of important days (such as holidays, special events, &hellip;).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This tool is backed by Facebook brand and presumably employs work of the world&rsquo;s best data scientist.</p>\n<p>It fits our purposes because it was originally designed to forecast data based on the time series and correctly handle data around holidays. If we assume that visitor&rsquo;s behavior is different during holidays, as well as a few days before and after Holidays, then Prophet will handle this irregularity scientifically correct.</p>\n<h3>Holidays classification</h3>\n<p>Let us assume that visitor’s behavior is different for different holidays. Unfortunately, we have only 1 year of historical data and hence, we have only 1 day of representation of each holiday. This is not enough to predict data reliably in the future. To increase statistical representation of each holiday, we need to classify holidays and split them into groups. Each group would consist of holidays where restaurant’s visitor's behavior are similar. This way, we would collect more data for each group of holidays.</p>\n<p>We have manually converted date_info file into Prophet’s format and have assigned meaningful names for each holiday. We had to do so manually because, we have to track different kind of holidays separately from each other. Unfortunately information about holidays names are not present in the date_info file.</p>\nPlease see below Prophet’s holiday’s definition file. According to Prophet Requirements, we have to identify how many days visitor's behavior is different before and after each holiday.
