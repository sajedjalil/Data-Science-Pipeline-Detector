It provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model, through the proportion of explained variance.                         \nAs such variance is dataset dependent, R² may not be meaningfully comparable across different datasets. Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R² score of 0.0.\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2568/1*pKx5cF_Fx6nco2KNowSuvA.png\" alt=\"MAE\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\nIn Sklearn implemented function: *sklearn.metrics.r2_score*\n\n* **Mean Absolute Error** - a risk metric corresponding to the expected value of the absolute error loss or l1-norm loss.

To make sure you have the best picture of your data, you'll want to separate long-trends and seasonal changes from the random fluctuations. In this part, we'll describe some of the time smoothers commonly used to help you do this.\n\n* **Moving averages**       \n\nThe easiest local smoother to grasp intuitively is the moving average (or running mean) smoother. It consists of taking the mean of a fixed number of nearby points. As we only use nearby points, adding new data to the end of the time series does not change estimated values of historical results.              \nLet’s start with a naive hypothesis — “tomorrow will be the same as today”, but instead of a model like *ŷ(t)=y(t−1)* (which is actually a great baseline for any time series prediction problems and sometimes it’s impossible to beat it with any model) we’ll assume that the future value of the variable depends on the average *n* of its previous values and therefore we’ll use moving average.\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\nUnfortunately we can’t make this prediction long-term — to get one for the next step we need the previous value to be actually observed. But moving average has another use case — smoothing of the original time series to indicate trends. Pandas has an implementation available *DataFrame.rolling(window).mean()*.

In the case of the very noisy data, which can be very often encountered in finance, this procedure can help to detect common patterns.","attachments":{"image.png":{"image/png":"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

The interval has an associated confidence level, or coverage that, loosely speaking, quantifies the level of confidence that the deterministic parameter is captured by the interval. More strictly speaking, the confidence level represents the frequency (i.e. the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level.\n\nThe confidence level is designated prior to examining the data.

That is cool, but it is also not enough. Let's extend exponential smoothing so that we can predict two future points (of course, we will also include more smoothing).            \n\nSeries decomposition will help us - we obtain two components: **intercept (i.e. level)  ℓ  and slope (i.e. trend)  b** . We have tried to predict intercept (or expected series value) with previous methods; now, we will apply the same exponential smoothing to the trend by assuming that the future direction of the time series changes depends on the previous weighted changes. As a result, we get the following set of functions:\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1783/1*ws6cwxbpczBgTGYEZep79Q.png\" alt=\"exp smoothing 2\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\nAs a result we get a set of functions. The first one describes intercept, as before it depends on the current value of the series, and the second term is now split into previous values of the level and of the trend.

Holt-Winters**\n\nWe've looked at exponential smoothing and double exponential smoothing. This time, we're going into triple exponential smoothing.\n\nAs you could have guessed, the idea is to add a third component - **seasonality**. This means that we should not use this method if our time series is not expected to have seasonality. Seasonal components in the model will explain repeated variations around intercept and trend, and it will be specified by the length of the season, in other words by the period after which the variations repeat. For each observation in the season, there is a separate component: for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.\n\nWith this, let's write out a new system of equations:\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2153/1*tQUjJKDKmqjGPeQ9YqV_dQ.png\" alt=\"exp smoothing 2\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\nThe intercept now depends on the current value of the series minus any corresponding seasonal component. Trend remains unchanged, and the seasonal component depends on the current value of the series minus the intercept and on the previous value of the component. Take into account that the component is smoothed through all the available seasons; for example, if we have a Monday component, then it will only be averaged with other Mondays. Now that we have the seasonal component, we can predict not just one or two steps ahead but an arbitrary  m  future steps ahead, which is very encouraging.\n\nBelow is the code for a triple exponential smoothing model, which is also known by the last names of its creators, Charles Holt and his student Peter Winters. Additionally, the Brutlag method was included in the model to produce confidence intervals:\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2053/1*6Cu5nv-COdclmdfXnAU02Q.png\" alt=\"exp smoothing 2\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\nwhere  T  is the length of the season,  d  is the predicted deviation.

Then using cross-validation we will evaluate our chosen loss function for given model parameters, calculate gradient, adjust model parameters and so forth, bravely descending to the global minimum of error.\n\nThe question is how to do cross-validation on time series, because, you know, time series do have time structure and one just can’t randomly mix values in a fold without preserving this structure, otherwise all time dependencies between observations will be lost. That’s why we will have to use a bit more tricky approach to optimization of the model parameters: **“cross-validation on a rolling basis”**.\n\nThe idea is rather simple — we train our model on a small segment of the time series, from the beginning until some t, make predictions for the next t+n steps and calculate an error. Then we expand our training sample until t+n value and make predictions from t+n until t+2∗n, and we continue moving our test segment of the time series until we hit the last available observation. As a result we have as many folds as many n will fit between the initial training sample and the last observation.

You can see this visually on the pictures from the post of  [Sean Abu](http://www.seanabu.com/2016/03/22/time-series-seasonal-ARIMA-model-in-python/):\n\n* The mean of the series should not be a function of time. The red graph below is not stationary because the mean increases over time. alt text\n\n<img src=\"http://www.seanabu.com/img/Mean_nonstationary.png\" alt=\"1\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n\n* The variance of the series should not be a function of time. This property is known as homoscedasticity. Notice in the red graph the varying spread of data over time. alt text\n\n<img src=\"http://www.seanabu.com/img/Var_nonstationary.png\" alt=\"cross-validation on a rolling basis\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n\n* Finally, the covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice the spread becomes closer as the time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time for the ‘red series’.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.seanabu.com/img/Cov_nonstationary.png\" alt=\"cross-validation on a rolling basis\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n\nSo why stationarity is so important? Because it’s easy to make predictions on the stationary series as we assume that the future statistical properties will not be different from the currently observed. Most of the time series models in one way or the other model and predict those properties (mean or variance, for example), that’s why predictions would be wrong if the original series were not stationary. Unfortunately most of the time series we see outside of textbooks are non-stationary but we can (and should) change this.\nSo, to fight non-stationarity we have to know our enemy so to say. Let’s see how to detect it. \n\nThere are two ways you can check the stationarity of a time series. The first is by looking at the data. By visualizing the data it should be easy to identify a changing mean or variation in the data. For a more accurate assessment there is the **Dickey-Fuller test**.\n\n### Dickey-Fuller test\n\nThe main idea of the Dickey-Fuller test for the stationarity of time series is fact of presence of a unit root. If we can get stationary series from non-stationary using the first difference we call those series integrated of order 1. Null hypothesis of the test — time series is non-stationary, was rejected on the first three charts and was accepted on the last one. We’ve got to say that the first difference is not always enough to get stationary series as the process might be integrated of order d, d > 1 (and have multiple unit roots), in such cases the augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used that checks multiple lags at once.\n\nWe can fight non-stationarity using different approaches — various order differences, trend and seasonality removal, smoothing, also using transformations like Box-Cox or logarithmic."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def tsplot(y, lags=None, figsize=(12, 7), style='bmh'):\n    if not isinstance(y, pd.Series):\n        y = pd.Series(y)\n    with plt.style.context(style):    \n        fig = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\n        layout = (2, 2)\n        ts_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (0, 0), colspan=2)\n        acf_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (1, 0))\n        pacf_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (1, 1))\n\n        y.plot(ax=ts_ax)\n        ts_ax.set_title('Time Series Analysis Plots')\n        smt.graphics.plot_acf(y, lags=lags, ax=acf_ax, alpha=0.5)\n        smt.graphics.plot_pacf(y, lags=lags, ax=pacf_ax, alpha=0.5)\n\n        print(\"Dickey-Fuller test criterion: p=%f\" % sm.tsa.stattools.adfuller(y)[1])\n\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        \n    test = sm.tsa.adfuller(y)\n    print('adf: ', test[0])  \n    print ('p-value: ', test[1])\n    print('Critical values: ', test[4])\n    if test[0]> test[4]['5%']: \n        print('A unit root is present, series are not stationary') \n    else:\n        print('No unit roots are present, series are stationary') \n    return \n\ntsplot(datehist.store_id, lags=30)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The test confirmed the assumptions about the unstationary of the series.

Both of them base on two of the following simple models:\n* **AR(p)** — autoregression model, i.e., regression of the time series onto itself. Basic assumption — current series values depend on its previous values with some lag (or several lags). The maximum lag in the model is referred to as p. To determine the initial p you need to have a look at PACF plot — find the biggest significant lag, after which most other lags are becoming not significant.\n* **MA(q)** — moving average model. Without going into detail it models the error of the time series, again the assumption is — current error depends on the previous with some lag, which is referred to as q. Initial value can be found on ACF plot with the same logic.\n\nIf we combine AR and MA models we'll get **ARMA(p,q)** model - **Autoregressive–moving-average model**.              \n\nThen, adding new components to ARMA model we comes to **ARIMA(p,d,q)** - **Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average**, which knows how to handle non-stationary data with the help of nonseasonal differences. In an ARIMA model we transform a time series into stationary one(series without trend or seasonality) using differencing. \n\n* **I(d)** — order of integration. It is simply the number of nonseasonal differences needed for making the series stationary. In our case it’s just 1, because we used first differences.\n\n**Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models**:\nAs the name suggests, this model is used when the time series exhibits seasonality. This model is similar to ARIMA models, we just have to add in a few parameters to account for the seasons.\n\n* **S(s)** — this letter is responsible for seasonality and equals the season period length of the series\n\nSo we write SARIMA as ARIMA(p,d,q)(P, D, Q)m:                 \np — the number of autoregressive                  \nd — degree of differencing                     \nq — the number of moving average terms                    \nm — refers to the number of periods in each season                           \n(P, D, Q )— represents the (p,d,q) for the seasonal part of the time series\n\nNow that we know how to set the initial parameters, let's have a look at the final plot once again and set the parameters:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tsplot(data_diff1, lags=30)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* p  is most probably 6 since it is the last significant lag on the PACF, after which, most others are not significant.\n* d  equals 1 because we had first differences\n* q  should be somewhere around 6 as well as seen on the ACF\n* P  might be 3, since 7-th and 15-th lags are somewhat significant on the PACF (lets the season be 7)\n* D  again equals 1 because we performed seasonal differentiation\n* Q  is probably 5.

Thus, we need to first obtain the residuals of the model and construct an ACF for them, and then apply the test to the resulting coefficient. \n\n**The Ljung–Box test** (named for Greta M. Ljung and George E. P. Box) is a type of statistical test of whether any of a group of autocorrelations of a time series are different from zero and instead of testing randomness at each distinct lag, it tests the \"overall\" randomness based on a number of lags, and is therefore a portmanteau test.\n\nThe Ljung–Box test may be defined as:\n\n* H0: The data are independently distributed (i.e. the correlations in the population from which the sample is taken are 0, so that any observed correlations in the data result from randomness of the sampling process).\n* H1: The data are not independently distributed; they exhibit serial correlation.              \nThe test statistic is:\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb68b5d73ab4813712778e246303961ae48d6190\" alt=\"The Ljung–Box stats\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\nFor significance level α, the critical region for rejection of the hypothesis of randomness is: <img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2aa39af3127113dd435272f4117a64bdd431593d\" alt=\"The Ljung–Box stats\" style=\"width: 120px;\"/>\n\nWith statsmodels this can be done as follows:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Firstly let's inspect the residuals of the model.\ntsplot(best_model.resid[7+1:], lags=30)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is clear that the residuals are stationary, and there are no apparent autocorrelations."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#  resid, хранит остатки модели, qstat=True, означает что применяем указынный тест к коэф-ам\n# Calculate the autocorrelation function.\nq_test = sm.tsa.stattools.acf(best_model.resid[7+1:], qstat=True) \nacf_scores = pd.DataFrame({'Q-stat':q_test[1], 'p-value':q_test[2]})\nacf_scores","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The value of these statistics and p-values indicate that the hypothesis of the randomness of residues is not rejected, and most likely this process represents \"white noise\".                       \nNow let's calculate the *coefficient of determination R²* to understand what percentage of observations this model describes.

If it is undesirable to explode a dataset by using many dummy variables that can lead to the loss of information and if they cannot be used as real values because of the conflicts like \"0 hours < 23 hours\", then it's possible to encode a variable with slightly more interpretable values. The natural idea is to encode with the mean value of the target variable. In our example, every day of the week and every hour of the day can be encoded by the corresponding average number of ads watched during that day or hour. It's very important to make sure that the mean value is calculated over the training set only (or over the current cross-validation fold only) so that the model is not aware of the future."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def code_mean(data, cat_feature, real_feature):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary where keys are unique categories of the cat_feature,\n    and values are means over real_feature\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(data.groupby(cat_feature)[real_feature].mean())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"average_wd = code_mean(data, 'weekday', \"y\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))\nplt.title(\"Weekday averages\")\npd.DataFrame.from_dict(average_wd, orient='index')[0].plot()\nplt.grid(True);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Finally, let's put all the transformations together in a single function .\ndef prepareData(series, lag_start, lag_end, test_size, target_encoding=False):\n    \"\"\"\n        series: pd.DataFrame\n            dataframe with timeseries\n\n        lag_start: int\n            initial step back in time to slice target variable \n            example - lag_start = 1 means that the model \n                      will see yesterday's values to predict today\n\n        lag_end: int\n            final step back in time to slice target variable\n            example - lag_end = 4 means that the model \n                      will see up to 4 days back in time to predict today\n\n        test_size: float\n            size of the test dataset after train/test split as percentage of dataset\n\n        target_encoding: boolean\n            if True - add target averages to the dataset\n        \n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # copy of the initial dataset\n#     data_timeidx = datehist.set_index('visit_date_full')    \n    data = pd.DataFrame(series.copy())\n    data.columns = [\"y\"]\n    \n    # lags of series\n    for i in range(lag_start, lag_end):\n        data[\"lag_{}\".format(i)] = data.y.shift(i)\n    \n    # datetime features\n    data.index = pd.to_datetime(data.index)\n    data[\"weekday\"] = data.index.weekday\n    data['is_weekend'] = data.weekday.isin([5,6])*1\n    # List of public and common local holidays in Japan\n    holidays = pd.to_datetime(pd.Series(['01.01.2016', '02.01.2016', '03.01.2016', '11.01.2016', '11.02.2016', '03.03.2016', '20.03.2016', '21.03.2016', \\\n               '29.04.2016', '03.05.2016', '04.05.2016', '05.05.2016', '07.07.2016', '18.07.2016', '11.08.2016', '19.09.2016', \\\n               '22.09.2016', '10.10.2016', '03.11.2016', '15.11.2016', '23.11.2016', '23.12.2016', '25.12.2016', '31.12.2016', \\\n               '01.01.2017', '02.01.2017', '03.01.2017', '09.01.2017', '11.02.2017', '03.03.2017', '20.03.2017', '29.04.2017']))\n    data['is_holiday'] = data.index.isin(holidays)*1\n    \n    if target_encoding:\n        # calculate averages on train set only\n        test_index = int(len(data.dropna())*(1-test_size))\n        data['weekday_average'] = list(map(code_mean(data[:test_index], 'weekday', \"y\").get, data.weekday))\n\n        # drop encoded variables \n        data.drop([\"weekday\"], axis=1, inplace=True)\n    \n    # train-test split\n    y = data.dropna().y\n    X = data.dropna().drop(['y'], axis=1)\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = timeseries_train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size)\n\n    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"datehist_timeidx = datehist.set_index('visit_date_full')\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = prepareData(datehist_timeidx.store_id, lag_start=7, lag_end=22, test_size=0.3, target_encoding=True)\n\nX_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\nlr = LinearRegression()\nlr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n\nplotModelResults(lr, X_train=X_train_scaled, X_test=X_test_scaled, plot_intervals=True, plot_anomalies=True)\nplotCoefficients(lr)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Fighting Overfitting\nWhat we can see on the lower plot is some **overfitting**! Lag_7 feature was so great in the training dataset that the model decided to concentrate all of its forces on it. As a result, the quality of prediction, still not too high, dropped. This problem can be solved in a variety of ways; for example, we can calculate the target encoding not for the whole train set, but for some window instead. That way, encodings from the last observed window will most likely better describe the current series state. Alternatively, we can just drop it manually since we are sure that it makes things only worse in this case."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Regularization and feature selection\nAs we already know, not all features are equally healthy - some may lead to overfitting while others should be removed. Besides manual inspection, we can apply regularization. Two of the most popular regression models with regularization are Ridge and Lasso regressions. They both add some more constrains to our loss function.\n\nIn the case of Ridge regression, those constraints are the sum of squares of the coefficients multiplied by the regularization coefficient. The bigger the coefficient a feature has, the bigger our loss will be. Hence, we will try to optimize the model while keeping the coefficients fairly low.\n\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d92ca2429275bfdc0474523babbafe014ca8b580\" alt=\"L2\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n\nIn L2 regularization, regularization term is the sum of square of all feature weights as shown above in the equation. As a result of this  L2  regularization, we will have higher bias and lower variance, so the model will generalize better (at least that's what we hope will happen).\n\nThe second regression model, Lasso regression, adds to the loss function, not squares, but absolute values of the coefficients. As a result, during the optimization process, coefficients of unimportant features may become zeroes, which allows for automated feature selection. This regularization type is called  L1.\n\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dfef9f9ff9b5a18268107c5b9f2f1e9640cfa750\" alt=\"L1\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n\nFirst, let's make sure that we have features to drop and that the data has highly correlated features."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))\nsns.heatmap(X_train.corr());","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV, RidgeCV\n\n# Perform Ridge (L2) regression\nridge = RidgeCV(cv=tscv)\nridge.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n\nplotModelResults(ridge, X_train=X_train_scaled, X_test=X_test_scaled, plot_intervals=True, plot_anomalies=True)\nplotCoefficients(ridge)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ridge.alpha_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lasso = LassoCV(cv=tscv)\nlasso.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n\nplotModelResults(lasso,  X_train=X_train_scaled, X_test=X_test_scaled,plot_intervals=True, plot_anomalies=True)\nplotCoefficients(lasso)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lasso.alpha_ ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lasso regression turned out to be more conservative; it removed weekday_average from the most important features and dropped 9 features completely, which only made the quality of prediction better."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## XGboost\nIn the end, lets try XGboost to our data:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from xgboost import XGBRegressor \nxgb = XGBRegressor(booster='gblinear', alpha=11, updater='coord_descent', feature_selector='greedy', top_k=7)\nxgb.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\nplotModelResults(xgb,  X_train=X_train_scaled, X_test=X_test_scaled,plot_intervals=True, plot_anomalies=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see from the plots and scores, our model builds a quite good forecast for some, not far, future.
