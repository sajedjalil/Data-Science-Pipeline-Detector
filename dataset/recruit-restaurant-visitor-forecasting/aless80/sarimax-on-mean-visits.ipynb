In that case use differentiation: create a new series y with the first difference y=x$_t$-x<sub>t-1</sub> (this is the \"I\" in ARIMA models), and take seasonal differences (which you can account for in ARIMA model).  \nChanges is variance mean that oscillations change. To fix this a log of the series compresses oscillations.  \nChanges in autocorrelation means that oscillations become broader (or narrower). If you have this I think you are screwed..\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test helps us deciding whether a series is stationary. The test's null hypothesis is that the series is non-stationary. If the Test Statistic output of the Dickey-Fuller test is less than the Critical Value, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the series is stationary.  \nBelow we notice that the original time series (using the mean of visits) is fairly stationary: Test Statistic=-3.796104 > Critical Value (1%) = -3.444615. Applying 1st or seasonal differentiation greatly improves the test results (Test Statistic = -6.608968 and 7.196314, respectively). A weekly periodic structure is clearly visible in the data, so I lean towards using seasonal differentiation. \nTakign the log of the data helps but does not seem to be a main factor in improving stationarity.

in the competition, but the aic Akaike information criterion estimating the quality of the statistical model is also plotted. The two scores seem to be in reasonable agreement.  \nInterestingly, 1st differentiation (the second 'd' hyperparamenter) does not seem to be necessary to obtain a good model. This confirms the analysis above. Because overdifferentiating is bad, I will stick to d=0: **( , 0, )x( , 1, , 7)**.   \nAlthough I do not show it the second to last term (SMA) is important and should be at least 1: **( , , )x( , , 1, )**. When I evaluate models with SMA=0 they are always worse and show an ugly zig zag plot.  \nThe model we had from our analysis is **(2,0,2)x(0,1,1,7)**. Model **(2,0,2)x(1,1,1,7)** next to it in the plot has a slightly better Akaike Information Criterion score. Other models with more complexity (e.g. 2031117 or 3021117) are slightly better, but I'd rather keep the model simple.  \nI am tempted to choose model **(1,0,2)x(1,1,1,7)**, which is simpler and with a decent score. Probably in this model the first hyperparamenter AR=1 (instead of AR=2 from our analysis above) is compensated by the fourth hyperparamenter SAR=1 (instead of SAR=0 from our analysis). I will go for this model.   \n\nRunning SARIMAX **(1,0,2)x(1,1,1,7)**: the weekly oscillations are nicely captured but the autocorrelation plots show some structure in the residuals. Notice that in my plots predictions (green time series) are entirely calculated on untrained region of the plot so that I can estimate predictions and true values where they overlap. Training the model on the whole labels would lead to better match in the overlapping region but the model would be prone to overfitting.","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"source":"mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(air.visit_mean[:450], trend='c', order=(1,0,2), seasonal_order=(1,1,1,7))\nresults = mod.fit()\n#Predict on future data and on time periods already known for evaluation with RMSLE\npred = results.predict(start=450, end=516)\nprint(results.summary())\n#Plot\nplotSARIMAX(air.visit_mean, pred)","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"outputs":[]},{"source":"Adding 1st order differentiation does not work (you get nan coefficients, not shown)\n\n### SARIMAX with eXogenous dataset\n\nLet's introduce holidays in the fit.
