So hard, that few of us have done it. A bonus lesson could be helpful.\n\nThis is that bonus lesson.\n\nThis is not an official Kaggle offering. I am not associated with Kaggle staff and am learning right alongside of all the rest of you. I just really wanted a notebook like this, so I created it.\n\nI've spent a great deal of time and effort on the competitions associated with two (really great!) courses created by Ryan Holbrook:\n\n* [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)\n* [Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series)\n\nWhile you can read through the material and do the simple exercises in a couple days each, I think of Kaggle-style courses as an introduction giving you the minimum needed concepts and vocabulary to get started. You learn a lot more from applying what you learned to the accompanying competition data sets.\n\nThe [beautifully written code of the Feature Engineering bonus lesson](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook/feature-engineering-for-house-prices) makes it easy to jump right in and start applying every one of the course concepts to a complex data set. After I spent weeks experimenting with and expanding Ryan's bonus notebook, I published an [enhanced version of the feature engineering bonus lesson](https://www.kaggle.com/filterjoe/house-price-feature-engineering-using-only-xgboost).\n\nRyan does not currently have the time to create an official bonus lesson for the Time Series course (I asked). The intent of this unofficial bonus lesson notebook is the same as other Kaggle bonus lesson notebooks: to make it easy to jump in and start applying course concepts to a complex data set, without getting bogged down with days of coding/debugging before you can even get started.\n\nIt took me weeks and extensive debugging to get boosted hybrids (as explained in lesson 5) working in conjunction with multistep forecasting (as explained in lesson 6) for this competition data. A lot of what made it difficult was the multi-indexed nature of the data, which required lots of stacking, unstacking, and in general making sure at every step, the data was in the right format for the next step.\n\nAs a side effect of debugging, I discovered two major data issues:\n\n* The onpromotion data was not correct for both the test and train data sets. I informed Ryan and he corrected onpromotion values on 11/22/21.\n* Chunks of missing data before June 2015 are probably too extensive for imputation to be helpful. Therefore, training based on data before July 2015 may hurt your model. (Example: examine the plot for Store 1 Produce sales in 2015)\n\nIn the rest of this notebook I explain how to implement for this competition all the concepts we all learned from the Time Series course lessons and exercises. I skipped most EDA as it is covered well in many public notebooks (I want this project to be focused on the harder parts, and small enough that I publish it and maintain/improve it).\n\nI'm open to suggestions for how to improve this notebook. I am especially interested in learning if there are faster multi-step forecasting methods. This notebook can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to run - if you use 2 or more years of data combined with many features, it takes hours.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Getting Started ##\n\nJump right in and do the following (after forking this notebook):\n\n* Familiarize yourself with the two cells full of variables (just after imports)\n* To speed things up:\n    * Change full_train_start_day to a value that is just a few months earlier than full_train_end_day\n    * Set val_end_day to (2017, 8, 1)\n    * Optionally, to make it really fast, comment out all lag features and set hybrid_forecasting_type to \"direct\"\n* Run the notebook in interactive mode one cell at a time. As you're doing it:\n    * Add cells to examine variables\n    * Examine plots carefully (and rerun the plots on different store numbers and/or families if you like)\n\nOnce you feel comfortable playing around with variables and plots, make this notebook your own by adding and subtracting features. Read the commentary and comments throughout the notebook to see where and how to add and subtract features.\n\nIf you get into trouble, you can make use of certain print/display statements I used a lot when debugging, which are commented out by default.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pathlib import Path\nimport datetime\n\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, TimeSeriesSplit\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_squared_log_error\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.deterministic import CalendarFourier, DeterministicProcess\nimport pickle\n\nimport warnings\nfrom IPython import get_ipython\nget_ipython().config.InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\n# List input data files available in read-only \"../input/\" directory\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-23T01:44:19.524178Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-23T01:44:19.524738Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-23T01:44:19.540365Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-23T01:44:19.524687Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-23T01:44:19.539361Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After loading imports/configuration (above), it's convenient to set a few variables that will be used throughout the notebook, to reduce chance for careless errors and make it easier to conduct experiments:\n\n* **time variables** (which parts of time series data to use)\n* **choose models, max_lag**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# time variables (NOTE: use pre-June 2015 data cautiously as large chunks are missing)\n\n# data time range to train on the full training set\nfull_train_start_day = datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 16)\nfull_train_end_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 15)\n\n# data time range for train/validation split \ntrain_start_day = full_train_start_day\ntrain_end_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 30)\nval_start_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 31)\nval_end_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 15)\n# can be smart to set val_end_day to (2017, 7, 31) or (2017, 8, 1) when testing a change or debugging\n\n# data time range of test set\ntest_start_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 16)\ntest_end_day = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 31)\n\nif full_train_start_day > full_train_end_day:\n    raise ValueError(\"full_train_start_day must be less than full_train_end_day . . .

Those familiar with the grocery industry know that new stores are not \"mature\" when first opened.

So y_resid is part of the BoostedHybrid class. We need to split the fit method into two methods, fit1 and fit2. We run fit1 on X1 to generate y_resid, which is then available to create lag features for X2. After X2 features are created (including lag features using y_resid), fit2 can run.\n\nAlso, we need a way to deal with the NaNs that get created from lag features. In lesson 6, this is done by aligning two dataframes (shifting created mismatched indices). But if you do one-step forecasting over and over, and you keep aligning, then you'll effectively drop rows with each forecasting step. Instead, we can delay dealing with the NaN rows until the last instant, in the fit2 method of BoostedHybrid. Then, we can ignore the rows instead of dropping them. By doing it this way, the rows can be reused over and over for things like rolling averages or rolling means, rather than throwing out the earliest chunk of the data set with each step.\n\nSo that's what the max_lag variable is for: it's passed as first_n_rows_to_ignore so that the appropriate number of rows are ignored in fit2 and predict methods.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class BoostedHybrid:\n    def __init__(self, model_1, model_2):\n        self.model_1 = model_1\n        self.model_2 = model_2\n        self.y_columns = None\n        self.stack_cols = None\n        self.y_resid = None\n\n    def fit1(self, X_1, y, stack_cols=None):\n        self.model_1.fit(X_1, y) # train model 1\n        y_fit = pd.DataFrame(\n            self.model_1.predict(X_1), # predict from model 1\n            index=X_1.index,\n            columns=y.columns,\n        )\n        self.y_resid = y - y_fit # residuals from model 1, which X2 may want to access to create lag (or other) features\n        self.y_resid = self.y_resid.stack(stack_cols).squeeze()  # wide to long\n        \n    def fit2(self, X_2, first_n_rows_to_ignore, stack_cols=None):\n        self.model_2.fit(X_2.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore*1782: , :], self.y_resid.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore*1782:]) # Train model_2\n        self.y_columns = y.columns # Save for predict method\n        self.stack_cols = stack_cols # Save for predict method\n\n    def predict(self, X_1, X_2, first_n_rows_to_ignore):\n        y_pred = pd.DataFrame(\n            self.model_1.predict(X_1.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore: , :]),\n            index=X_1.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore: , :].index,\n            columns=self.y_columns,\n        )\n        y_pred = y_pred.stack(self.stack_cols).squeeze()  # wide to long\n#         display(X_2.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore*1782: , :]) # uncomment when debugging\n        y_pred += self.model_2.predict(X_2.iloc[first_n_rows_to_ignore*1782: , :]) # Add model_2 predictions to model_1 predictions\n        return y_pred.unstack(self.stack_cols)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-23T01:48:38.340697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-23T01:48:38.341032Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-23T01:48:38.352974Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-23T01:48:38.340985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-23T01:48:38.352126Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating X1 Features ##\n\nAfter setting up the complicated BoostedHybrid class, we can create features.

If you want to try different time ranges, change the time variables at the beginning of the notebook as they are referenced in a few different places.\n\nThere are many different possible forecasting methods. With this notebook you can choose one of three different methods (in variables section at the beginning), and they are applied the same way to the train/validation split as they are to the train/test split, to avoid data leakage.\n\nThe next 4 cells are:\n\n1. Preparation in common to all 3 methods.\n\n2. Direct method of forecasting. It's easy and fast. If you use it, comment out all lag features in make_X2_features.\n\n3. day_by_day_fixed_past method creates the forecast one day at a time so that the next day's lag can be calculated and used for following days. Each time a forecast is made, prior day forecasts are not touched - they are fixed.\n\n4. day_by_day_refit_all_days method also creates the forecast one day at a time so that the next day's lag can be calculated and used for following days. However, with each new forecast, the entire set of days (training days AND forecast days) are refitted. For a 16 day forecast, day one will therefore be forecast 16 different times, though the forecasts are only very slightly different with each iteration through the loop.\n\nPartly because the day-by-day methods are slow, a validation score is given after each round so you know something is happening. Perhaps you will choose to abort the run if validation scores are much higher than usual. The day-by-day methods also display (a portion of) the final prediction on the validation set, as it can be useful to review these numbers after a notebook is saved/committed.\n\nAs with any Kaggle competition, it's important to use an evaluation metric that is similar to the one used on the leaderboard.
