It was originally written by Tomoji Takasu of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, but there are now multiple forks available, including the demo5 fork which I maintain. When used to generate PPK (post-processing kinematic) solutions it has two advantages over the baseline solutions provided by Google.  First of all, it uses the carrier phase observations (ADR) as well as the pseduorange observations.  The carrier phase observations are more difficult to use but also have smaller errors than the pseudorange observations.  Secondly, the PPK solutions are differential, relative to a nearby known base location, rather than absolute like the Google solutions.  The differential solution allows us to difference raw observations between the rover and base which effectively cancels most of the satellite orbital, clock, and atmospheric errors, resulting in more accurate solutions.  \n\nI describe this process in more detail in [this blog post](https://rtklibexplorer.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/google-smartphone-decimeter-challenge/) in which I share my experience working with last year's GSDC data after the competition was over.  It includes a link to download the code I used to generate RTKLIB solutions for last year's data.  Submitting these solutions to Kaggle (after the competition was over) resulted in a score of 2.15 meters which put it into fifth place on the final Private Leaderboard.\n\nI would like to encourage use of RTKLIB in this year's competition and so I am sharing an updated version of the previous code to duplicate my results with this year's data and the most recent RTKLIB code. This code gives a set of solutions that score 3.135 on this year's Public Leaderboad.  The new code is only slightly modified from the previous version, so anyone interested in using RTKLIB for this challenge can start by becoming familiar with the previous code on the previous data.  I would strongly recommend starting with the older code and data because it comes as a complete package and is easier to get results with than what I am presenting here.\n\nMy hope is to provide a platform which will allow competitors to jump right into extending the existing GNSS theory rather than having to build a solution from scratch. In addition to the C version of RTKLIB I described in the above post, I have recently created an all python subset of RTKLIB for PPK solutions. This runs somewhat slower than the C code but does make an easier development platform. In this notebook I will provide code and guidelines for working with the C code version of RTKLIB.  I will also describe working with the Python version in a separate notebook after I complete this one.\n\nIn the interestes of getting this out sooner rather than later, this will not be the \"push the button and you get an answer\" kind of notebook.  It will be more like a set of handwritten notes scribbled down quickly while actually running the experiment.  In it's current form you will need to download the pieces of code to your own system, put them together and run locally since it relies on open source compiled code.  In the future I hope to make this more user friendly, but for now it is assumed that you are fairly familiar with python and can debug simple issues that may crop up when trying to follow these instructions.\n\nI ran this exercise on a Windows PC but you should be able to run it on linux as well.  In general, the top of each file will have a set of input parameters.  Unless your folder names and paths are identical to mine, you will often need to update these before running.\n\nThe folder structure I use in this solution is:\n\nGSDC_2022\n\n    config\n    \n    data\n    \n      test\n    \n      train\n      \n    python\n   \n      android_rinex\n      \n      rtklib-py\n      \n    rtklib\n\nIt will be easier to follow these instuctions if you use the same folder structure.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1: Retrieve base observation and satellite navigation files**\n\nSince these are differential solutions, we will need raw observation measurements from a nearby base station for each data set.  Fortunately, these are available from the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) website.  We will also need satellite orbital data for each data set for the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo constellations.  These are available from multiple websites.  I chose to retrieve them from the UNAVCO site, in part because these files include Galileo navigation data as well as GPS and GLONASS.  Some of the other sources include only GPS and GLONASS.\n\nLast year it was sufficient to use a single base station for every data set since they were all located in a small geographic area.  This year there are data sets from the Bay Area and from the LA area, so we will need to select the appropriate base station for each data set and also use the correct location for that base station in the solution.\n\nThe code below simply retrieves the base and navigation data for the full day corresponding to the starting time of each data set.  This works fine for the test data set since all data sets start and end on the same UTC day but but in the training set there are multiple data sets that start in one (UTC) day and finish in the next day.  I will be demonstrating this exercise on the test data so will not worry about this issue but if you are trying to retrieve this data for the training data you will either need to eliminate the multi-day sets or manually download a file with the correct starting and stopping times.  This is most easily done from the \"User Friendly CORS\" page on the NGS site.\n\nThe observation files are doubly compressed.  They first need to be decompressed with gzip and then with crx2rnx.  This second step translates from compressed rinex to uncompressed and requires an executable file from RTKLIB.\n\nYou can download the RTKLIB executables for Windows at https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB/releases.  Put them in the GSDC_2022/rtklib folder.  Note that these are for the demo5 fork of RTKLIB which I maintain.  You can use any fork of RTKLIB for this step, but later when we are calulating the solutions, you will need to use the demo5 fork.  If you are running in Linux, you will need to build your own executables from the source code.

If you want to duplicate this score exactly, you will need to use the most recent source code available at https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB and compile the rnx2rktp.exe app yourself.

I suspect it has some errors and ommissions so please let me know if you find any issues and I will make any necessary updates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Final thoughts**\n\nThe intent of this notebook is not to provide a fully optmized solution, but only to get you started with RTKLIB and demonstrate some of its capability.  \n\nFollowing these instructions will provide an improved baseline solution file which can be post-processed with filtering, map-matching, etc to give you a good jump on the competition. This alone, however, will probably not be enough to win the competion.  To do that I believe that you will need to improve the RKTLIB solution itself.  Some of this can be done by modifying the configuration file.  More dramatic changes will require modifying the code.  More information on the configuration file and the code algorithms are available in the [demo5 RTKLIB Users Manual](https://rtkexplorer.com/pdfs/manual_demo5.pdf), particularly section 3.5 and Appendix F for information on configuration, and Appendix E for information on the core algorithms.  More involved changes to the code can probably be done more easily in rtklib-py, the python version of RTKLIB.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to get you started.  Most of them do not require any modifications to the RTKLIB code, just the configuration file.\n\n1) **Raw measurement weighting.**  This solution uses only satellite elevation for weighting the input observations.  The code supports weighting with arbitrary combinations of elevation, signal strength, and receiver quality estimates.  Other research has shown that signal strength weighting should outperform elevation weighting for smartphone receivers.  The receiver accuracy estimates are also potentially valuable sources of information that is currently being discarded\n\n2) **Solution ensembles**:  In many cases you will find that adjusting the RTKLIB configuration parameters will improve some solutions and degrade others.  Weighted combinations of multiple solutions will likely out-perform any single solution.  I would recommend the variance based weighting used in my phone merge code example from last year (see link in the introduction).\n\n3) **Hardware clock discontinuites:** In this solution, the two datasets with clock discontinuties were simply replaced with the Google baseline solutions.  It should be possible to use RTKLIB to find an improvement over these.\n\n4) **Cycle slip detection/mitigation**:  This solution entirely ignores flags from the receiver indicating possible cycle slips.  Instead it relies on consistency checks to detect the cycle slips.  While ignoring the slips entirely works better than relying on them completely, there is valuable information being discarded here which could potentially improve the solution.\n\n5) **Tectonic plate movement:**  Base station movement due to tectonic plate movement is not fully accounted for in this solution and there may be some opportunity for improvement with more careful accounting.\n\n6) **IMU measurements:**  IMU measurements could be incorporated into the RTKLIB solution.  The solutions noticeably degrade when the vehicles are stationary due to increased multipath effects so the simplest solution would be to detect this state and respond accordingly.  More sophisticated approachs could take more advantage of this information.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions regarding RTKLIB.  I just ask that, to follow the rules of the competition, you ask your questions in the discussion group here so that the answers are available to all of the competitors.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
