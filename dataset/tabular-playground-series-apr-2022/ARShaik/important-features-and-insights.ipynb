Time series classification is very well known concept in  industry applications. The simplest example is doctor using stethoscope to hear the heart sound and get an indication of health issue. Another example is  ECG (electrocardiogram), which records the electrical activity of the heart and is widely be used to diagnose various heart problems.  ECG of the healthy person vs heart patient is shown below.\n\n<img src= \"https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5856087/bin/sensors-18-00379-g003.jpg\" alt =\"ECG\" style='width: 800px;'>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> 📌 As you can see above figure, the classification depends on features such as the length of the cycle, peak value and depression value. In our example also we might need to develop an model which can also capture such features</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n## <span style=\"color:crimson;\"> DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE IF YOU FIND IT USEFUL.......!!!!!! </span>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 69, 0, 0.5);border-radius:5px;display:fill\">\n    <h1><center> Quick summary of EDAs </center></h1>\n</div>\n<a id=\"2\"></a><h2></h2>\n<div style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 167, 255, 0.6);border-radius:10px;display:fill\">\n\nThe training dataset has 1558080 rows which consists of 25968 sequences. Each sequence consists of measurements at 60 different time steps. Our objective was to predict binary state for each sequence.  25968 binary states are provided in train lables csv file for training purposes.\n <br> \n##  Subject:  \n•\tThere are in total 991 subjects: 672 subjects in the train set and 319 subjects in the test set.  <br> \n•\tThe train and test subjects have completely different values, hence cannot be used as feature.  <br> \n•\tAs observed by @sytuannguyen subjects with more than 100 sequences have more than 80% of state 1. This is an great observation, if we can somehow materialize on it to predict the state. As @ambrosm suggested, it might be good idea to use GroupKFold cross-validation with the subjects as groups.  <br> \nSequence:  <br> \n•\tAs mentioned previously, there are in total 25968 sequences in training set. Each sequence consists of measurements at 60 different time steps.   <br> \n•\tAnother observation is that the number of sequences in each subject also can be used as a feature (@ambrosm). <br> \n\n##  Sensors:  <br> \n•\tIn total 13 different sensors are present in the present dataset. <br> \n•\tAlmost all the Kagglers are on the agreement that Sensor-2 is dominating when compared with other sensors. Mostly, Sensor-2 has discrete levels which changes level only from time to time.  <br> \n•\tOn the closer investigation, it has been noticed that each sensor data has outliers.  <br> \n•\tMost sensor features values have big amounts of zeros and they are not normally distributed except Sensor-12. <br> \n•\tAnother great observation by @ambrosm is, if a sensor has constant value for the whole sequence the most probable binary state is 0. <br> \n•\tSensor_08 has discrete values. <br> \n•\tA good observation by @ javigallego  is that Sensor 0, Sensor 6, Sensor 9, Sensor 3, Sensor 7 and Sensor 11 are correlated with each other. <br> \n### **Feature engineering of Sensor data is important aspect of this competition. Based on the public notebooks the following statistical information have high importance.** \n•\tSensor 0 ( standard deviation, interquartile range, kurtosis) <br> \n•\tSensor 1 ( mean, standard deviation, interquartile range, kurtosis) <br> \n•\tSensor 2 ( up mean, down mean, mean, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, sum, down sum, variation coefficient) <br> \n•\tSensor 3 (interquartile range) <br> \n•\tSensor 4 (mean, standard deviation, interquartile range, kurtosis, mutual information score)  <br> \n•\tSensor 5 (interquartile range) <br> \n•\tSensor 6 (interquartile
