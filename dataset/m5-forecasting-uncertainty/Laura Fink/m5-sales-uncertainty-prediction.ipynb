So far we haven't setup a model, but we can start easily using the naive method described in the competition guideline:\n\n$Y_{n+i} = Y_{n}$\n\nfor $i=1,2,...h$.\n\nIt's used for predicting series of the lowest level of the hierarchy. You can see that this approach just assumes the last known daily sale value for all requested predictions of the series. \n\n\n## Prediction intervals for the Naive method <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prediction_intervals_naive\"></a>\n\n\n### Assuming normally distributed forcasting errors\n\nBut how can we compute prediction intervals for this method? If we always assume the last known value for the next points of the time period with horizont h, there would be no distribution per time point that could tell us something about uncertainty. I really start to like [Forecasting - Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/). Take a look at the chapter [\"Prediction intervals\"](https://otexts.com/fpp2/prediction-intervals.html#prediction-intervals). Here we can read that one way to go is to assume normally distributed forcasting errors:\n\n$$\\epsilon(y) \\sim N(\\sigma_{h})$$\n\nwhereas $\\sigma_{h}$ stands for the estimated standard deviation of future time step h. A prediction interval is then computed as a multiple of this standard deviation:\n\n$$y_{lower, h} = y - c \\cdot \\sigma_{h}$$\n\n$$y_{upper, h} = y + c \\cdot \\sigma_{h}$$\n\nThe factor $c$ is called **multiplier** and often such values are used for the requested prediction intervals:\n\n* c = 2.58 for 99% PI\n* c = 1.96 for 95% PI\n* c ~ 0.95 for 67% PI\n* c = 0.67 for 50% PI\n\nIf you like to read more about prediction intervals, I found this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_interval) useful as well.\n\n### Prediction intervals for multi-step time horizonts\n\nIn our case we are asked to compute uncertainty estimates for a time period of 28 days. It's intuitive that our predictions become more uncertain the greater the time step $h$ of our time horizont. Therefore we can assume that $\\sigma_{h}$ increases with h. \n\n\nIn contrast to one-step predictions we can't just use the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of residuals $\\epsilon_{t} = y_{true, t} - y_{fitted, t}$ of all time points $t$ between our observations and fitted values of the training data. Instead we could use some common benchmark methods:\n\n* **Mean forcasts: $\\sigma_{h} = \\sigma \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{T}}$ **\n* **Naive forcasts:** $\\sigma_{h} = \\sigma \\cdot \\sqrt{h}$\n* **Seasonal naive forcasts:** $\\sigma_{h} = \\sigma \\cdot \\sqrt{k+1}$ with k as the integer part of $\\frac{(h-1)}{m}$ and $m$ as the seasonal period\n* **Drift forcasts:** $\\sigma_{h} = \\sigma \\cdot \\sqrt{h \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1+h}{T}\\right) }$\n\nIn these cases $T$ stands for the total time span in the training data and $h$ for our prediction time horizont (in our case 28 days). All methods assume that we have given uncorrelated residuals. Consequently we need to perform a residual analysis to check if this is true! :-) \n\n\nBut before doing so, we need to compute an example of the Naive method!

In my case, I have splitted the original training timeseries into my own eval and train part. Consequently instead of computing response series for the training data, we need to do this for the evaluation data.
