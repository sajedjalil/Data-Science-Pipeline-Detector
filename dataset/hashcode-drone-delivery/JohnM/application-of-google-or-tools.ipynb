Assignments are made product by product. Of course, any time we divide a problem into parts and optimize those parts, we are almost sure to suboptimize the overall objective. Still, it's a reasonable place to start.\n\nThere are different methods to use when tackling an assignment problem. Here I use the [minimum cost flow solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/flow/assignment_min_cost_flow) to assign warehouses. The basic idea is you have a network of nodes and edges. There's a notional source node, a set of worker nodes (warehouses), a set of task nodes (orders) and a notional sink node. Here's a generic view of such a network.\n\n![flow](https://i.imgur.com/u5jZYgv.png)\n\nThe link above has a good example. Here I use the SolveMaxFlowWithMinCost variation, which doesn't require supply and demand to be equal. That allows one to do away with source and sink nodes and simplify the network. It can also find a different optimum from the balanced min-cost solver, which may be better or worse for this challenge.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.06895,"end_time":"2020-10-04T17:38:38.007372","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-04T17:38:37.938422","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def assign_whs(supply, wh_locs, demand, cust_locs):\n    \"\"\"OR-tools function to assign warehouses to orders using a max-flow min-cost\n    solver.
