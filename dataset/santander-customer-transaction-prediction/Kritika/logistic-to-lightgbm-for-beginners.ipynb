So, to give you an example, random forests are ensembles of many decision tree estimators. \n\nThere are 2 types of ensemble learning algorithms -\n**1. Bagging Algorithms:** Bagging involves having each model in the ensemble vote with equal weight for the final output. In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the ensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set\n**2. Boosting Algorithms:** As Wikipedia defines, boosting involves incrementally building an ensemble by training each new model instance to emphasize the training instances that previous models mis-classified.\n\n## Random Forest\nLet's start with building a random forest, with parameters like class_weight, random_state, and hyperparameters like max_features and min_sample_leaf as earlier. We have also defined the n_estimators which is a compulsory parameter. This defines the number of decision trees that will be present in the forest.

It grows tree vertically while other algorithm grows trees horizontally meaning that Light GBM grows tree leaf-wise while other algorithm grows level-wise. Leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm.\n\n**WHY USE LGB?**\n\nIt is ‘Light’ because of its high speed. It can handle large data, requires low memory to run and focuses on accuracy of results. Also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists/ Kagglers are widely using LGBM for data science application development.\n\n**TIPS & TRICKS**\n\n* The algorithm easily overfits and thus, should not be used with small (< 10K rows) datasets.\n* Deal with overfitting using these parameters:\n    1. Small Maximum Depth\n    2. Large Minimum Data in a Leaf\n    3. Small Feature and Bagging Fraction\n* Improve the training speed\n    1. Small Bagging Fraction\n    2. Early Stopping Round \n* Use small learning_rate with large num_iterations for better accuracy\n* Ideally, the value of num_leaves should be less than or equal to 2^(max_depth). Value more than this will result in overfitting\n* **If you have a big enough dataset, use this algorithm at least once. It’s accuracy has challenged other boosting algorithms**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"70d1ec7daaaa24a657a35bd36cc4fd59667dde1c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#custom function to build the LightGBM model.\ndef run_lgb(X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, test_inp):\n    params = {\n        \"objective\" : \"binary\",\n        \"metric\" : \"auc\",\n        \"num_leaves\" : 1000,\n        \"learning_rate\" : 0.01,\n        \"bagging_fraction\" : 0.8,\n        \"feature_fraction\" : 0.8,\n        \"bagging_freq\" : 5,\n        \"reg_alpha\" : 1.728910519108444,\n        \"reg_lambda\" : 4.9847051755586085,\n        \"random_state\" : 42,\n        \"bagging_seed\" : 2019,\n        \"verbosity\" : -1,\n        \"max_depth\": 18,\n        \"min_child_samples\":100\n       # ,\"boosting\":\"rf\"\n    }\n    \n    lgtrain = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=Y_train)\n    lgval = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=Y_test)\n    evals_result = {}\n    model = lgb.train(params, lgtrain, 2500, valid_sets=[lgval], \n                      early_stopping_rounds=50, verbose_eval=50, evals_result=evals_result)\n    \n    pred_test_y = model.predict(test_inp, num_iteration=model.best_iteration)\n    return pred_test_y, model, evals_result\n\n# Training the model #\npred_test, model, evals_result = run_lgb(X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, test_inp)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b9d2922685dcd868df11569988f1b6d69abf6ff9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Light GBM Results:\nThe AUC Score drastically improves from 0.650 in our Decision Tree model to **an AUC score of 0.89** in our ensemble of trees, Light GBM model.
