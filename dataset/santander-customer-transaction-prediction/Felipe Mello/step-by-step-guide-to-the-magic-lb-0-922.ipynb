INTRODUCTION**\n\nIn this competition, the objective was to forecast which clients would make a specific transfer in the future. The data given was composed of 200.000 rows and 200 anonymized features.\n\nThe evaluation metric was ROC-AUC. In case you are not familliar with it, check it [here](https://medium.com/greyatom/lets-learn-about-auc-roc-curve-4a94b4d88152).\n\n**Context**:\nThis competition broke Kaggle's previous competitors record (around 6000), and became the most disputed competition ever in this platform, with over 9000 competitors. For many weeks, almost no team could surpass the 0.901 score barrier. So everyone started to look for the \"magic\".\n\n### **2. WHAT DIDN'T WORK**\n\nMany teams tried to explore the data in every possible way: Features operations (+,-,*,/,log,tanh,etc), distribution, probability, time series, target encoding, data rotation, genetic programming, oversampling, undersampling, different models....you get it. Absolutely nothing worked\n\nAfter 2 weeks trying everything, I got tired of working hard and decided to work smart, so this happened: I broke the 0.901 barrier.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmellomascarenhas/Kaggle/master/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place/pictures/0.902_score.png)\n\n### **3. WHAT WORKED**\n\n**WARNING:** Before you proceed, you should know that **the scores you will see won't match the ones described**. That's because I used a simple train_test_split to speed up this kernel, instead of kfolds.\n\n### **3.1. CV 0.902 - MAGIC IN 4 LINES**\n\nWhen I decided to work smart, I re-read relevant topics and kernels in this competition and made a list about the dos and donts expressed by other competitors (as you can see below). [Making a kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/felipemello/why-your-model-is-overfitting-not-making-progress) about my own failed experiments helped me realize why they were not working.\n\n**At this point, what did I know?**\n\n1) Regular transformations wouldn't work (many topics shared failed experiments). \n\n2) [The test dataset had fake data](https://www.kaggle.com/yag320/list-of-fake-samples-and-public-private-lb-split), and that was relevant.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmellomascarenhas/Kaggle/master/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place/pictures/kernel_comment_1.png)\n\n3) That [unique values](https://www.kaggle.com/triplex/more-unique-values-in-train-set-than-test-set) were, somehow, important.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmellomascarenhas/Kaggle/master/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place/pictures/kernel_comment_2.png)\n\nSo I decided to experiment with both of these ideas: I merged the train and test datataset without fake values, created new columns for each variable with the number of unique values in it, and trained my model. That was enough to break the 0.901. You can see this simples procedure below.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/test.csv') \n\n#1 set of fake data and 2 sets of true data, as mentioned above.\nsynthetic_samples_indexes = np.load('../input/fakedata/synthetic_samples_indexes.npy')\nprivate_LB = np.load('../input/fakedata/private_LB.npy')\npublic_LB = np.load('../input/fakedata/public_LB.npy')\n\n#Merge the train_df with the test_df true data\nfull = pd.concat([train_df, pd.concat([test_df.loc[private_LB], test_df.loc[public_LB]], sort = False)], sort = False)\n\n#Created new columns with the unique values count\nfor feat in ['var_' + str(x) for x in range(200)]:\n    count_values = full.groupby(feat)[feat].count()\n    train_df['new_' + feat] = count_values.loc[train_df[feat]].values\n    test_df['new_' + feat] = count_values.loc[test_df[feat]].values\n\nprint('full_df has {} rows and {} columns'.format(full.shape[0], full.shape[1]))\n\n#trained the model with LGB and submited.\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **3.2. CV 0.909 - SETTING FEATURE FRACTION TO 1**\n\nFeature fraction is a [parameter of the LGB model](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html). It goes from 0 to 1 and represents the percentage of the data that you will use on each iteration of the traning. My feature fraction was 0.3. When I set it to 1, the model was able to look at all the variables at once, and voilá: CV 0.909! \n\n**TIP**: Setting feature fraction to 1 is a great way to understand the impact of a new feature in your model.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmellomascarenhas/Kaggle/master/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place/pictures/909_score.png)\n\n\n### **3.3. CV 0.913 - MAKING MY JOB EASIER**\n\nAt this point, I had a problem to solve: Each new feature about values frequency only mattered for one other specific feature. My model, however, was checking all possible interactions between my 400 features and taking a **long time to run**. \n\nThis [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/ymatioun/santander-model-one-feature-at-a-time) was the perfect solution, when it proved that it was possible to train the model on each one of the variables separately and still achieve the same LB score. \n\nSo I decided train my model with 2 features at a time: The original one and an extra column with the unique values count.\n\n**RESULT: Less than 2 minutes to train my whole model (as opposed to over an hour) and CV of 0.913.

But, again, scalling values won't affect the way that LGB sees the model. This transformation just makes it more pleasent to our eyes. \n\n**Note:** If you wanna do it yourself, just get the ratio of the distances between the peaks of the distributions, multiply one of the distributions by this ratio and subtract the differente between peaks of distribution 1 and 2.\n\n#### **5.2. OPTIMIZE THE LGB PARAMETERS FOR EACH VARIABLE**\n\nSince we have 200 different models, instead of having one set of parameters for all variables, we could pick  a specific set of parameters that works best for them.\n\nI tried doing it, and saw my AUC falling back to 0.900. I am not sure why. Maybe its overfitting? I don't know if it is possible to do that, but if it is, I bet it could substantially increase the score.\n\n#### **5.3. OTHER STUFF**\n\n- Create NN to do ensembling;\n- Try to use pure probability, instead of the LGB, as it was done in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/modified-naive-bayes-santander-0-899) kernel. Another competitor reported a 0.922 LB score using this technic and a gold medal;\n- Applied augumentation, as described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jiweiliu/lgb-2-leaves-augment).\n\nHowever, there is only so much you can do in 4 days.\n\n\n### 6. SUMMARY\n\nThank you for your attention. I hope you had fun. In this kernel we saw that:\n- Smart work is better than hard work. It is faster and produces better results;\n- If you think rationally about things, understand your model and your data, you can quickly improve your results;\n- There is a lot more to explore in the data;\n\n**If you liked the kernel, please, consider upvoting. It is the way to best reward the hours I put making this kernel. Thanks :)**\n\n### MY FINAL RUN WITH 4 FOLDS"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"param = {'bagging_fraction': 0.5166,\n   'bagging_freq': 3,\n   'lambda_l1': 3.968,\n   'lambda_l2': 1.263,\n   'learning_rate': 0.00141,\n   'max_depth': 3,\n   'min_data_in_leaf': 17,\n   'min_gain_to_split': 0.2525,\n   'min_sum_hessian_in_leaf': 19.55,\n   'num_leaves': 20,\n   'feature_fraction': 1,\n   'save_binary': True,\n   'seed': 2319,\n   'feature_fraction_seed': 2319,\n   'bagging_seed': 2319,\n   'drop_seed': 2319,\n   'data_random_seed': 2319,\n   'objective': 'binary',\n   'boosting_type': 'gbdt',\n   'verbosity': -1,\n   'metric': 'auc',\n   'is_unbalance': True,\n   'boost_from_average': 'false',\n   'num_threads': 6}\n\n#-------------Trains and predict-----------\nfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=4, shuffle=False, random_state=2319)\ntarget = train_df['target']\ny_hat = np.zeros([200000, 200])\ntest_hat = np.zeros([200000, 200])\ni = 0\nfor feature in ['var_' + str(x) for x in range(200)]: # loop over all features\n    print(feature)\n    feat_choices = [feature, 'new_' + feature]\n    oof = np.zeros(len(train_df))\n    predictions = np.zeros(len(test_df))\n    for fold_, (trn_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(folds.split(train_df[feat_choices].values, target.values)):\n        #print(\"Fold :{}\".format(fold_ + 1))\n        trn_data = lgb.Dataset(train_df.iloc[trn_idx][feat_choices], label=target.iloc[trn_idx])\n        val_data = lgb.Dataset(train_df.iloc[val_idx][feat_choices], label=target.iloc[val_idx])\n        clf = lgb.train(param, trn_data, 126, valid_sets = [trn_data, val_data], verbose_eval=-1)\n        oof[val_idx] = clf.predict(train_df.iloc[val_idx][feat_choices], num_iteration=clf.best_iteration)\n        predictions += clf.predict(test_df[feat_choices], num_iteration=clf.best_iteration) / folds.n_splits\n    print(\"CV score: {:<8.5f}\".format(roc_auc_score(target, oof)))\n    \n    y_hat[:, i] = oof\n    test_hat[:, i] = predictions\n    i += 1\n\n#--------------Calculate the weight importance of each feature----------\nweights = []\nfor col in range(200):\n    if roc_auc_score(target, y_hat[:,col]) >= 0.5:\n        weights.append(roc_auc_score(target, y_hat[:,col]))\n    else:\n        weights.append(0)\n        \nweights = np.array(weights)\nweights = (weights - weights.mean()) / weights.mean()\nweights += 1\n\n\n#-------------Get the test prediction-----------------------------\nsub_preds = (y_hat*weights).sum(axis=1)/200\nprint('Your CV score is', roc_auc_score(target, sub_preds))\n\nsub_preds_test = (test_hat*weights).sum(axis=1)/200\nsub = pd.DataFrame({\"ID_code\": test_df.ID_code.values})\nsub[\"target\"] = sub_preds_test\nsub.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
