Scikit-Optimize and Hyperopt) for my model.  <br> \n\n**The goal is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future and maximize the evaluation function (AUC)**\n<br> <br>\n\n# **Special Thanks to:** <br> \n\nI recommend you to see  [Fayzur's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/fayzur/lgb-bayesian-parameters-finding-rank-average) and [sz8416's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/sz8416/simple-bayesian-optimization-for-lightgbm) if you are interested in seeing what other people have done.

[(source)](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introductory-example-of-bayesian-optimization-in-python-with-hyperopt-aae40fff4ff0)<br> It is very effective with real-world applications in high-dimensional parameter-tuning for complex machine learning algorithms. Bayesian optimization utilizes the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and\ncombining it with evidence to get a posterior function. I attached one graph that demonstrates Bayes’ theorem below. <br> <br>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12-768x475.jpg\"  alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n<br> <br> \n The prior belief is our belief in parameters before modeling process. The posterior belief is our belief in our parameters after observing the evidence.\n<br> Another way to present the Bayes’ theorem is: \n\n<img src=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/Bayes_0.png\"  alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> <br> \n\nFor continuous functions, Bayesian optimization typically works by assuming the unknown function was sampled from a Gaussian process and maintains a posterior distribution for this function as observations are made, which means that we need to give range of values of hyperparameters (ex. learning rate range from 0.1 to 1).  So, in our case, the Gaussian process gives us a prior distribution on functions. Gaussian process approach is a non-parametric approach, in that it finds a distribution over the possible functions \nf(x) that are consistent with the observed data. Gaussian processes have proven to be useful surrogate models for computer experiments and good\npractices have been established in this context for sensitivity analysis, calibration and prediction While these strategies are not considered in the context of optimization, they can be useful to researchers in machine learning who wish to understand better the sensitivity of their models to various hyperparameters. [(source)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf)\n\n<br>\n**Well..why do we care about it?** <br> \nAccording to the [study](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/bergstra13.pdf), hyperparameter tuning by Bayesian Optimization of machine learnin models is more efficient than Grid Search and Random Search. Bayesian Optimization has better overall performance on the test data and takes less time for optimization. Also, we do not need to set a certain values of parameters like we do in Random Search and Grid Search. For Bayesian Optimization tuning, we just give a range of a hyperparameter. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"44e3d052e7977441be8ce913532021d36e902884"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n# **Loading Library and Dataset**\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#basic tools \nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\n\n#tuning hyperparameters\nfrom bayes_opt import BayesianOptimization\nfrom skopt  import BayesSearchCV \n\n#graph, plots\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#building models\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score\nimport time\nimport sys\n\n#metrics \nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, roc_curve\nimport shap\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"de9279f02cb62dab5f485b915225730f2e0177f7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By Changing the data type of each column, I reduced memory usages by 75%.
