This is an attempt to improve over the [Gaussian naive Bayes classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/blackblitz/gaussian-naive-bayes).\n\nWe implement the radius neighbors naive Bayes model to predict Santander Customer Transaction Prediction data. The problem has a binary target and 200 continuous features, and we assume that these features are independent. We model the target $Y$ as Bernoulli, taking values $0$ (negative) and $1$ (positive). The features $X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}$ are modelled as continuous random variables. Recall the Bayes rule:\n\n$$p_{Y|X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}}(y|x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{199})=\\frac{p_Y(y)\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y)}{\\sum_{y'=0}^1p_Y(y')\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y')}$$\n\nThe trick is to directly approximate the posterior given each feature $p_{Y|X_i}(y|x_i)$ and rewrite the above rule in the following form:\n\n$$p_{Y|X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}}(y|x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{199})=\\frac{p_Y(y)\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y)}{\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i}(x_i)}=\\frac{\\prod_{i=0}^{199}p_{Y|X_i}(y|x_i)}{(p_Y(y))^{199}}$$\n\nThe first equality is becuase of the assumption that the features are (unconditionally) independent and the second equality is obtained by applying Bayes rule to each feature and substituting $\\frac{f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y)}{f_{X_i}(x_i)}=\\frac{p_{Y|X_i}(y|x_i)}{p_Y(y)}$.\n\nWe can use a similarity-based method to estimate the posterior probabilities given each feature $p_{Y|X_i}(y|x_i)$ and plug into the above formula to get the posterior probabilities given all the features $p_{Y|X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}}(y|x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{199})$. However, this step is not legal since we are using approximate values in the Bayes rule instead of computing from a fully specified model. The output is not guaranteed to satisfy the axioms of probability so we need to normalize in the end. This hack enables us to avoid the curse of dimensionality at the expense of the independence assumption."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.style.use('bmh')\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 10)\ntitle_config = {'fontsize': 20, 'y': 1.05}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ba25820d572526ce3bba5d41b8b96ec7e468c19a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2421eca7931cd349dd31f9e814ec4c4d5e13e0ef"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train = train.iloc[:, 2:].values.astype('float64')\ny_train = train['target'].values\nX_test = test.iloc[:, 1:].values.astype('float64')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"db58f1f6ac1eefe98a95a55b92767f7f6132a804"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Implementing the Model\n\nWe will use the proportion of the classes as the prior $p_Y(y)$ and the proportion of radius neighbors as the approximate posterior given each feature $p_{Y|X_i}(y|x_i)$.

Otherwise, the posterior probability is set as the prior probability.\n* [numpy.searchsorted](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html) (which uses binary search) is used to look up the probability and the update rule is applied to obtain the posterior probabilities given all the features.\n* Since the radius neighbors is just an approximation, the output is not an true probability - it can violate the axioms of probability (exceeding one and not summing to one).

It has the advantage that it is more flexible and does not require that the data come from a normal distribution. The only assumption is that the features are independent. This is an unusual Bayesian method since we do not specify the likelihood model. The calculations are approximate so the outputs need to be renormalized. If we want to specify a likelihood model based on the data, we can use the Gaussian mixture model (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blackblitz/gaussian-mixture-naive-bayes) for implementation) or kernel density estimation to model the likelihood distribution. Whichever method we use, the goal is to have a model that is simple (easily understood), tractable (easily computed) and accurate (represents reality very well)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
