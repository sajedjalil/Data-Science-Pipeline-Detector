We model the target as unknown $Y$ and the features as observation $X$. The prior $p_Y(y)$ reflects our knowledge about the unknown before observation. In this problem, $Y$ is Bernoulli (only two classes) so it can be specified by setting the positive probability, which is usually set as the proportion of the positive class in the data. The likelihood $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$ models the distribution of the observation given that we know the class. The posterior $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$ is our updated knowledge about the unknown after observation.\n\nThe MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimator picks the class with the highest posterior probability. For binary classification, it has the same effect as setting a threshold of $0.5$ for the positive posterior probability. The LMS (Least Mean Squares) estimator $\\mathbf E[Y|X]$ picks the mean of the posterior distribution. For binary classification, this is just the positive posterior probability $p_{Y|X}(1|x)$, which is what we need to submit for the competition.\n\nThe Bayes rule for this problem is of the form\n$$p_{Y|X}(y|x)=\\frac{p_Y(y)f_{X|Y}(x|y)}{\\sum_{y'}p_Y(y')f_{X|Y}(x|y')}$$\n\nHere $X$ represents a sequence of 200 observations $X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}$. We assume that the likelihood distributions are normal and independent. This gives us the Gaussian naive Bayes classifier (Gaussian means normal and naive means independent):\n$$p_{Y|X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{199}}(y|x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{199})=\\frac{p_Y(y)\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y)}{\\sum_{y'=0}^1p_Y(y')\\prod_{i=0}^{199}f_{X_i|Y}(x_i|y')}$$\n\nNote that we only require 1 number for the prior and 800 numbers for the likelihood (200 sample means and variances for each of the two classes). \"Fitting\" is just computing those numbers, and \"predicting\" is carried out according to the above formula (although we need to operate on the log scale because multiplying many small numbers poses a problem when our machine has limited precision). It is a very simple and efficient model."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"875ac77cd013673a37fbc1048b6912d86844eb24"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Checking Assumptions\n\nThe classifier has already been implemented by scikit-learn, so we can use it right away.

This is because the normality and independence assumptions are closely followed by the data. We have seen that even if the data have been generated by independent normal distributions (according to the model trained on transformed data), we cannot get a better AUC. However, there may still be some other transformation that can improve our model. In my opinion, the normality assumption is not very realistic since some features seem to have lower and upper bounds.\n\nOne can also remove the assumptions and try to use density estimation techniques to model the likelihood distributions. KDE is not very tractable on data of this size. We can also use a Gaussian mixture model or a multivariate normal distribution with the sample covariance matrix from the data. In my experience, they give better training AUC but worse cross-validation AUC. The Gaussian naive Bayes classifier (improved a little bit by quantile transformation) is currently the best Bayesian model for the data.
