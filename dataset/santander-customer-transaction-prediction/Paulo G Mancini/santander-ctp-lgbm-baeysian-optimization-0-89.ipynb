It has one binary objective: given a person's known data, is he or she going to make a specific transaction? (yes/no). We need an algorithm to predict that. To create/ train/ test our algorithm we are provided 2 .csv files. They have enough entries, lots of variables and no labels. \n\n*The fun part:* there are no labels for the variables on the datasets, so we need to find other strategies than business logics to see which ones are relevant to the prediction or not. Which means going all in with math and model resources.  \n\n*The not so fun part:* by not knowing the labels of variables, we lose interpretability, and therefore we can’t take any insight of the analyses.\n\n*The cool part:* lots of people have already done this challenge, so we will find no trouble looking for reference. And our job becomes to read, understand, and incorporate it with our personal knowlege added, focusing on making it better.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"cell2\"></a>\n# Loading and Exploring the Data\n\nAs said, we are provided 2 .csv files for this challenge.
