The other reason for releasing this kernel near the end of the competition is that I have not been able to devote that much time to look at other promising methods/discussions that have been shared in this competition so far. So, I hope people can use this new method in their models and learn something new in the process.\n\n## What is binning?\n\nFeature binning is a method of turning continuous variables into categorical variables. This is accomplished by grouping the values into a pre-defined number of bins. The continuous value then gets replaced by a string describing the bin that contains that value.\n\n## What is Bayesian Block Binning?\n\nBayesian blocks is essentially a method creating histograms with bin sizes that adapt to the data. I am going to quote the whole post from this [link](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python/). Please feel free to go through either posts to understand more about Bayesian Blocks. \n\nI have given a working example of using bayesian blocks at the end of this kernel. You might want to run this kernel on your own machine because of the use of Multiprocessing framework.\n\nTo illustrate that, let's look at some sampled data. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define our test distributions: a mix of Cauchy-distributed variables\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nx = np.concatenate([stats.cauchy(-5, 1.8).rvs(500),\n                    stats.cauchy(-4, 0.8).rvs(2000),\n                    stats.cauchy(-1, 0.3).rvs(500),\n                    stats.cauchy(2, 0.8).rvs(1000),\n                    stats.cauchy(4, 1.5).rvs(500)])\n\n# Truncate values to a reasonable range:\nx = x[(x > -15) & (x < 15)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, what does this distribution look like?

But having to choose the bin width each time we plot a distribution is not only tiresome, it may lead to missing some important information in our data. In a perfect world, we'd like for the bin width to be learned in an automated fashion, based on the properties of the data itself. There have been many rules-of-thumb proposed for this task (look up Scott's Rule, Knuth's Rule, the Freedman-Diaconis Rule, and others in your favorite statistics text). But all these rules of thumb share a disadvantage: they make the assumption that all the bins are the same size. This is not necessarily optimal. But can we do better?\n\nScargle and collaborators showed that the answer is yes. This is their insight: **For a set of histogram bins or blocks, each of an arbitrary size, one can use a Bayesian likelihood framework to compute a fitness function which only depends on two numbers: the width of each block, and the number of points in each block. ** The edges between these blocks (the change-points) can be varied, and the overall block configuration with the maximum fitness is quantitatively the best binning."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Simple, right?\n\nWell, no. The problem is, as the number of points N grows large, the number of possible configurations grows as $2^N$. For N=300 points, there are already more possible configurations than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe! Clearly an exhaustive search will fail in cases of interest. This is where dynamic programming comes to the rescue.\n\n### Dynamic Programming\n\nIn our Bayesian Blocks example, we can easily find the optimal binning for a single point. By making use of some mathematical proofs concerning the fitness functions, we can devise a simple step from the optimal binning for $k$ points to the optimal binning for $k + 1$ points (the details can be found in the appendices of the Scargle paper). In this way, Scargle and collaborators showed that the $2^N$ possible states can be explored in $N^2$ time.\n\n### Algorithm:\n\nThe resulting algorithm is deceptively simple, but it can be proven to converge to the single best configuration among the $2^N$ possibilities. Below is the basic code written in python. Note that there are a few details that are missing from this version (e.g. priors on the number of bins, other forms of fitness functions, etc.) but this gets the basic job done:\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def bayesian_blocks(t):\n    \"\"\"Bayesian Blocks Implementation\n\n    By Jake Vanderplas.
