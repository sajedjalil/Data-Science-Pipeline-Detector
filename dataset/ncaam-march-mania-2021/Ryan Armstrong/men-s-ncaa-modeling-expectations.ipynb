The red lines are the true losses calculated using [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mmotoki/men-s-march-madness-2021-leaderboard-analyzer). Note that the true losses fall squarely within the distribution of expected losses. When this same exercize is done with a leaky model the true losses can end up being far lower than the modeled losses. In reality, the true outcome was highly unlikely given the model and that is because the model is actually based upon the true outcome as opposed to being a good predictive model!\n\nMore helpful would be to be able to quantify how likely it is that the true log losses could have come from the expected distribution. In theory, if we had a large sample of true losses we would like them to mimic the distribution of the expected losses. In the example above the true losses are confined to a narrow range, which might suggest that our model is still not accurately characterizing the probabilities. Because we only have 5 test seasons in this case it is hard to distinguish whether the distribution is by chance or if they are actually different.\n\n## Quantifying the relationship between true and modeled losses\n\nI had been thinking of a valid method to quantify the relationship between the modeled losses and the true losses. Per the suggestion of @goodspellr, below I use a [Kolmogorov–Smirnov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) test the hypothesis that the true losses were drawn from the distribution of the modeled losses (i.e. the modeled losses could be valid model of the tournament). @Goodspellr points out in [this comment](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021/discussion/224698#1233172) that each tournament may need a separate cumulative distribution function to describe the modeled losses. In order to accurately compare the 5 tournaments the exceedance value is calculated for each true loss using the estimate of the modeled losses for that year. All 5 exceedance values are then compared to a uniform distribution for the KS-test. In this case the p-value is greater than any reasonable significance threshold we could choose."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"statistic, pvalue = kstest(rvs=probs, cdf='uniform')\n\nprint(f'D-value of KS-test: {statistic}\\nP-value: {pvalue}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Some other theoretical examples\nWe can also make a couple theoretical examples to see what we know **isn't** reality.
