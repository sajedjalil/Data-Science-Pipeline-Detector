Essentially, all players start at the same number of elo rating points (usually 1500). As they play games, they earn points for beating other players and lose points when they lose games. They get more points from beating opponents with higher ratings and lose more points for losing to lower rated opponents. \n\n\nThis same methodology can be applied to college basketball. We can create elo ratings for teams. The nice thing about this system, is that from teh elo ratings you can get predicted win probability between two opponents. \n\n\nRather than create the elo ratings ourself, there are some great places online that have already constructed them.

To do this, we create distributions of expected scores for each team and then randomly sample from these distributions. When the expected score of team 1 is higher than team 2 in a given simulation, we award team 1 a win and vice versa. If we do this enough times we can get the expected win probabiltiy when the teams play.\n\nIt should be noted that this approach will not guarantee stable results. By definition there is randomness, so each run should be different than the previous ones. To solve for this, you can either set a random seed or  project the outcome out to infinity.\n\nOur methodology here is very basic. We want to simulate how two teams will perform against each other (team1 & team2). To simulate the score that team1 would have, we do the following:\n* sample from a distribution of past points scored by team 1\n* sample from a distribution of past points allowed by team 2 \n* take an average of points scored by team 1 & points allowed by team 2\n\nTo see who would win, we do the same for team 2 and compare the final result. I find this to be a decent basline model for evaluating performance that can be built upon. There are plenty of things wrong with this approach, but it is a good way to think about this problem and get started!
