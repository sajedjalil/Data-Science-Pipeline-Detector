These are long duration recordings, spanning multiple months up to multiple years and recording large numbers of seizures in some humans.\n\nIntracranial EEG (iEEG) data clips are organized in folders containing training and testing data for each human patient. The training data is organized into ten minute EEG clips labeled \"Preictal\" for pre-seizure data segments, or \"Interictal\" for non-seizure data segments. Training data segments are numbered sequentially, while testing data are in random order. Within folders data segments are stored in .mat files as follows:\n\n* I_J_K.mat - the Jth training data segment corresponding to the Kth class (K=0 for interictal, K=1 for preictal) for the Ith patient (there are three patients).\n* I_J.mat - the Jth testing data segment for the Ith patient.\n\nEach .mat file contains a data structure, dataStruct, with fields as follows:\n\n* data: a matrix of iEEG sample values arranged row x column as time sample x electrode.\n* nSamplesSegment: total number of time samples (number of rows in the data field).\n* iEEGsamplingRate: data sampling rate, i.e. the number of data samples representing 1 second of EEG data. \n* channelIndices: an array of the electrode indexes corresponding to the columns in the data field.\n* sequence: the index of the data segment within the one hour series of clips (see below). For example, 1_12_1.mat has a sequence number of 6, and represents the iEEG data from 50 to 60 minutes into the preictal data.

It also removes the DC component and then divides the Fourier amplitudes by the sum of the amplitudes. I think the DC removal and dividing by the sum are just data normalization (remove mean and make values go from -1 to +1). This prevents features from being considered more important in the analysis solely because they are at a larger scale.\n\nFourier Transforms are widely used in signals analysis. Usually, signals in the real world have complex shapes and are, therefore, difficult to describe mathematically. If it can't be described with an equation, then it is hard to analyze on a computer. \n\nThink about **clouds in the sky**. They are-- by definition-- nebulous. In order to point them out to another person, we typically find shapes and patterns within a completely random collection of water molecules. That one looks like a duck; this one looks like a rabbit; that one is a sailboat. The clouds of course are not these objects, but by approximating them with a well-known object we have any easier time with the analysis. We can say, \"Isn't the rabbit's left ear a little mishapen?\" And, everyone instantly knows where in the cloud to look.\n\n![alt-text](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMvb_ZsrmMw/hqdefault.jpg \"Clouds: Making shape out of form\")\n\nSimilarly, any signal-- no matter how complex-- can be thought of as the addition a collection of simpler (i.e. easier to describe mathematically) signals. You can pick any ensemble of signals (sine waves, traingular waves, polynomials, wavelets) to approximate a complex signal. \n\nFourier Transforms are the most commonly used because the mathematics of sine waves has been well studied and has some nice convenient properties that help process them more easily on a computer. Sine waves also give an idea of how quickly things are changing over time within a signal-- a concept gives us an intuitive insight into what information or processing is \"going on\" in the system being studied. We may even use a Fourier Transform to hypothesize there are separate components within the system. Filtering (i.e. separating) these components in the Fourier domain is easy and can even be done in realtime with hardware.\n\nFFTs are important in EEG pre-processing because it is believed that different frequency bands are correlated with different observable behaviors. For example, some frequency bands seem to distinguish awake versus sleeping. Others seem to be correlated with concentration and attention.

So truth time. \n\nFFTs can only get you so far in life because they assume that your system doesn't vary substantially with time. This is called [stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process). \n\nStationarity is a statistical concept which says that if I divide a signal up into smaller windows, then each windows's mean, standard deviation, and autocorrelation are about the same. (or, more formally, that the joint probability density function does not change when shifted in time-- whatever underlying process generating the signal at time t1 is exactly the same as at time t2) So, for example, [a pure tone at 40 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63lFYgEGT3k) will have the same mean and standard deviation (and other nth-order statistics) regardless of when you measure the signal. \n\nHowever, suppose you turn off the signal generator at some random times. Then, there would be periods with a 40 Hz signal interspersed with periods with no signal (and periods where the signal is ramping up or down while you flick the on/off switch). So the mean and standard deviation would vary over time because whatever is generating the signal changes over time. This is *non-stationarity*.\n\nIf the on/off periods were regularly spaced, then you could say that over longer intervals there was some predictable consistency-- so maybe some *quasi-stationarity*. In fact, many approaches to adjust for non-stationarity involve defining sliding windows that are considered to be quasi-stationary.\n\nReal world signals, such as EEG, often have some measure of nonstationarity. In fact, with EEG, we are assuming that the statistics of the signal will change between the ictal and iterictal states (hence the need for this Kaggle competition). \n\nHowever, the $20K question is really: What statistics change between these intervals and how can we best classify those differences?\n\nTo that end, the remaining functions in this feature extrator are looking at signal statistics that may change due to non-stationary effects. Again, all we are really doing at the end of the day is measuring things about the signal that we think may tell us something about how the underlying process changes. If we are lucky (or good; or both) we can find features that reliably and significantly change between the ictal and intraictal states."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0b83b82a-91f9-20db-5eec-98053806ccbd"},"source":"### Shannon Entropy\n\nEntropy is a non-linear measure quantifying the degree of complexity in a time series.

With a fractal, we take the object and see if we can divide it (or multply it) into objects that have exactly the same shape as the parent object, but are just at a different scale (or magnification).\n\nA square of length N, for instance, can be divided into $N^2$ smaller squares. Similarly, a box can be divided into $N^3$ smaller boxes. Or, another way to say it: If I were to divide a box by N, I would get exactly $N^3$ equal boxes the same shape, but N times smaller than the original box. \n\n_Let's take an example:_\n\nA cube of length 4 can be divided into $4^3 (= 64)$ unit (1x1x1 cubes)-- no less, no more. I can't get 65 cubes out of it or even 63 (unless I want the cubes to be of different sizes). Or, I could divide it by a magnification of 2 and get exactly $2^3 (=8)$ equal (smaller) cubes-- no less, no more. Or, a magnification of 3 and get-- you guessed it-- $3^3 (= 9)$ similar (smaller) cubes.\n\nSo *dimension* is actually the exponent of the ratio between the parent object and how many smaller (or larger) copies I can make.\n\n\n<center>$\\huge\\frac{log (\\text{number of self-similar pieces})}{log (\\text{magnification factor})}$</center>\n\nOr, for our test cube:\n\n<center>$\\huge\\frac{log(64)}{log(4)} = \\frac{log(8)}{log(2)} = \\frac{log(9)}{log(3)} = 3$</center>\n\nSo fractal dimension is a really rigorous way of stating the \"dimensionality\" of an object-- something we intuitively knew but probably never knew why.\n\nNow down the rabbit hole: Using this defintion also includes the possibility for a *\"fractional\"* dimension. That is, there is mathematically something in between 1D and 2D and in between 5D and 6D. So what does a dimension of 1.36 actually mean?? Well, consider the following:  a point is considered 0D and a line is considered 1D. However, a line can be thought of as being made of an infinite number of 0D points. What if the number of points was *not* infinite. Then, the line has \"gaps\"-- we call that a fractional dimension. The more gaps in the line, the closer it is to a 0 dimension and, conversely, the less gaps in the line, the closer it is to 1D.\n\nHere's a more concrete example: the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) looks like this:\n\n![sierpinski triangle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Sierpinski_triangle.svg/220px-Sierpinski_triangle.svg.png \"Sierpinksi triangle = Dimension of 1.58\")\n\nSo imagine I double the size of the triangle (double the length of each side). The resulting triangle has 3 self-similar pieces. Or, if I quadrupule the sides, I'll get 9 self-similar Sierpinski's. The triangle is neither 1D nor 2D. Instead, it is actually 1.58D!\n\n<center>$\\huge\\frac{log(3)}{log(2)} = \\frac{log(9)}{log(4)} = 1.58 \\text{ dimensions!}$</center>\n\n(_I warned you to get coffee first. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried._)\n\nNow compare the Sierpinski to a simple triangle. It's three simple lines. If I double its size, I can get 4 copies. So that's back to 2D. Where did the 0.42D go? Well, look at the center of the Sierpinksi triangle. It might not be obvious, but that's a blank space. So the Sierpinski is drawn in a 2D space, but only takes up 1.58D of that space. Similarly, in 3D there is the [Menger Sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) which is 2.72D due to its holes.\n\nFractal dimensions are used to measure complexity in the time series. You probably thought of an EEG as a collection of 2D signals of voltage versus time -- however, that is only true for a simple line (think of our simple 2D triangle). More complex lines have transients (brief spikes) and other fluctuations that disrupt the self-similarity in a time series (think of our 1.58D Sierpinski triangle). These are like might \"holes\" in our dimension. So our 2D EEG might actually be somewhere in between 1D and 2D. \n\nWhy should 1.58D makes us happy? Or, more generally, how can fractal dimensions help our analysis? Well, suppose you want to measure the similarity between two very complex signals. You could do the standard cross-correlation. That will tell you if signal A increases what signal B will do. However, FD speaks to the complexity of the shapes of A and B. What if signal A was 1.34D and signal B was 1.89D. Are they alike? Different? Or, conversely, if signal A and B are both 1.734D, doesn't that gives us a little more information about how similar they really are? You can't rely on fractal dimension alone. Two completely different figures could have the same FD. However, it's unlikely that two similar signals would have different FD. So it is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. One more piece of evidence in our analysis.\n\nFractal dimensions have been used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary biomedical signals such as EEG and EKG. The idea is to look at the time series as if it were a geometric figure. So instead of calculating the mean or standard deviation of the signal, we are now calculating non-linear measures such as, how many times the signal changes direction and what the slope of the signal is at smaller time intervals. Of course, this makes it prone to error when there is noise in the data. The shape can be altered by random fluctuations in the signal. Many FD algorithms try to account for the noise.\n\nThere are about 7 billion methods to determine the \"fractal dimension\" of a time series-- all giving slightly different results. Most methods use the same basic approach-- divide the time series into different windows (and different scales) and measure the amount of similarity between windows. Nevertheless, this all depends on how you choose to measure \"similarity\". Remember, we are still trying to fit known shapes to unknown datasets. We're now using very complex shapes to fit our clouds. However, these complex shapes still have very precise repetitions that everyone can identify. But our real world signals are even more complex-- how much similarity between epochs of the signal indicate a true pattern? What is noise and what is a true part of the signal? So which method best calculates the Fractal Dimension is not a well solved issue. Here are a few ways people have suggested:\n\n+ [Hurst fractal dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurst_exponent)\n+ Petrosian fractal dimension\n+ [Katz fractal dimension](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~littlab/Site/Publications_files/Esteller_2001.pdf)\n+ [Higuchi fractal dimension](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18676171)\n+ [Detrended fluctuation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis) (an extension of Hurst)\n\nAll of these methods seem to be useful in classifying states of EEG (\"waking\", \"imagining movement\") etc. I've provided some references below to peruse.\n\nReferences: \n+ https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~littlab/Site/Publications_files/Esteller_2001.pdf\n+ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00442374/document\n+ http://tux.uis.edu.co/geofractales/articulosinteres/PDF/comparation.pdf - In this paper, they compared Katz, Higuchi, and Petrosian with synthetically generated signals.

It's often used as a measure how how stationary a time series is. Financial analysts use it to determine if there are truly long-term trends in data. (*Is the stock decreasing in value or is this the normal, random fluctuations in stock price?*)\n\nThe exponent is the rate at which the autocorrelation in a time series decreases as the lags increase. If the series $x(t)$ is a self-similar fractal, then $x(bt)$ is statistically equivalent to $b^Hx(t)$, where $H$ is the Hurst exponent. So if we were to take every other datapoint ($b=2$) then the mean of that would be the mean of the original signal multiplied by $2^H$. (Seems analogous to an Eigen?)\n\nHurst first used his exponent to describe how the Nile river's size fluctuated over long periods of time. (He was a hydrologist consulting on the building of a dam.) The width of the Nile changes with time, but Hurst tried to answer: \"Are these changes (a) bouncing around a mean size or (b) steadily increasing (or decreasing)?\" That's a critical point if you want the dam to be useful over decades (and probably centuries) of change.\n\nThe exponent is directly related to the *Fractal Dimension* of the time series and is basically an objective measure of whether the randomness in a time series is \"mild\" or \"wild\". In other words, how random is the randomness? It is usually one of 3 cases: mean reverting, [random walking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), or trending.\n\n> A *random walk* is often compared with the walk of a drunk person. With each step there is a 50-50 chance of the drunk moving foward/left or forward/right. In the short term, the walk looks \"random\", but over the long term the drunk stays along the mean path because of the 50-50 process.\n\nH is a number between 0 and 1. Meanings for H exponents:\n+ $H = 0.5 :$ Geometric random walk (Brownian motion), no correlation\n+ $H < 0.5 :$ Mean-reverting series or antipersistent (it's a random walk with smaller than normal steps. Therefore, an increase in step size is likely followed by a decrease in step size (or vice-versa))\n+ $H > 0.5 :$ Trending Series - The random walk seems to be persistently going in a direction. So a large step size is likely  followed by a large step size."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9017212b-627f-a102-769f-899da65a7aee","collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"def hurstFD(epoch):\n\n    \"\"\"Returns the Hurst Exponent of the time series vector ts\"\"\"\n    # Create the range of lag values\n    lags = range(2, 100)\n\n    # Calculate the array of the variances of the lagged differences\n    tau = [np.sqrt(np.nanstd(np.subtract(epoch[lag:], epoch[:-lag]))) for lag in lags]\n\n    # Use a linear fit to estimate the Hurst Exponent\n    poly = np.polyfit(np.log(lags), np.log(tau), 1)\n\n    # Return the Hurst exponent from the polyfit output\n    return poly[0]*2.0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fc564c54-cd81-3eee-bf38-e0006288fb90"},"source":"### Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)\n> This code is taken directly from the [nolds](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nolds/0.1.1) Python package.\n\n> Here's a good [primer](https://www.physionet.org/tutorials/fmnc/node5.html) on DFA\n\nPerforms a [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis) on the given data.\n\nRecommendations for parameter settings by Hardstone *et al.*:\n* nvals should be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale so that each window scale has the same weight\n* min(nvals) < 4 does not make much sense as fitting a polynomial (even if it is only of order 1) to 3 or less data points is very prone.\n* max(nvals) > len(data) / 10 does not make much sense as we will then have less than 10 windows to calculate the average fluctuation \n* use overlap=True to obtain more windows and therefore better statistics (at an increased computational cost)\n\nExplanation of DFA:\nDetrended fluctuation analysis, much like the Hurst exponent, is used to find long-term statistical dependencies in time series.\n\nThe idea behind DFA originates from the definition of self-affine processes. A process X is said to be self-affine if the standard deviation of the values within a window of length n changes with the window length factor L in a power law:\n\n$\\sigma(X,L \\times n) = L^H \\times \\sigma(X, n)$\n\nwhere $\\sigma(X, k)$ is the standard deviation of the process X calculated over windows of size k. In this equation, H is called the **Hurst parameter**, which behaves indeed very similar to the **Hurst exponent**.\n\nLike the Hurst exponent, H can be obtained from a time series by calculating $\\sigma(X,n)$ for different n and fitting a straight line to the plot of $\\log(\\sigma(X,n))$ versus $\\log(n)$.\n\nTo calculate a single $\\sigma(X,n)$, the time series is split into windows of equal length n, so that the ith window of this size has the form\n\n$W_{(n,i)} = [x_i, x_{(i+1)}, x_{(i+2)}, ... x_{(i+n-1)}]$\n\nThe value $\\sigma(X,n)$ is then obtained by calculating $\\sigma(W_{(n,i)})$ for each i and averaging the obtained values over i.\n\nThe aforementioned definition of self-affinity, however, assumes that the process is  non-stationary (i.e. that the standard deviation changes over time) and it is highly influenced by local and global trends of the time series.\n\nTo overcome these problems, an estimate alpha of H is calculated by using a \"walk\" or \"signal profile\" instead of the raw time series. This walk is obtained by substracting the mean and then taking the cumulative sum of the original time series. The local trends are removed for each window separately by fitting a polynomial $p_{(n,i)}$ to the window $W_{(n,i)}$ and then calculating $W'_{(n,i)} = W_{(n,i)} - p_{(n,i)}$ (element-wise substraction).\n\nWe then calculate std(X,n) as before only using the \"detrended\" window $W'_{(n,i)}$ instead of $W_{(n,i)}$. Instead of H we obtain the parameter $\\alpha$ from the line fitting.\n\n+ $\\alpha < 1/2$ : \"memory\" with negative correlation\n+ $\\alpha \\cong 0.5$ : we have no correlation or \"memory\", white noise\n+ $1/2 < \\alpha < 1$ : \"memory\" with positive correlation\n+ $\\alpha \\cong 1$ : $1/f$ noise, pink noise  \n+ $\\alpha > 1$ : the underlying process is non-stationary and is unbounded\n+ $\\alpha \\cong 3/2$ : Brownian noise\n\nReferences:\n1.

For $k=4$ and ($N=100$), we get four time series to compare:\n\n>  $x_4^1 : \\left \\{ x(1), x(5), x(9),   ..., x(97) \\right \\}$\n\n>  $x_4^2 : \\left \\{ x(2), x(6), x(10), ..., x(98) \\right \\}$\n\n>  $x_4^3 : \\left \\{ x(3), x(7), x(11), ..., x(99) \\right \\}$\n\n>  $x_4^4 : \\left \\{ x(4), x(8), x(12), ..., x(100) \\right \\}$\n\nBased on these ensembles, we subtract successive values and then sum over the ensemble:\n\n<center>$\\large L_m(k) = \\frac{1}{k} \\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^{\\left \\lfloor \\frac{N-m}{k} \\right \\rfloor} \\left | x(m+ik) - x(m+(i-1)k)) \\right | } \\right ) \\left ( {\\frac{N-1}{\\left \\lfloor \\frac{N-m}{k} \\right \\rfloor k}} \\right )$</center>\n\nwhere:\n+ $N$ is the length of the time series $x(t)$\n+ $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{N-m}{k} \\right \\rfloor$ is the floor of the ratio (so `floor((N-m)/k)`)\n\n**QUESTION: Isn't subtracting successive values just the derivative? Then summing will be the integral of the derivative. So the dervative and then integral is the same as just subtracting the mean from the time series?? Or am I missing something? Why not do that instead?**\n\nAfter getting $L_m(k)$ we compute the average $L_m$:\n\n<center>$\\large \\langle L(k) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{m=1}^k L_m(k)$</center>\n\nThe procedure is repeated for all k from 1 to $K_{max}$. \n\nHiguchi showed that this was the time-domain equivalent of the power spectrum ([PSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density)). For self-similar processes, the power spectrum $P(f)$ has an interesting property:\n\n<center>$P(f) \\propto f^{-\\alpha}$</center>\n\nwhere $f$ is the frequency and $\\alpha$ is the fractal dimension (FD). Therefore, if we plot the power spectrum versus the frequency on a log-log axis, there should be a line with slope of $-\\alpha$. If the exponent is 0, then the power spectrum is independent of frequency (white noise). if the exponent is 1, then there is moderate correlation. If the exponent is 2, then there's a strong [(Brownian) correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_correlation).\n\nHiguchi said that in the time domain, if we plot $\\langle L(k) \\rangle$ versus $\\frac{1}{k}$ on a log-log plot, then the slope is also $\\alpha$. So $\\alpha$ is Higuchi's exponent (or FD).\n\n<center>$ \\langle L(k) \\rangle \\propto {(\\frac{1}{k})}^{FD}$</center>\n\nThe [Higuchi exponent](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/475/1/012002/pdf) is considered to be a measure of the *irregularity* of a time series."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2d6fb16b-af85-e0fd-60fe-5eb2791ab7f6"},"outputs":[],"source":"def higuchiFD(epoch, Kmax = 8):\n    '''\n    Ported from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30119-complete-higuchi-fractal-dimension-algorithm/content/hfd.m\n    by Salai Selvam V\n    '''\n    \n    N = len(epoch)\n    \n    Lmk = np.zeros((Kmax,Kmax))\n    \n    #TODO: I think we can use the Katz code to refactor resampling the series\n    for k in range(1, Kmax+1):\n        \n        for m in range(1, k+1):\n               \n            Lmki = 0\n            \n            maxI = floor((N-m)/k)\n            \n            for i in range(1,maxI+1):\n                Lmki = Lmki + np.abs(epoch[m+i*k-1]-epoch[m+(i-1)*k-1])\n             \n            normFactor = (N-1)/(maxI*k)\n            Lmk[m-1,k-1] = normFactor * Lmki\n    \n    Lk = np.zeros((Kmax, 1))\n    \n    #TODO: This is just a mean.

I think this is similar to a [Wavelet](http://www.wavelet.org/tutorial/wbasic.htm) approach whereby you are looking for frequency bands of successive scales (in reality they are \"scales\" of the mother wavelet). So Fourier is approximating the signal using a combination of sine waves whereas Wavelet is approximating the signal using a combination of non-stationary basis functions. With FT you get a 2D plot (frequency versus amplitude). With Wavelets you are going for a 3D plot (time versus scale versus amplitude).\n\n![sine verus wavelet](http://www.wavelet.org/tutorial/gifs/sine.gif \"Sine wave versus Wavelet\")\n\nRemember, the problem with the Fourier Transform is that we lose temporal information when we go to the frequency domain. So it only works well if the signal is stationary. Wavelets (or more generally time-frequency domain methods) can localize to both frequency and time. They give a more robust snapshot of how the signal component frequencies evolve over time. For example, in the figures below, the x axis is time, the y axis is scale (of the wavelet), and the greyscale value is the amplitude.\n\n![wavelet versus dyad](http://www.wavelet.org/tutorial/gifs/dwtcwt.gif \"Discrete versus Continuous Wavelet Transform of Chirp\")\n\nEssentially, dyads are a \"poor man's wavelet analysis\" (compare how coarse the DWT is compared to the CWT in the figure above.) I think typically they are defined as scales of 2 (hence dyad). So the second scale is twice the time length of the first and the third is quadruple the first. This lends nicely to computer analysis (which is base-2 math) and even works well with acoustical analysis (which uses octaves for musical notes-- i.e. base-8).

This means we scale the data so that it goes between 0 and 1. There are several ways to normalize.

Scaling is important because many of our data modeling algorithms use Euclidean distance (i.e. the vector magnitude or `norm`) in their calculations.
