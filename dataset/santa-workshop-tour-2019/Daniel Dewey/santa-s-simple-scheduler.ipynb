Continue to do FCFS in 0-4999 order, but set a different people limit above day 59 to reduce the large accounting cost at the transition. The 6 under-subscribed day-ranges are very clear in the plot(s) and the lower limit (125) is requiring people get put into those days even though they are not a remaining choice. <br>\n(v3) **570,746** FCFS with split people-limit above day 59. <br>\nMade a matrix output to view the cost-per-person depending on the choice and the number of people: often a higher choice with more people is preferred to the lower choice. With this in mind do the scheduling in order of cost-per-person, first filling the low-request gaps and then the rest and finally putting whatever is left where it will go. Yup, kind of a mess ;-)<br>\n(v4) **132,621** Lowest to highest cost-per-person, fill low regions first. <br>\nLet's include the nice stacked plot from https://www.kaggle.com/ghostskipper/visualising-results <br>\nFill the \"transition\" days of the low-demand regions to a higher level than the middle 2 of the 4 days: this reduces the accounting cost; do this for above 55 and below 51 separately. Restrict to only using choices with no more than 78 for the cost-per-person (e.g, up to choice 7 for a family of 7). Finally, if there are some families left over (9 here) give them their 2nd choice.<br>\n(v5) **97,732** Ms Claus' usual algorithm developed over the years ;-) <br>\nTry implementing a Gift Shop Profit (GSP) term which is larger when `family_id`s are clustered, see the back story among posts in the discussion [the optimal solution has been found, right?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/discussion/120211)  The profit term is larger when `family_id`s are closer together, going as $1/(\\Delta id^3+8)$ .<br>\n(v6) **97,143** As in v5, but restricted choices to 4 or less. Gift Shop Profits are 2,468.<br>\nSeparate the big cell of code into its sections, easier to see what's going on? (A lot of retetition,\ncould define a routine to clean it up.)<br>\nTry to increase the GSP by identifying buddy families: ones that share the same day in their low choices AND that are close-together in their `family_id` values. Was hoping to see that assigning buddies to the same day would i) increase the GSP ii) without messing up the costs too much. Hard to increase GSP over what I have without more severely affecting the costs. Did change the calculation of GSP to go as $126/(\\Delta id^3+125)$ to make it more relevant. Enough messing around with this for now ;-)<br>\n(v7) **96,934** Same as v6, with some attempt to assign \"buddy\" family ids to the same day to increase GSP.\n<hr>\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preliminaries and Setup"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Things to use\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some constants\ndata_dir = \"../input/santa-workshop-tour-2019/\"\nfamily_file = \"family_data.csv\"\n\nNDAYS = 100\nNFAMS = 5000\nMAX_PPL = 300\nMIN_PPL = 125\n\n# The family preference cost parameters\nPENALTY_CONST = [0, 50, 50, 100, 200, 200, 300, 300, 400, 500, 500]\nPENALTY_PPL = [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 18, 18, 36, 36, 199+36, 398+36]\n\n# The seed is set once here at beginning of notebook.\nRANDOM_SEED = 127\nnp.random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the family_cost function\ndef family_cost(ichoice, nppl):\n    global PENALTY_CONST, PENALTY_PPL\n    return PENALTY_CONST[ichoice] + nppl*PENALTY_PPL[ichoice]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show the cost-per-person in matrix form\n# Note that higher choice values can give lower per-person cost.\n# Also created a dictionary mapping the choice-nppl tuple to cost_pp.\ncost_pp_dict = {}\nprint(\"    Cost per Person\")\nprint(\"\\n       nppl= 2       3       4       5       6       7       8\\nichoice\")\n# choices are 0 to 10\nfor ichoice in range(11):\n    # numbers of people in a family are 2 to 8:\n    choice_str = str(ichoice).rjust(5)+\":\"\n    for nppl in range(2,9):\n        cost_pp = family_cost(ichoice, nppl)/nppl\n        cost_pp_dict[(ichoice,nppl)] = cost_pp\n        choice_str = choice_str + str(int(cost_pp)).rjust(8)\n    print(choice_str)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Can use the cost_pp_dict to go through the ichoice, nppl combinations,\n# in order from least to greatest cost-per-person, if that's useful.\n# (Didn't use this, put values in by hand below.)\nif False:\n    sorted_cost_pp = sorted(cost_pp_dict.items(), key = \n             lambda kv:(kv[1], kv[0]))\n    for ich_nppl in sorted_cost_pp:\n        ichoice = ich_nppl[0][0]\n        nppl = ich_nppl[0][1]\n        print(ichoice,nppl)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the accounting cost function\ndef accounting_cost(people_count):\n    # people_count[iday] is an array of the number of people each day,\n    # valid for iday=1 to NDAYS (iday=0 not used).\n    day_costs = np.zeros(NDAYS+1)\n    total_cost = 0.0\n    ppl_yester = people_count[NDAYS]\n    for iday in range(NDAYS,0,-1):\n        ppl_today = people_count[iday]\n        ppl_delta = np.abs(ppl_today - ppl_yester)\n        day_cost = (ppl_today - 125)*(ppl_today**(0.5+ppl_delta/50.0))/400.0\n        day_costs[iday] = day_cost\n        total_cost += day_cost\n        ##print(\"Day {}: delta = {}, $ {}\".format(iday, ppl_delta, int(day_cost)))\n        # save for tomorrow\n        ppl_yester = people_count[iday]\n    print(\"Total accounting cost: {:.2f}.
