Solution to a problem solved by genetic algorithms is evolved.\n\nAlgorithm is started with a set of solutions (represented by chromosomes) called population. Solutions from one population are taken and used to form a new population. This is motivated by a hope, that the new population will be better than the old one. Solutions which are selected to form new solutions (offspring) are selected according to their fitness - the more suitable they are the more chances they have to reproduce.\n\n![](https://tutorials.retopall.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GeneticAlgorithm-1-1024x374.png)\n\nOutline of the Basic Genetic Algorithm\n* **[Start]** Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)\n* **[Fitness]** Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population\n    * **[New population]** Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete\n    * **[Selection]** Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)\n    * **[Crossover]** With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents.\n    * **[Mutation]** With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).\n    * [Accepting] Place new offspring in a new population\n* **[Replace]** Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm\n* **[Test]** If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population\n* **[Loop]** Go to step 2"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## DEAP - Distributed Evoluationary Algorithms In Python\n\n![](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/_images/deap_long.png)\n\nDEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.
