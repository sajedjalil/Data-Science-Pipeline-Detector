If you've taken the **[Kaggle Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)** and//or the **[Kaggle Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)** course you'll find this notebook to be a good starting place to bridge what you've learned in our micro-courses and applying that knowledge to get started in a competition.  \n\n**How to use this notebook**  \nFeel free to use this notebook as a walkthrough on how to build a preliminary image classification model using TensorFlow and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). You can copy and edit the notebook by clicking on the corresponding button in the top right, which will make your own personal copy of the notebook in your Kaggle account. From there any edits you make will be unique to your own copy of the notebook!\n\n\n**TPUs with TensorFlow**  \nWe'll be using TensorFlow and Keras to build our computer vision model, and using TPUs to both train our model and make predictions. If you'd like to learn about more about TPUs be sure to check out our **[Learn With Me: Getting Started with Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)](https://youtu.be/1pdwRQ1DQfY)** video.  \n\n**References**  \nThis notebook was built using the following amazing resources created by Kagglers:\n- **Martin Gorner:** [Getting Started With 100 Flowers on TPU](https://www.kaggle.com/mgornergoogle/getting-started-with-100-flowers-on-tpu)\n- **Amy Jang:** [TensorFlow + Transfer Learning: Melanoma](https://www.kaggle.com/amyjang/tensorflow-transfer-learning-melanoma)\n- **Phil Culliton:** [A Simple TF 2.1 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/philculliton/a-simple-tf-2-1-notebook)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"papermill":{"duration":0.035886,"end_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:23.118837","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:23.082951","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n\nTensor Processing Units (TPUs) are hardware accelerators that are specialized for deep learning tasks.
