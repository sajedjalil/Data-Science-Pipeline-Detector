One data format where they are yet to make in-roads is tabular data. For tabular data, the most popular algorithms continue to be tree-based boosting algorithms such as [XGBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), [LighGBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightGBM) and [CatBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catboost), or even simple linear algorithms like [Linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)/[Logistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) Regression.\n\nTabNet<sup>[\\[1\\]](#ref1)</sup> is a remedy to this. It is an attention-based neural network introduced in 2019 by a Google Cloud AI team. It beats XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost on multiple datasets such as [Forest Cover Type](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype) and [Poker Hand](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand). It also tends to be more explainable than these other algorithms.\n\nIn this notebook, we will use TabNet to solve the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) competition. We will use the [TabNet implementation for PyTorch by Dreamquark](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) in order to do this. We will also use [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) to tune the hyperparameters of the model.\n\n\n> Note: For more on TabNet, refer to this video by the co-author of the above mentioned library: [Talks # 4: Sebastien Fischman - Pytorch-TabNet: Beating XGBoost on Tabular Data Using Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysBaZO8YmX8).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install TabNet\n!pip install pytorch-tabnet","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-12T20:37:32.801232Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-12T20:37:32.801726Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-12T20:37:46.192421Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-12T20:37:32.801628Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-12T20:37:46.191378Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TabNet Architecture","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Architecturally, TabNet consists of multiple encoder steps, as shown below:\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fM0jdeUB7pgj_Zg1z7jwmeM7ATZzWMF6)\n\nIntuitively, each step selects a subset of features from all the features available in the training data to use for its predictions. How it differs from most other neural networks is that this selection step occurs for each sample instead of the entire training data. Thus, the predictions for each sample are generated by different subset of features. This leads to better performance.\n\nThere are three main layers that make up a step.\n\n### Feature Transformer\n\n![TabNet Feature Transformer](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TSyJwEYjAN5CT5cdTLLaVbcmmXXaNpL6)\n\nThe feature transformer layer generates an internal representation of the features.\n\nEach layer consists of stacks of a fully-connected layer, a batch normalisation and a [GLU](https://paperswithcode.com/method/glu) activation function, with skip connections in between stacks.\n\nSome of the stacks are shared across all the steps and some stacks are local to a step. That is, the feature transformer in each step uses some weights that are common across every step and some weights that are learnt specifically for that step. This ensures that other steps have some information from every step while generating their internal representation.\n\nTake note of the split block in the overall architecture. This block is used to split the internal representation between the next step (red arrow) and the overall output (blue arrow). Clearly, no such split is required in step $0$ and hence, there is only a red arrow.\n\n### Attentive Transformer\n\n![TabNet Attentive Transformer](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17SAFPueqARehjkxD0UmRmLAXAT8c-DXx)\n\nThe attentive transformer layer takes the learned representation of features as input and outputs a mask which is then used to select the features that should be used for this step and the current sample. The mask can be thought of as consisting of probabilities that sum up to $1$.\n\nEach layer consists of a fully-connected layer, a batch normalisation and a \"sparse\" softmax activation. The softmax activation is sparse since the generated mask has a lot of zeros in it, denoting that the features associated with those zeros are not used for generating predictions.\n\nThe prior scales shown in the diagram consists of information which denotes how much each feature has been used in the previous steps. This is taken into account while generating the mask. Mathematically, if the current step is $i$, $P[i]=\\prod_{j=1}^{i}(\\gamma-M[j])$, where $\\gamma$ is a relaxation parameter and $M[j]$ is the mask in step $j$. When $\\gamma=1$, a feature is enforced to be used only for one step (since then $\\gamma-M[j]\\approx0$) and as $\\gamma$ increases, the constraint relaxes so that the feature can be used for multiple steps.\n\n### Feature Masking\n\nThe feature masking layer uses the generated mask to select a subset of features. It is a element-wise product between the original features and the generated mask.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explainability","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"An important goal behind TabNet is to be explainable.
