Our beliefs describe the world we know, so when we observe something, its conditional probability represents the likelihood of what we’ve seen given what we believe, or:\n\n#### P(observed | belief)\n\n\nFor example, suppose you believe in climate change, and therefore you expect that the area where you live will have more droughts than usual over a 10-year period. Your belief is that climate change is taking place, and our observation is the number of droughts in our area; let’s say there were 5 droughts in the last 10 years. Determining how likely it is that you’d see exactly 5 droughts in the past 10 years if there were climate change during that period may be difficult. One way to do this would be to consult an expert in climate science and ask them the probability of droughts given that their model assumes climate change.\n\nAt this point, all we’ve done is ask, “What is the probability of what I’ve observed, given that I believe climate change is true?” But what you want is some way to quantify how strongly you believe climate change is really happening, given what you have observed. Bayes’ theorem allows you to reverse P(observed | belief), which you asked the climate scientist for, and solve for the likelihood of our beliefs given what you’ve observed, or:\n\n\n#### P(belief | observed)\n\n\nIn this example, Bayes’ theorem allows us to transform our observation of five droughts in a decade into a statement about how strongly you believe in climate change after you have observed these droughts. The only other pieces of information you need are the general probability of 5 droughts in 10 years (which could be estimated with historical data) and our initial certainty of our belief in climate change. And while most people would have a different initial probability for climate change, Bayes’ theorem allows you to quantify exactly how much the data changes any belief.\n\nFor example, if the expert says that 5 droughts in 10 years is very likely if we assume that climate change is happening, most people will change their previous beliefs to favor climate change a little, whether they’re skeptical of climate change or they’re Al Gore.\nHowever, suppose that the expert told you that in fact, 5 droughts in 10 years was very unlikely given our assumption that climate change is happening. In that case, our prior belief in climate change would weaken slightly given the evidence. The key takeaway here is that Bayes’ theorem ultimately allows evidence to change the strength of our beliefs.\n\nBayes’ theorem allows us to take our beliefs about the world, combine them with data, and then transform this combination into an estimate of the strength of our beliefs given the evidence we’ve observed. Very often our beliefs are just our initial certainty in an idea; this is the P(A) in Bayes’ theorem. We often debate topics such as whether gun control will reduce violence, whether increased testing increases student performance, or whether public health care will reduce overall health care costs. But we seldom think about how evidence should change our minds or the minds of those we’re debating. Bayes’ theorem allows us to observe evidence about these beliefs and quantify exactly how much this evidence changes our beliefs.\n\n## Simplest Proof of Bayes Theorem\n\nLet’s consider two probabilistic events A and B. We can correlate the marginal probabilities P(A) and P(B) with the conditional probabilities P(A|B) and P(B|A) using the product rule:\n\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/1fGQOXC.png)\n\nFirst of all, let’s consider the marginal probability P(A): this is normally a value that determines how probable a target event is, like P(Spam) or P(Rain). As there are no other elements, this kind of probability is called Apriori, because it’s often determined by mathematical considerations or simply by a frequency count. For example, imagine we want to implement a very simple spam filter and we’ve collected 100 emails. We know that 30 are spam and 70 are regular. So we can say that P(Spam) = 0.3.\n\nHowever, we’d like to evaluate using some criteria (for simplicity, let’s consider a single one), for example, e-mail text is shorter than 50 characters. Therefore, our query becomes:\n\n---\n\n### The time complexity of Naive Bayes\n\nLet, n = no of data points, d = no of features in an input vector x. and c = number of classes.\n\nSo, if we have ‘d’ features then we calculate ‘d’ likelihoods for 1 class. Then for ‘c’ class **d \\* c** likelihood probabilities\n\n#### T (n) = O (ndc)\n\nAll it needs to do is computing the frequency of every feature value di for each class.\n\nIf d is small we can neglect the presence of d and we can tell O(n).\n\n#### For space complexity, we store only the likelihoods for ‘c’ classes,\n\nS(n) = O(dc)\n\nFor Testing phase : Since all the likelihood probabilities are already calculated in training phase then at\n\nthe time of evaluation we just need to lookup.\n\n#### S(n) = O(dc)\n\n---\n\n### Difference between naive Bayes & multinomial naive Bayes\n\nIn general, to train Naive Bayes for n-dimensional data, and k classes you need to estimate $P(x_i | c_j)$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ . You can assume any probability distribution for any pair $(i,j)$ (although it's better to not assume discrete distribution for $P(x_i|c_{j_1})$ and continuous for $P(x_i | c_{j_2})$). You can have Gaussian distribution on one variable, Poisson on other and some discrete on yet another variable.\n\n#### Multinomial Naive Bayes simply assumes multinomial distribution for all the pairs, which seem to be a reasonable assumption in some cases, i.e. for word counts in documents.\n\n---\n\nThe general term **Naive Bayes** refers the the strong independence assumptions in the model, rather than the particular distribution of each feature. A Naive Bayes model assumes that each of the features it uses are conditionally independent of one another given some class. More formally, if I want to calculate the probability of observing features $f_1$ through $f_n$, given some class c, under the Naive Bayes assumption the following holds:\n\n$$ p(f_1,..., f_n|c) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(f_i|c)$$\n\nThis means that when I want to use a Naive Bayes model to classify a new example, the posterior probability is much simpler to work with:\n\n$$ p(c|f_1,...,f_n) \\propto p(c)p(f_1|c)...p(f_n|c) $$\n\nOf course these assumptions of independence are rarely true, which may explain why some have referred to the model as the \"Idiot Bayes\" model, but in practice Naive Bayes models have performed surprisingly well, even on complex tasks where it is clear that the strong independence assumptions are false.\n\nUp to this point we have said nothing about the distribution of each feature. In other words, we have left $p(f_i|c)$ undefined. The term **Multinomial Naive Bayes** simply lets us know that each $p(f_i|c)$ is a multinomial distribution, rather than some other distribution. This works well for data which can easily be turned into counts, such as word counts in text.\n\nIn summary, Naive Bayes classifier is a general term which refers to conditional independence of each of the features in the model, while Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is a specific instance of a Naive Bayes classifier which uses a multinomial distribution for each of the features.\n\nReferences:\n\nStuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. 2003. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2 ed.).

The order or context of the words is not analyzed here. Similarly, if we have a bag filled with six pencils, eight pens, and four notebooks, the algorithm merely cares about recording the number of each of these objects, not the order in which they are found, or their orientation. You typically want to use the bag-of-words feature extraction technique for document classification. Why is this the case? We assume that documents of certain classifications contain certain\nwords. For example, we expect a document referencing political science to perhaps feature jargon such as dialectical materialism or free market capitalism; whereas a document that is referring to classical music will\nhave terms such as crescendo, diminuendo, and so forth. In these instances of document classification, the location of the word itself is not terribly important. It’s important to know what portion of the vocabulary is present in one class of document vs. another.\n\n","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Start of Google

Examples of stop words in English are “a”, “the”, “is”, “are” and etc. The intuition behind using stop words is that, by removing low information words from text, we can focus on the important words instead.\n\nFor example, in the context of a search system, if your search query is “what is text preprocessing?”, you want the search system to focus on surfacing documents that talk about text preprocessing over documents that talk about what is. This can be done by preventing all words from your stop word list from being analyzed. Stop words are commonly applied in search systems, text classification applications, topic modeling, topic extraction and others.\nIn my experience, stop word removal, while effective in search and topic extraction systems, showed to be non-critical in classification systems. However, it does help reduce the number of features in consideration which helps keep your models decently

I recommend setting the grid search parameter\n\nThe grid search returns a dictionary (accessible through `.cv_results_`) containing the scores for each fold train/test scores as well as the time it took to train/test each fold. Also a summary of that data is included using the mean and the standard deviation. PS. in newer version of pandas you'll need to include return_train_score=True PS.S. when using grid search, splitting the data to train/test is not necessary for model selection, because the grid search splits the data automatically (cv=10 means that the data is split to 10 folds)\n\nMore on the above point - from this very detailed official [doc](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) -\n\nA test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n\nA model is trained using of the folds as training data;\n\nthe resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).\n\nThe performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary validation set), which is a major advantage in problems such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small.\n\n## 6.

Mostly because of skewed distribution. When the variables span several orders of magnitude. Income is a typical example: its distribution is \"power law\", meaning that the vast majority of incomes are small and very few are big. This type of \"fat tailed\" distribution is studied in logarithmic scale because of the mathematical properties of the logarithm:\n\nLogarithm naturally reduces the dynamic range of a variable so the differences are preserved while the scale is not that dramatically skewed. Imagine some people got 100,000,000 loan and some got 10000 and some 0. Any feature scaling will probably put 0 and 10000 so close to each other as the biggest number anyway pushes the boundary. Logarithm solves the issue.\n\nIf you take values 1000,000,000 and 10000 and 0 into account. In many cases, the first one is too big to let others be seen properly by your model. But if you take logarithm you will have 9, 4 and 0 respectively. As you see the dynamic range is reduced while the differences are almost preserved. It comes from any exponential nature in your feature\n\n$$log(x^n)= n log(x)$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$log(10^4) = 4 * log(10)$$\n\nand\n\n$$log(10^3) = 3 * log(10)$$\n\n### A note on the alpha parameter\n\nWe add a small smoothing value, alpha to prevent from the probabilities going to zero\n\nIn Multinomial Naive Bayes, the `alpha` parameter is what is known as a [_hyperparameter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization); i.e. a parameter that controls the form of the model itself. In most cases, the best way to determine optimal values for hyperparameters is through a [grid search](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) over possible parameter values, using [cross validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) to evaluate the performance of the model on your data at each value.

In standard binary regression scenario the models give you probability of observing the \"success\" category. In multinomial case, the models return probabilities of observing each of the outcomes. Log probabilities are simply natural logarithms of the predicted probabilities.\n\nLet's take an example feature \"best\" for the purpose of this illustration, the `log` probability of this feature for class `1` is `-2.14006616` (as you pointed out), now if we were to convert it into actual probability score it will be `np.exp(1)**-2.14006616 = 0.11764`. Let's take one more step back to see how and why the probability of \"best\" in class `1` is `0.11764`. As per the documentation of [Multinomial Naive Bayes][2], we see that these probabilities are computed using the formula below:\n\n![img](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gyokC.png)\n\nWhere, the numerator roughly corresponds to the number of times feature \"best\" appears in the class `1` (which is of our interest in this example) in the training set, and the denominator corresponds to the total count of all features for class `1`. Also, we add a small smoothing value, `alpha` to prevent from the probabilities going to zero and `n` corresponds to the total number of features i.e. size of vocabulary.\n\n## Predicting Probabilities for the actual test dataset of Kaggle","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We already have the variable \"naive_bayes_results_for_bow_with_best_alpha\" fitted as below earlier\n# naive_bayes_results_for_bow_with_best_alpha.fit(X_train_hstacked_all_bow_features_vectorized, y_donor_choose_train)\ny_predicted_for_bow_with_best_alpha_test_df = naive_bayes_results_for_bow_with_best_alpha.predict_proba(test_df_hstacked_all_bow_features_vectorized)[:, 1]\n\nprint('y_predicted_for_bow_with_best_alpha_test_df.shape is ', y_predicted_for_bow_with_best_alpha_test_df.shape)","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T13:15:22.751645Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T13:15:22.752197Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T13:15:22.957156Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T13:15:22.752141Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T13:15:22.95535Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating file for final submission","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sample_sub = pd.read_csv(\"../input/donorschooseorg-application-screening/sample_submission.csv\")\n\n# y_predicted_for_bow_with_best_alpha_test_df","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T13:19:01.010487Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T13:19:01.010988Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T13:19:01.0969Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T13:19:01.01095Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T13:19:01.09575Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission_naive_bayes = pd.concat([sample_sub, pd.Series(y_predicted_for_bow_with_best_alpha_test_df , name='project_is_approved')] , axis=1 ).iloc[:,[0,2]]\nsubmission_naive_bayes.head()\n# submission_naive_bayes.to_csv('submission_naive_bayes.csv', index=False)\n","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T13:19:13.56035Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T13:19:13.561022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T13:19:13.5874Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T13:19:13.560961Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T13:19:13.586368Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
