Penalty/Length ~ 0.91 % <br>\nThe overall penalty is a very small fraction of the length even though the Reindeer are getting very few carrots and will have to go large stretches with no carrots.\n* Reindeer Score: 2140304. ;  Carrots: 17802 ;  Length: 1796336.   Penalty/Length ~ 19.1 % <br>\nHere the Reindeer get all their carrots but there are still long streches without carrots, as significantly indicated by the 19% penalty. Optimizing this score will put emphasis on giving the Reindeer their carrots uniformly thoughout the trip. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e1e137c10790431d11062696cc387013f477a1e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This kernel was forked from the Viel's 'Greedy Reindeer', the beginning of which is left largely intact with deletions (\"##dd) and modifications ( \"#dd\") described in comments.

Penalty/Length ~ 19.1 % <br>\n<br>\n* versions 8-11: `dist_array()` is modified so that points that are more than X_width units to the right of city i have their x,y values (and hence distances) scaled w.r.t. city i by 0.25x, 0.50y to encourage not leaving points far to the right. This is supposed to cause the path to get to the right and then generally wander to the left where the NP is. <br>\n<br>\n   x_width: +++  Rudolph Score: 1811546    Carrots: 2751    Length: 1796014   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: 900  Rudolph Score: 1811543    Carrots: 2751    Length: 1796012   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: 700  Rudolph Score: 1810758    Carrots: 2760    Length: 1795395   Penalty/Length ~ 0.85 % <br>\n   **x_width: 600 Rudolph Score: 1810034    Carrots: 2749    Length: 1794670   Penalty/Length ~ 0.85 %** <br>\n   x_width: 500  Rudolph Score: 1812581    Carrots: 2755    Length: 1797040   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: 400  Rudolph Score: 1810903    Carrots: 2761    Length: 1795567   Penalty/Length ~ 0.85 % <br>\n   x_width: 250  Rudolph Score: 1811318    Carrots: 2749    Length: 1795979   Penalty/Length ~ 0.85 % <br>\n   x_width: 160  Rudolph Score: 1813114    Carrots: 2741    Length: 1797953   Penalty/Length ~ 0.84 % <br>\n   x_width: 100  Rudolph Score: 1811804    Carrots: 2674    Length: 1796233   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: _40  Rudolph Score: 1816430    Carrots: 2688    Length: 1800851   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: _20  Rudolph Score: 1815703    Carrots: 2757    Length: 1800129   Penalty/Length ~ 0.86 % <br>\n   x_width: _16  Rudolph Score: 1817859    Carrots: 2676    Length: 1802083   Penalty/Length ~ 0.87 % <br>\n<br>\n   x_width: +++  Reindeer Score: 2125349   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1796014   Penalty/Length ~ 18.33 % <br>\n   x_width: 900  Reindeer Score: 2125370   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1796012   Penalty/Length ~ 18.33 % <br>\n   x_width: 700  Reindeer Score: 2128203   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1795395   Penalty/Length ~ 18.53 % <br>\n   **x_width: 600 Reindeer Score: 2125915   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1794670   Penalty/Length ~ 18.45 %** <br>\n   x_width: 500  Reindeer Score: 2126214   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1797040   Penalty/Length ~ 18.31 % <br>\n   x_width: 400  Reindeer Score: 2123749   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1795567   Penalty/Length ~ 18.27 % <br>\n   x_width: 250  Reindeer Score: 2123493   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1795979   Penalty/Length ~ 18.23 % <br>\n   X_width: 160  Reindeer Score: 2122414   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1797953   Penalty/Length ~ 18.04 % <br>\n   X_width: 100  Reindeer Score: 2119948   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1796233   Penalty/Length ~ 18.02 % <br>\n   X_width: _40  Reindeer Score: 2141576   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1800851   Penalty/Length ~ 18.92 % <br>\n   X_width: _20  Reindeer Score: 2133879   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1800129   Penalty/Length ~ 18.54 % <br>\n   X_width: _16  Reindeer Score: 2132361   Carrots: 17802   Length: 1802083   Penalty/Length ~ 18.32 % <br>\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dae593a8d0d7855694408d3512d052fa1679e7f5","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
