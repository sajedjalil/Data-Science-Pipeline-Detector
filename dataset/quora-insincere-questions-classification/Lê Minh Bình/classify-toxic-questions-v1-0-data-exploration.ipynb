Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.\n\nQuora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions - those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.\n\nIn this competition, Kagglers will develop models that identify and flag insincere questions.
