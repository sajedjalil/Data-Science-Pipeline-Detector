Assess the complexity of a passage of text\n2. Measure the impact machine learning has on motivating learners\n\nHowever, the rest of the overview makes clear this competition is concerned with the former rather than the latter.\n\n### Step 2: Get the Data\nLucky for us, the organizers have provided us with the data we need to start with so we can move on to the next step. \n\n### Step 3: Explore the Data to Gain Insights\nLet's start by loading some useful libraries as well as the data.
