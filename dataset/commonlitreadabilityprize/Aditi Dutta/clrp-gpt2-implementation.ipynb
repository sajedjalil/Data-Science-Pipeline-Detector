It’s a causal (unidirectional) transformer pretrained using language modeling on a very large corpus of ~40 GB of text data.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\n\n_GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data._\n\n\n## Understanding the architecture\n\nGPT-2 is based on Transformer architecture which was first proposed by the team of researchers at Google in their paper ['Attention is all You Need'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The paper described an encoder-decoder based architecture that used concepts like multi heads and self-attention.\n\nTransformer architecture is an improvement over RNN based architectures like LSTM and GRU due to various reasons:\n- Transformers can achieve parallelization of tokens (which are basically parts of a text) within an input.\n- Transformers require constant O(1) number of operations to learn dependency between two tokens independently of their position distance in a sequence. This makes transformers better at capturing long-term dependencies.\n- With the help of multi-head attention, the model can capture various aspects of the input and improve its expressive ability.\n\nGPT-2 is essentially a decoder-only transformer. The model is built by stacking up the transformer decoder blocks.\n<img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt71da4c740e00faaa/blt1c4150bcaddeae45/601c8d573e70bb4c12c6feea/Vision-Transformer-Model-Architecture-1024x746.jpg\" width=\"600px\">\n\nUnlike the self-attention that transformers use, GPT-2 uses **masked self-attention**. A normal self-attention block allows a position to peak at tokens to its right. Masked self-attention prevents that from happening, which means that they only use the left context to predict the next word.\n\nLet's now try to understand the process step-by-step.\n\n# Step 2: Importing useful libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\nimport re\nimport random\nfrom numba import cuda\nimport gc\ngc.enable()\n\nimport torch.nn as nn                    \nimport torch.nn.functional as F          \nimport torch.optim as optim               \nfrom torch.optim import lr_scheduler\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n\nimport transformers\nimport tokenizers\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\nfrom transformers import (GPT2Config,\n                          GPT2Tokenizer,\n                          GPT2Model,\n                          AdamW, \n                          get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup,\n                          logging)\n\nfrom torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nscaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n\nlogging.set_verbosity_warning()\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter('ignore')\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-21T18:16:32.078772Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-21T18:16:32.079343Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-21T18:16:41.910851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-21T18:16:32.079252Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-21T18:16:41.909764Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Some configurations for the model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Look for gpu to use.

BPE is a middle ground between character and word-level encodings which helps it in managing the vocabulary of large corpora. This behavior also enables the encoding of any rare words in the vocabulary with appropriate subword tokens without introducing any “unknown” tokens.\n\n#### Choice of the GPT2 tokenizer: \nWe could have chosen another pre-trained BBPE tokenizer for this study.

Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the from_pretrained() method to load the model weights._\n\nThen, we import and initialize our GPT2 model, which is a transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.\n\nLoading the three essential parts of the pretrained GPT2 transformer: `configuration`, `tokenizer` and`model`.\n\nWhile creating the model_config(`config`), we will mention the number of labels we need for our regression task, which is only need one label for num_labels.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class TextModel(nn.Module):\n     \n    def __init__(self):\n        super(TextModel, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Get model configuration\n        config = GPT2Config.from_pretrained(\n            '../input/hugging-face-gpt2/gpt2/config.json', \n            n_layer=12, n_head=12, num_labels=1, layer_norm_epsilon = 1e-7, \n            output_hidden_states=True, output_attentions = False)    \n        self.gpt = GPT2Model.from_pretrained(\n            '../input/hugging-face-gpt2/gpt2/pytorch_model.bin', config=config)\n        \n        # resize model embedding to match new tokenizer\n        self.gpt.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer)) #resize the dictionary size of the embedding layer        \n        # fix model padding token id\n        self.gpt.config.pad_token_id = self.gpt.config.eos_token_id\n        for param in self.gpt.parameters():\n            param.requires_grad = True    \n            \n        self.drop = nn.Dropout(config.attn_pdrop)\n         \n        self.attention = nn.Sequential(  \n            nn.LayerNorm(config.hidden_size),\n            nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_layer),            \n            nn.ReLU(),                       \n            nn.Linear(config.n_layer, 1),\n            nn.Softmax(dim=1)\n            )         \n        \n        self.regressor = nn.Sequential(     \n            nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd),\n            nn.Linear(config.n_embd, 1)                        \n            )\n        \n    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, past_key_values=None): \n        # Type: torch tensor\n        outputs = self.gpt(input_ids =input_ids,past_key_values =past_key_values,\n                           attention_mask= attention_mask) \n        \n        # There are a total of 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads and 117M parameters.\n        # We take the hidden states from the last Roberta layer.\n        last_layer_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state\n        \n        # Using the dropout\n        last_layer_hidden_state = self.drop(last_layer_hidden_state)\n        \n        # The number of cells is MAX_LEN.\n        # The size of the hidden state of each cell is 768 (for gpt2).\n        # In order to condense hidden states of all cells to a context vector,\n        # we compute a weighted average of the hidden states of all cells.\n        # We compute the weight of each cell, using the attention neural network.\n        weights = self.attention(last_layer_hidden_state)\n        \n        # weights.shape is BATCH_SIZE x MAX_LEN x 1\n        # last_layer_hidden_states.shape is BATCH_SIZE x MAX_LEN x 768        \n        # Now we compute context_vector as the weighted average.\n        # context_vector.shape is BATCH_SIZE x 768\n        context_vector = torch.sum(weights * last_layer_hidden_state, dim=1) \n        out = self.regressor(context_vector)\n        \n        return out","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-21T18:16:42.383088Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-21T18:16:42.383636Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-21T18:16:42.401358Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-21T18:16:42.383591Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-21T18:16:42.400137Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.2: Training Preparation\nWe now activate the training mode of our model — and finally, initialize our optimizer.\n\n#### Set seed for reproducibility\nA random seed is used to ensure that results of our model are reproducible.
