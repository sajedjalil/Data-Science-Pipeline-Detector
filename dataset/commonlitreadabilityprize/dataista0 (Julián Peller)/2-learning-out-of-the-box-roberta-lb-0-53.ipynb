This is the second kernel of the series `Learning 🤗`, a personal project I'm currently working on. I am an experienced data scientist diving into the hugging face transformers library and this series or kernels is a \"working diary\", as I do it. The approach I'm taking is the following: \n1. Explore various out-of-the-box models, without digging into their technical details. \n2. After that, I'll start going over the best ranked public kernels, understand their ideas, and reproduce them by myself. \n\nYou are invited to follow me in this journey. In this short kernel  we fine-tune an out-of-the-box cased RoBERTa, with just the minimal set up required for it to run in this competition, obtaining a leaderboard score of `0.53`. \n\n\nThis is an ongoing project, so expect more notebooks to be added to the series soon. Actually, we are currently working on the following ones:\n\n\n1. [Learning 🤗  - Out-of-the-box BERT [LB: 0.577]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/1-learning-out-of-the-box-bert-lb-0-577)\n2. [Learning 🤗 - Out-of-the-box RoBERTa [LB: 0.53]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/2-learning-out-of-the-box-roberta-lb-0-53) (this notebook)\n3. [Learning 🤗 - Out-of-the-box Electra [LB: 0.58]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/3-learning-out-of-the-box-electra-lb/) \n4. _Learning 🤗 - Minimal fine tuning (WIP)_\n5. _Learning 🤗 - Preprocessing (WIP)_\n6. _Learning 🤗 - Reviewing public kernels (WIP)_\n7. _Learning 🤗 - Intra-domain pre training RoBERTa (WIP)_\n\n\n\n## This notebook\n\nThe code below is just a copy of the code in [1- Learning 🤗  - Out-of-the-box BERT [LB: 0.577]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/1-learning-out-of-the-box-bert-lb-0-577) with just 2 changes, which are the following ones.
