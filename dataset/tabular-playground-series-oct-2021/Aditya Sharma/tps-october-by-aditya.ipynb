Also I forgot to add v12 to the dataset.\nI'm too lazy to add it now. You know where it is if you really want it.\nBut yes - notice I added a new dataset which should be public. This is a dataset containing the key oof and submission data that this notebook has generated. \nSo it was effectively public already. I've just colleced and centralised it.\n\n\nOnly a couple days left and this notebook is about 20th on the list of public notebooks. An improvment of 0.0003 would put it in 1st place or public notebooks. \nIt would also move it into top 30-100 of the real LB. I wonder how many of those tied for 30th have teh exact same copied code.\n\nThis gives us something to aim for as the vast majority of better scoring code is generally just blending and lets be honest: If your code runs in less that 20 seconds it probably isn't going to be that original.\n\nI'm keen to try some ensemble with a twist.
