But how can se get the entire graph? As mentioned before, the curve is obtained by considering all values in the interval [0, 1] as possible thresholds. Let's first consider the two extreme points:\n\n* By setting `threshold = 0`, all our predictions would be equal to 1 (unless we have predictions probabilities equal to 0, which is rare). If everything is predicted as positives, then there can only be TP and FP (and no TN or FN). Therefore we must alse have `fpr = 1` and `tpr = 1`, which corresponds to the upper right corner of the graph, i.e. the point with coordinates (1, 1).\n* By setting `threshold = 1`, nothing will be predicted as positive, so TP = FP = 0 and consequently `fpr = 0` and `tpr = 0`, which corresponds to the lower left corner of the graph, i.e. the point with coordinates (0, 0).\n\nFor every value of the threshold between 0 and 1, we will obtain a new point of the curve. If we start from 1 and continuously decrease the value of the threshold down to 0, the number of TP and FP will either increase or remain unchanged. Therefore, the **ROC curve goes from (0, 0) to (1, 1) continuously and is monotonically increasing**.\n\nNotice, however, that if we vary the threshold from 1 to 0, the values of `fpr` and `tpr` will only change when the threshold \"crosses\" one of the values in the list of predicted probabilities (`predicted_probs`).
