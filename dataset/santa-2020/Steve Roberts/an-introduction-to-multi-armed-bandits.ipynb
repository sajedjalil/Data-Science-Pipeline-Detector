You need to find which machine gives the biggest payout, so you can make as much money as possible in the allocated time.\n\nEach play of a machine (or pull of the bandit’s arm) corresponds to one time slot and you only get to play for a fixed number of time slots.\n\nIn this competition we're not playing slot machines, trying to win as much money as possible, instead we're using candy machines and trying to win Santa's Elves as many candy canes as possible.

To get the maximum amount of candy we'll need to exploit the knowledge we've gained, so that we don’t waste time trying bad machines that don't return any candy.\n\nThis is an example of the classic exploration-exploitation dilemma, in which you want to explore the possible options in search of the best one while, at the same time, wanting to exploit the information that has already been obtained, so that you can gain the maximum possible overall reward.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Multi-Armed Bandit Strategies\n\nSo, to get the maximum amount of candy for the Elves, we've got to try the machines to find the good ones and, once found, we then need to use those machines.

Obviously, since this approach doesn't search the machines to find which is the best, it has a very good chance of not using the best machine. Epsilon-Greedy tries to fix this by introducing a measure of exploration. By default it will use the machine its so far found to be th best, but at random intervals it will try one of the other machines. The degree of exploration is governed by its Epsilon parameter.\n\nAdditionally, if you start with the assumption that none of the machines are going to return any candy (i.e. all machines initially have an average reward of zero) then, as soon as you find a machine that does return some, it will instantly be better than all the others and will therefore become the default machine. As a result, all the other machines will have to wait for the epsilon-greedy search to reach them. So its going to take a very long time to find the best machine and discount bad machines. \n\nThe optimistic greedy approach tries to fix this problem by, instead of assigning an initial reward of zero to each machine, it assigns a high initial expected reward. The effect of this is to make all machines be tried once during the first round of testing.
