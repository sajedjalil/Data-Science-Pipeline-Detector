{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# More Candy !  -  Santa 2020"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dairy\n\n**(v1)**: 13-Dec-2020 Read through discussion posts, [Lilian Weng's MAB post](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit), etc. The basic situation is not so tricky but the \"Simulations Platform\" is a bit mysterious... Try different code demos related to the RPS... <br>\n14,15-Dec Copy/play-with Xin Cui's [\"Weighted expected mean and std\"](https://www.kaggle.com/xincuimath/weighted-expected-mean-and-std-estimation), (\"BayXC\") vs Beta distribution. Make simple \"max candies\" model/prediction, 1292 combined scores.\nLook through [Simple MAB](https://www.kaggle.com/ilialar/simple-multi-armed-bandit) notebook (nice beta plot - add a plot to BayXC stuff). <br>\nMade a simple \"scan, repeat\" agent written into submission.py. Is that what I need to submit? Yes.<br>\n**(v2)** 15-Dec Well, my scan-repeat starts with 0, 1, 2, etc. *and so do lots of other agents*. So subtract a small random amount from the starting all 1s so that argmax will not see them as equal (and go in order) and instead they will be in a random (fixed) scan order. <br>\nThe skill rating is kind of strange... For reference, submit the random agent from v2. I expect this to rate lower than my other ones:<br>\n**(v3)** Setup global variables to keep track of bandit properties (pulls, rewards and their dfs, predicted mean prob with discount factor included, i.e., the prob we expect to have if it is pulled. Set all bandits to having on reward and one non-reward observation giving a mean of 0.5. Add some noise to those values to reduce sequential selection of bandits. Pull the bandit with the largest dfmean value.<br>\n**(v4)** Noticed that there is a Santa 2020 submission.py that implements ucb_agent(). Compared to that my \"select largest dfmean value\" (v3) agent zooms ahead for the first half-ish of the pulls, then falls behind... THe bandit-pulled vs step number plot shows a clear change in behavior around 700 steps, my problem is in the \"end game\"? Modified my agent to use only observed rewards to calculate dfmean (removed starting rewards of [1,0]), after first pass select bandit with the highest mean+std.<br>\n**(v5)** Re-structure the code slightly adding a \"state\" value to help implement a strategy. Found/fixed some errors in how the reward history was filled in. In the first \"scan\" state continue pulling a bandit if a reward is obtained up to a max of 4 rewards. After that chose the bandit with the highest df-ed mean + std. <br>\n**(v6)** Nice discussion posts in [Some thoughts about the rating system](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2020/discussion/204741) and Aatif Fraz' notebook with [Chances of getting a candy](https://www.kaggle.com/aatiffraz/a-beginner-s-approach-to-performance-analysis) plot - add that below, along with 90th, 50th percentiles.  Clean up the structure to be more clearly state-based. The V6 agent has 3 states: i) bandits are scanned initially in random order and each bandits is pulled until they produce a 0, or 4 rewards in a row; ii) bandits with dfmean > 0.5 are pulled until there are none > 0.5; finally iii) the bandit with maximum dfmean+dfstd is pulled.<br>\n**(v7)** Don't like that opponent might spy on my repeat pulls, so try to arrange things so that each pull is randomly selected from bandits with some criteria.\nGo to a 5-state scheme: i) each pulled once; ii) all-1s are pulled at random until no all-1s; iii) dfmean > 0.5 pulled; iv) [0],[1,0],[0,1],etc pulled alternately w/dfmean; and v) max dfmeans+dfstds pulled.<br>\n**(v8)** Use foms as flag instead of dfmeans in state 1; pull <= 2 zero rewards in state iv (more explore); add a 6-th \"endgame\" state starting at step 1200 (require mean>0.25); poach opponents bandit if played 3 times in a row.<br>\n**(v9)** Checkout MAB in chapter 2 of [Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). Cleaned up the states code a bit: keep all the state's action in one place (no more 'setup for next state').\nPlot histograms of means and dfmeans after each state - showed where exploration was needed. Some changes for version 9: added one repeat and possible poaching in state 1; in state 3, 2/3 time do best dfmean and mix in 1/3-time pull bandits that have only 1 zero reward; state 4 slight adjusts; state 5 dfmean+dfstd but mix in 1/10-time explore bandits with mean < 0.25; endgame state 6: pull highest dfmean but only among ones with mean>0.20.<br>\n**(v10)** Clean up some more, nicer histogram plots, add a 7th state to get hist plot at step 1600.  Added a \"ucb_half5percent\" agent file to do UCB \"correctly\", though the delta value is very large compared with BayXC std, so use 0.5 times delta. <br>\nSome adjustment of the poaching criteria, but otherwise no intentional, significant change to the submitted agent's operation.<br>\n**(v11)** Cleaning up things. Slight changes to scheme: state 2 copy opponent if I was going to do that one anyway; state 4 is 0.30 to 0.50 and <= 7; state 5 < 0.35; and state 7 >0.25. Added plots of estimated and actual thresholds for all the snapshots. <br>\n**(v12)** Little stuff: added 30, 60, 90, 100 %-tile lines to snapshot plots. Added the [\"Vegas Slots\"](https://www.kaggle.com/sirishks/pull-vegas-slot-machines) agent as one to compare with mine. Considering [adding bandit information based on opponent's pulls](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2020/discussion/203391)... added it only in my play states 2 and 3 -- still high probabilities present so OK to assign reward = 1 based on an opponent's repeat pull, might slightly over-estimate some bandit's thresholds. <br>\n**(v13)** Slight changes, mostly in state 5: dfmean+0.5\\*dfstd, mix w/(1/10) dfstd > 0.10 <br>\n**Commit following versions running against the \"vegas slots\" agent.** <br>\n**(v14)** Another tweak to state 5: dfmean+0.5\\*dfstd, w/(1/6) dfstd > 0.06. <br>\n**(v15)** Made a histogram of simulated player's score to show variation due to threshold randomness (at end of nb.) Combined states 1,2 and slight changes to the state 1,2 poaching and the other-reward including. Expect about the same performance. <br>\n**(v16)** Had left out the \"pull other's choice if it's among ones I want to exploit\" logic that was in v14 state 2; added it to the combined states 1,2. States 1,2 prints out what happened at each of its steps; changed the Explore-every-nth value from 2 to 3.\n\n### Submissions\nSubmitted agents, from newest to oldest; ratings as of most recent submission.<br>\n(v16) Submission 1xxxxxxx **???.?** as v15, state 1,2 includes \"other pull\" as was in v14. <br>\n(v15) Submission 1xxxxxxx **???.?** as previous v14, combined states 1 and 2.<br>\n(v14) Submission 18887673 **709.5** 7 state as v13-v11 but state 5: dfmean+0.5\\*dfstd, w/6 dfstd > 0.06 <br>\n(v13) Submission 18876229 **678.1** 7 state as v12,v11 but state 5: dfmean+0.5\\*dfstd, w/10 dfstd > 0.10 <br>\n(v12) Submission 18860127 **700.0** 7 state as v11, with adding opponent assumed rewards.<br>\n(v11) Submission 18846489 **667.9** 7 state: rand pull each (1 repeat); rand pull first 0; dfmean w/1-zero; dfmean+0.5dfstd, w/ 2-zeros or 30-50,7; dfmean+dfstd, w/mean<0.35; dfmean w/mean>0.20, dfmean w/mean>0.25.<br>\n(v10) Submission 18843273 **658.3** 6(7) state: rand pull each (1 repeat); rand pull first 0; dfmean w/1-zero; dfmean+0.5dfstd, w/ 2-zeros or 35-55; dfmean+dfstd, w/mean<0.25; dfmean w/mean>0.20.<br>\n(v10) Submission 18843269 **599.5** UCB half-delta(5%) -
