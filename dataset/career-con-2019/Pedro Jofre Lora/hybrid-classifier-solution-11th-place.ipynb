The hybrid classifier leveraged four steps of classification (denoted by (1), (2), (3), and (4)), performed in series in order to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. (1) First, the position data was exploited to predict the groups from which the data was originally split. These predicted groups generated sample sizes that were orders of magnitude greater than the original samples and predicted nearly 75% of the data. (2) Using TSFRESH, motion signals were then analyzed at the original sample size to generate a dataframe of time and frequency dependent features. These features were themselves classified based on hypothesis tests run in TSFRESH to reduce the total number of features used for standard classification techniques. (3) Six standard classifiers were tuned and trained on the dataframe developed in (3), which yielded a series of unique predictions at the smallest sample level. (4) A meta ensemble classifier was developed that leveraged the unique predictions from (3) alongside the groups that were predicted in (1) to produce a final prediction. This meta ensemble classifier was tuned by weighting the results of the standard classifiers, and a simple evolutionary algorithm was used to optimize the weights for each classifier. The hybrid classifier as a whole achieved 93.3% accuracy on the provided test set, which was significantly better than ensemble classifiers alone (66.5% accuracy) or position based grouping alone (75.9% accuracy). This finding corroborates other findings([1](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17d6/d64202aeeeab07a09c3ff06cbee5f0632ce0.pdf), [2](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2017/1930702/), [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-009-0194-7)) that purpose-built hybrid classifiers outperform base and ensemble classifiers alone."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Table of Contents\n1.

This competition challenged competitors to solve a classification problem in order to help a robot safely navigate its environment by predicting the surface on which the robot was moving using data from the Inertial Measurement Units. 128 samples (likely 0.25 seconds) were available from each of 10 channels (4 position and 6 motion) to make predictions.\n\nMy approach can be broken down into four distinct steps. The first step exploits the position data in order to regroup series in the train and test datasets combined. Then, I extracted time and freqency dependent features from each series and used the hypothesis testing tools in TSFRESH to select for the most relevant features. In the third step, I trained a slew of standard classifiers and evaluated their performance. Finally, I built a meta ensemble classifier that leveraged individual classifiers to produce a more robust prediction.\n\nYou may be wondering why I consider my solution a hybrid classifier. First, let me distinguish between a hybrid and an ensemble classifier. An ensemble classifier lets individual classifiers cast votes on a classification and then chooses the class with the most votes (sometimes in a weighted fashion). Each classifier can (and does) run in parallel, and each casts a vote only at the end. In contrast, a hybrid classifier lets individual classifiers classify subsets of the data. These subset classifications can then be used directly or can be fed into another classifier in order to classify again. For this reason, a hybrid classifier must be run in sequence. \n\nThis analysis must be run in sequence, since the results of the first classification (regrouping) is necessary for the meta ensemble classifier to make predictions. The results of regrouping are *also used directly*, though only to classify a subset of the data. Furthermore, the features that are calculated from the data are themselves classified (selected) by running hypothesis tests using the target information. This solution is a hybrid classifier for all of these reasons.\n\nFinally, though this work is my own, it is certainly the case that reading through comments and looking at publicly available kernels on Kaggle influenced my work! In particular, I wouldn't have known about TSFRESH had I not seen [Anuran Chakraborty's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/chanuran/tsfresh-feature). The notebook from which I submitted my final entry did not use TSFRESH, and instead, I calculated a smaller set of features by hand. This was more work than using TSFRESH, which is a rich package. \nI also acknowledge that many of us had the same intuition that the position data bled across the train and test groups since it appeared that position was an important predictor in early public kernels. At the onset, I wanted to build a solution that attended to the physics of the problem, so I actually tossed out the position data. As many of us found, using the motion data alone was not enough to place in the top 100. Given that I'm actively seeking a position in a data science role, I relaxed my constraints and decided to look for ways to use the position data in a meaningful way. On a flight back from Shenzhen, it dawned on me that the group_ids in the training set meant that data had been split from longer runs, so I started working on an algorithm to restitch the data in order to upsample. When I landed, I found that there had already been some preliminary work done in that realm, but I chose to stick by the solution that I developed in-flight. Later, I realized that creating groups was useful precisely because I could leverage it in a hybridized approach. \n\nI hope that my thoughts come out in the remainder of the notebook.

Upsampling can be done by slicing the data for 128 samples at every interval, since the original slicing was arbitrary to begin with. Stitching the data will also help to understand the holistic motion of the robot.\n\nThe graph below shows how the data can stitched using location cues. Series are stitched together so that the last entry of a series in an orientation is continuous with the first entry of the same orientation in a different series.

This is easily done by comparing the ends of each series with those of every other series in a dataframe, and returning only those other series who are close (in all positions) to the chosen series. The \"closeness\" is a threshold that can be set by the user to select return more or fewer matches. The threshold is compared to the sum of the absolute differences between each position feature on the ends of both series.\n\nHaving a list of possible matches is helpful, but stitching requires that only one or zero matches be allowed. Given that this robot is a real device, we know that its motion will be contiguous and differentiable at all spots. A second function will check the contiguity and differentiability of the signals at the join. These will both be done through thresholds, since the data is discrete.\n\nFinally, a subroutine wraps the positive and negative select functions and iterates through the entire dataframe in order to return correctly ordered lists of series to be stitched together.

We've looked at some features above (RMS, PSD), but there are a wealth of other features that I can pull out that are likely meaningful. The package TSFRESH was developed to automate feature extraction and selection from time series data. Their work is published in [this paper linked here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218304843?via%3Dihub), and the packgage documentation is publicly available [here](https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nI will only be extracting features from the motion data, since its the only data that should have any predictive power. After all, the position of the robot shouldn't predict what surface it's on (it's not the case that robots only walk east on concrete, though that would make for an interesting story). The position data was exploited above since I knew that the training data was split from a series of longer runs (original groups) and suspected that the same was true for the test data. If I have time, I will analyze how well the model performs in the absence of knowledge from stitching the data. It makes sense to keep the data stitched, however, since it is reasonable to assume that the robot walks on the same surface for at least an extended period of time.\n\nIn any case, I'll extract the relevant features below.

This following hybrid classification leverages all of that information to its extreme.
