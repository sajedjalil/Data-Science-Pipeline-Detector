When trees are created with defined n_estimator, we then test on unseen tuple which were not in the boostrap data.\nIt works on Majority voting technique wherein the test_data_samples are made to run on those trees which were not created with those samples and the tree classify the surfaces and out of it the majority vote given to a surface is chosen.\n\n**Advantage of RF:**\n* Bias is minimized as the full decision trees are created which results in good model fit.\n* Aggregate voting for making decisions.\n\n**XGBoost** - Works similar to AdaBosst and converge using stochastic gradient descent which reduces the error depending on the number of trees to be formed. When incorrectly classified the weight of the feature node is increased and correctly clasified weight is decreased.\nThis help is taking into account misclassified features and try to correct the mistake.This trees are called stumps and they are weak learners, so after n_estimators of trees formed, the model get better and better, weights get updated and we get good classification model.\n\n**Advantage:**\n* Prune the tree reducding the complexity of computing the entropy for the further node\n* Invites regularization which kind of help in achieving the accuracy better as it promote weights of less complexity and try to reduce the features of the model.\n\n**Extra Tree:**\n* It's also called as Extremely Randomized Tree, it works similar to RF.\n* Use unique samples  rather than bootstrap replicas in order to grow the diversify trees. \n* It randomly selects the node and split it randomly too and repeat this step until whole tree is created.\n* Total number of features remains the same i.e sqrt(total_features)\n* It keeps on building trees as specified hyper paramter \"n_estimator\"\n* Works on majority voting technique for classification.\n\n**Advantage:**\n* Faster than all other decision trees and can balance the running time without much losing the accuracy.\n* Works well with noise data, though we tried to filter out the noise\n\n**Hyper Parameters explained:**\n* min_samples_split = min number of samples required to make a split\n* min_samples_leaf = min number of samples required to stop the tree from growing.\n* max_depth = max depth of the tree.\n* gamma = regularization constant used for pruning the trees in Xgboost\n* learning rate/ step_size = how fast you wanna converge used in Xgboost\n* min_child_weight = given some weights to the node and then tweak those to improve from weak learners.\n* n_jobs = -1 use all cores of the cpu to compute.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Confusion Matrix : This tells us how our model has performed in terms of classifying the tuples into relevant lables (in our case it's
