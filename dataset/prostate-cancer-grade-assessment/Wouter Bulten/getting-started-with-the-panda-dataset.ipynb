Examples of open source viewers that can open the PANDA dataset are [ASAP](https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP) and [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/). ASAP can also overlay the masks on top of the images using the \"Overlay\" functionality. If you use Qupath, and the images do not load, try changing the file extension to `.vtif`.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class WSIViewer(object):\n    def __init__(self, plot_size = 1000):\n        self._plot_size = plot_size\n        \n    def set_slide(self, slide_path):      \n        self._slide = openslide.open_slide(slide_path)\n        self._base_dims = self._slide.level_dimensions[-1]\n        self._base_ds = self._slide.level_downsamples[-1]\n        img_arr = self._slide.read_region((0,0), len(self._slide.level_dimensions[-1]), (self._base_dims[0], self._base_dims[1]))\n        \n        self._fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{'x': [0, self._base_dims[0]], \n                                           'y': [0, self._base_dims[1]], \n                                           'mode': 'markers',\n                                           'marker': {'opacity': 0}}], # invisible trace to init axes and to support autoresize\n                                    layout={'width': self._plot_size, 'height': self._plot_size, 'yaxis' : dict(scaleanchor = \"x\", scaleratio = 1)})  \n        # Set background image\n        self._fig.layout.images = [go.layout.Image(\n            source = img_arr,  # plotly now performs auto conversion of PIL image to png data URI\n            xref = \"x\",\n            yref = \"y\",\n            x = 0,\n            y = 0,\n            sizex = self._base_dims[0],\n            sizey = self._base_dims[1],\n            sizing = \"stretch\",\n            layer = \"below\")]\n        self._fig.update_layout(plot_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)',xaxis_showgrid=False, yaxis_showgrid=False, xaxis_zeroline=False, yaxis_zeroline=False);        \n        self._fig.layout.on_change(self._update_image, 'xaxis.range', 'yaxis.range', 'width', 'height')          \n\n    def _gen_zoomed_image(self, x_range, y_range):\n        # Below is a workaround which rounds image requests to multiples of 4, once the libpixman fix is in place these can be removed\n        #xstart = x_range[0] * self._base_ds\n        #ystart = (self._base_dims[1] - y_range[1]) * self._base_ds \n        xstart = 4 * round(x_range[0] * self._base_ds / 4)\n        ystart = 4 * round((self._base_dims[1] - y_range[1]) * self._base_ds / 4)\n        xsize0 = (x_range[1] - x_range[0]) * self._base_ds\n        ysize0 = (y_range[1] - y_range[0]) * self._base_ds\n        if (xsize0 > ysize0):\n            req_downs = xsize0 / self._plot_size\n        else:\n            req_downs = ysize0 / self._plot_size\n        req_level = self._slide.get_best_level_for_downsample(req_downs)\n        level_downs = self._slide.level_downsamples[req_level]\n        # Nasty workaround for buggy container\n        level_size_x = int(xsize0 / level_downs)\n        level_size_y = int(ysize0 / level_downs)\n        new_img = self._slide.read_region((int(xstart), int(ystart)), req_level, (level_size_x, level_size_y)).resize((1000,1000)) # Letting PIL do the resize is faster than plotly\n        return new_img\n    \n    def _update_image(self, layout, x_range, y_range, plot_width, plot_height):\n        img = self._fig.layout.images[0]\n        # Update with batch_update so all updates happen simultaneously\n        with self._fig.batch_update():\n            new_img = self._gen_zoomed_image(x_range, y_range)\n            img.x = x_range[0]\n            img.y = y_range[1]\n            img.sizex = x_range[1] - x_range[0]\n            img.sizey = y_range[1] - y_range[0]\n            img.source = new_img\n\n    def show(self):\n        return self._fig","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"viewer = WSIViewer()\nviewer.set_slide(os.path.join(data_dir, '08ab45297bfe652cc0397f4b37719ba1.tiff'))\nviewer.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
