Dive deep into domain knowledge \n\nSo lets start with the domain knowledge and Address the first question\n\n### Q1) What is Prostate Cancer?\nProstate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate ,a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.\n\nProstate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.\n\n\n### Q2) How it is tested and detected?\nProstate screening tests might include:\n\n* Digital rectal exam (DRE): During a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate, which is adjacent to the rectum. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture, shape or size of the gland, you may need further tests.\n* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA, a substance that's naturally produced by your prostate gland. It's normal for a small amount of PSA to be in your bloodstream. However, if a higher than normal level is found, it may indicate prostate infection, inflammation, enlargement or cancer.\n\nIf a DRE or PSA test detects an abnormality, your doctor may recommend further tests to determine whether you have prostate cancer, such as:\n\n* Ultrasound : If other tests raise concerns, your doctor may use transrectal ultrasound to further evaluate your prostate. A small probe, about the size and shape of a cigar, is inserted into your rectum. The probe uses sound waves to create a picture of your prostate gland.\n* Collecting a sample of prostate tissue : If initial test results suggest prostate cancer, your doctor may recommend a procedure to collect a sample of cells from your prostate (prostate biopsy). Prostate biopsy is often done using a thin needle that's inserted into the prostate to collect tissue. The tissue sample is analyzed in a lab to determine whether cancer cells are present.\n\n### Q3) Where does GLEASON score fit-in all of this?\nWhen a biopsy confirms the presence of cancer, the next step is to determine the level of aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer cells. A laboratory pathologist examines a sample of your cancer to determine how much cancer cells differ from the healthy cells. A higher grade indicates a more aggressive cancer that is more likely to spread quickly.\n\nThe most common scale used to evaluate the grade of prostate cancer cells is called a Gleason score. Gleason scoring combines two numbers and can range from 2 (nonaggressive cancer) to 10 (very aggressive cancer), though the lower part of the range isn't used as often.\n\n### Q4)I got it but What is ISUP grade now?\nAccording to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP), the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule:\n\n* Gleason score 6 = ISUP grade 1\u2028\n* Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) = ISUP grade 2\u2028\n* Gleason score 7 (4 + 3) = ISUP grade 3\u2028\n* Gleason score 8 = ISUP grade 4\u2028\n* Gleason score 9-10 = ISUP grade 5\u2028\n\nIf there is no cancer in the sample, we use the label ISUP grade 0 in this competition. \n\n\n### Q5) How has the Gleason scores been generated in the dataset?\nEach WSI in this challenge contains one, or in some cases two, thin tissue sections cut from a single biopsy sample. Prior to scanning, the tissue is stained with haematoxylin & eosin (H&E). This is a standard way of staining the originally transparent tissue to produce some contrast. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. The glands are hollow structures, which can be seen as white “holes” or branched cavities in the WSI. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. The glandular structure characteristic of healthy prostate tissue is progressively lost with increasing grade. The grading system recognizes three categories: 3, 4, and 5. \n\n* [A]Benign prostate glands with folded epithelium :The cytoplasm is pale and the nuclei small and regular. The glands are grouped together.\n* [B]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 3 has no loss of glandular differentiation. Small glands infiltrate between benign glands. The cytoplasm is often dark and the nuclei enlarged with dark chromatin and some prominent nucleoli. Each epithelial unit is separate and has a lumen.\n* [C]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 4 has partial loss of glandular differentiation. There is an attempt to form lumina but the tumor fails to form complete, well-developed glands. This microphotograph shows irregular cribriform cancer, i.e. epithelial sheets with multiple lumina. There are also some poorly formed small glands and some fused glands. All of these are included in Gleason Pattern 4.\n* [D]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 5 has an almost complete loss of glandular differentiation. Dispersed single cancer cells are seen in the stroma. Gleason Pattern 5 may also contain solid sheets or strands of cancer cells. All microphotographs show hematoxylin and eosin stains at 20x lens magnification.\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/PANDA/GleasonPattern_4squares%20copy500.png\" height=\"100px\">\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
