I'll do my best to summarize their excellent blog post in just a paragraph and a graphic I created.\n\n(1) First thing...throw away the target! We don't need it (that's the **U** in FRUFS for unsupervised). (2) Next we iterate through each $j$ of the $m$ features. **We take a single feature $j$ as the target and try to predict it with a model $f$ using the remaining features.** In this model, the target is `X[sampled, j]`, and the features are `X[sampled, ~j]`. The \"~j\" means every feature not $j$. Since we need to iterate over all the (300) features, we sample the rows in **X** as well just to make fitting a little faster. We can use any model we like inside FRUFS; that's a nice point too: this method is **model agnostic**. (3) Then we take that fitted model for feature $j$ of $m$ and record the **feature importance** scores (again, the importance is model agnostic: for linear models we can use just the coefficients, in the case of gradient-boosted trees it could be split gain or split importance; more generally, for *any model*, it can be [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) or [permutation importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html), etc.!). The feature importances for the $m-1$ features tell you how redundant the information content of feature $j$ is. **The key idea in FRUFS is that a feature's skill in life is it's ability to predict other features!** If feature 1 is important to predict features 2, 3, and 4, then what do we need features 2, 3, and 4 for? Drop them. The final step (4) is to iterate through each feature $j$ of $m$ and average the feature importances across all the runs; we drop features that weren't important on average, keeping only $k$ features (this $k$ is a hyperparameter; if a float, it means the percentage to keep). This means we are dropping the most redundant information from the feature set which *should help generalization*. That's FRUFS. I made the following graphic to show what's going on. Our new feature matrix X', has $k$ columns (or in the case of a float value for $k$, has $k$ fraction of the original columns).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w2Vt8lW.png)\n\nLet's go!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport optuna\nimport joblib, gc\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\nfrom tqdm.notebook import trange, tqdm\nfrom FRUFS import FRUFS\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-23T13:37:48.702103Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-23T13:37:48.702374Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-23T13:37:48.709156Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-23T13:37:48.70234Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-23T13:37:48.708295Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Synthetic Data Example\n\nBefore we get into the Ubiquant data, I think it is helpful to see what FRUFS does on a dataset where we know the ground truth data generating process.

The FRUFS blogpost says we should tune the model, so let's do that...\n\n## FRUFS Hyperparameter Search\n\n![](https://optuna.org/assets/img/optuna-logo.png)\n\nWe want to tune $k$ **and** the hyperparameters of the Regressor that FRUFS uses (parameter `model_r`). One way to do this is to do a global hyperparamter tuning with everything at once. However, one FRUFS run takes ~30 minutes on my server and would take 7x that on Kaggle. As such, I am going to tune the hyperparameters in two stages. First I will tune the LightBGM model used inside FRUFS with **Optuna**, a Baysian hyperparameter tuning package. Then using the \"optimal\" regressor, I will sweep over 5 values of $k$.\n\nTo tune the FRUFS regressor, I use Optuna. The `objective(...)` function acts like the algorithm inside FRUFS: I pick a random feature, and fit a model to that feature with the remaining features. For each Optuna trial, I fit and predict individually for each of 60 randomly selected features of the 300 (I sample it down for speed purposes; even with this sampling, the tuning takes over 24 hours on my local machine). The trial returns the average MSE for each of those feature fits.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"all_columns = df_train.columns.tolist()\n\ndef objective(trial):\n\n    n_feats = 60\n    cumu_mse = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n_feats):\n        # pick a random feature per FRUFS algorithm\n        feature = np.random.choice(df_train.columns)\n        X_columns = set(all_columns) - set([feature])\n\n        train_sampled = df_train.sample(frac=0.10)\n\n        train_x, valid_x, train_y, valid_y = train_test_split(\n            train_sampled[X_columns], train_sampled[feature], test_size=0.25\n        )\n\n        dtrain = lgb.Dataset(train_x, label=train_y)\n        dvalid = lgb.Dataset(valid_x, label=valid_y)\n\n        param = {\n            \"device\": \"gpu\",\n            \"force_col_wise\": True,\n            \"learning_rate\": trial.suggest_float(\"learning_rate\", 0.01, 0.1),\n            \"num_iterations\": trial.suggest_int(\"num_iterations\", 100, 300),\n            \"verbosity\": 0,\n            \"lambda_l1\": trial.suggest_float(\"lambda_l1\", 1e-8, 10.0, log=True),\n            \"lambda_l2\": trial.suggest_float(\"lambda_l2\", 1e-8, 10.0, log=True),\n            \"num_leaves\": trial.suggest_int(\"num_leaves\", 16, 256, step=16),\n            \"feature_fraction\": trial.suggest_float(\"feature_fraction\", 0.4, 1.0),\n            \"bagging_fraction\": trial.suggest_float(\"bagging_fraction\", 0.4, 1.0),\n            \"bagging_freq\": trial.suggest_int(\"bagging_freq\", 1, 7),\n            \"min_child_samples\": trial.suggest_int(\"min_child_samples\", 25, 200),\n        }\n\n        gbm = lgb.train(param, dtrain)\n\n        preds = gbm.predict(valid_x)\n        mse = mean_squared_error(valid_y, preds)\n        cumu_mse = cumu_mse + mse\n        \n    return cumu_mse/n_feats","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-22T02:49:50.819482Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-22T02:49:50.819914Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-22T02:49:50.829716Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-22T02:49:50.819878Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-22T02:49:50.829273Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\nRUN_TUNE = False\n\nif IN_KAGGLE_NOTEBOOK or (RUN_TUNE == False):\n    study = joblib.load(MODEL_PATH / \"optuna_study.pkl\")\nelse:\n    study = optuna.create_study(\n        pruner=optuna.pruners.MedianPruner(n_warmup_steps=10),\n        direction=\"minimize\"\n    )\n    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)\n\njoblib.dump(study, \"optuna_study.pkl\")","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-22T02:49:55.573549Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-22T02:49:55.573878Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-22T02:49:55.711346Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-22T02:49:55.573855Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-22T02:49:55.710098Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Optuna Study Inspection","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Number of finished trials: {}\\n\".format(len(study.trials)))\n\nprint(\"Best trial:\")\ntrial = study.best_trial\n\nprint(\"  Value: {}\".format(trial.value))\n\nprint(\"  Params: \")\nfor key, value in trial.params.items():\n    print(\"    {}: {}\".format(key, value))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-22T02:49:59.573965Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-22T02:49:59.574264Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-22T02:49:59.612082Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-22T02:49:59.574213Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-22T02:49:59.61156Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Optuna has some very nice built in visualizations as well.
