This makes these implementations very time consuming when handling big data.\n\n---\n\nTo tackle this challenge, a straightforward idea is to reduce the number of data instances and the number of features. However, this turns out to be highly non-trivial. \n  \n**For example**, \nit is unclear how to perform data sampling for GBDT. While there are some works that sample data according to their weights to speed up the training process of boosting they cannot be directly applied to GBDT since there is no sample weight in GBDT at all. \n\n---\n\nAs a result two novel techniques were developed towards this goal which are GOSS and EFB. Let's gid deeper into both these techniques.\n\n## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS)</span>**\n\n- While there is no native weight for data instance in GBDT, it was noticed that data instances with different gradients play different roles in the computation of information gain. \n- In particular, according to the definition of information gain, those instances with larger gradients (i.e., under-trained instances) will contribute more to the information gain.\n- Therefore, when down sampling the data instances, in order to retain the accuracy of information gain estimation, we should better keep those instances with large gradients (e.g., larger than a pre-defined threshold, or among the top percentiles), and only randomly drop those instances with small gradients.\n- In the paper, it was proven that such a treatment can lead to a more accurate gain estimation than uniformly random sampling, with the same target sampling rate, specially when the value of information gain has a large range.\n  \n## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)</span>**\n\n- Usually in real applications, although there are a large number of features, the feature space is quite sparse, which provides us a possibility of designing a nearly lossless approach to reduce the number of effective features. \n- Specifically, in a sparse feature space, many features are (almost) exclusive, i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously. \n- Examples include the one-hot features (e.g., one-hot word representation in text mining). \n- We can safely bundle such exclusive features. \n- To this end, researchers designed an efficient algorithm by reducing the optimal bundling problem to a graph coloring problem (by taking features as vertices and adding edges for every two features if they are not mutually exclusive), and solving it by a greedy algorithm with a constant approximation ratio.\n\n> This new GBDT algorithm with GOSS and EFB was termed as LightGBM.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='background:maroon; border:0; color:white' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>Code will be added soon!</center></h3>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"--- \n\n## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Let's have a Talk!</span>**\n> ### Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishandutta0098)\n\n---","metadata":{}}]}
