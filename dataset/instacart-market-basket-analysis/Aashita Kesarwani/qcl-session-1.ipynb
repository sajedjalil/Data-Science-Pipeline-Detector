Number also possess certain other characteristics that ordinal categories do not. For example, the difference between the numbers 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between the numbers 2 and 3 but the same cannot be said for ordinal categories. \n$$ 2-1 == 3-2$$\nSo, converting categories to numbers means adding untrue assumptions that may or may not adversely affect our model. \n\nFor this reason, the prefered method is one-hot encoding. In this method, we build a one-hot encoded vector with dimension equal to the number of classes in the categories. This vector consists of all 0's except for a 1 corresponding to the class of the instance. For example, the *Embarked* column will have one-hot encoded vectors of [1,0,0], [0,1,0] and [0,0,1] for the three ports. This means that we will have three columns for the *Embarked* columns - one for each port and the values for these columns would simply be 1 or 0.\n\nOne-hot encoding is accomplished in pandas using [`get_dummies`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) as given below.
