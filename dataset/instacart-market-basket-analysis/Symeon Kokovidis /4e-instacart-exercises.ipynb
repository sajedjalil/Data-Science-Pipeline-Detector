You can complete any question in any order. **The produced results from one question will not be used on another.**\n\nWhen you complete this assignment keep this kernel as private, make a succesful commit and add as collaborator the [ISLAB](https://www.kaggle.com/uomislab) .\n\nNote that you will be assessed based on the final version submitted before the deadline.\n\nTo answer the questions of this assignment you may create as many code blocks as you wish. In addition, you can use .head( ) or any other method to display your results. **You can use comments to describe the rationale of your solution.** You can also use comments when you use new methods (that we haven't used in our notebooks), new arguments or alternative approaches for the same problem.\n\n**In the case where a code block takes more than 3 minutes to execute, hit the stop button on the left bottom corner and check for any mistakes on your code or your solution in general.**\n\n\nFirst load the requested packages and data files for this assignment:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b8a8af6951ff8ba1a3f10701f67e6baf4e6815e8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load packages\nimport pandas as pd               # for data manipulation\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt   # for plotting \nimport seaborn as sns             # an extension of matplotlib for statistical graphics\n\n#load data\norders = pd.read_csv('../input/orders.csv' )\nproducts = pd.read_csv('../input/products.csv')\norder_products_prior = pd.read_csv('../input/order_products__prior.csv')\naisles = pd.read_csv('../input/aisles.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"73d3027f8c72463123ae309d9b17bddb0dc2c30a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Question 0\n## Q0.0 Create a plot which shows how many orders were placed in each hour of the day. \n- use .groupby( ) method"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3795607820d8e52d0b5b5afaf9074a3e9f443cfb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b65d3f4e454a16286cc1a055ffefb44521b44be0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q0.1 What is the percentage allocation of the orders placed from 9 to 5 (09:00-17:00 inclusive) compared to all orders?\n- store the final percentage on a variable with name 'pct'\n- print the result with the appropriate text"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"290e3d9b1e7ba0b5ffa69c7230c605084b074939"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7085b0574524dc784e2f4f6d950eb071a0ac1108"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"_____________"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d61db9c28b40406ed355b4dea37d9177acb784be"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Question 1\n## Q1.0 Create a DataFrame that keeps all the prior orders and the products that have been purchased"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5f450767897fe5a8570238cf12d917a1389f7ea4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ed7620fd8633987d328db67a2064a1724979deff"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q1.1 For each product find its average position in the cart (in the orders of all customers)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1f9adcbbf986a5e9ea88a91026bed314f5c8df82"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a8f640a0757fcd302bcc77e4607fbae9fb7ca8a8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q1.2 For a given customer, find the average position of a product on its orders\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ecc71f52093704a74f7accdf4e87ba605c34769d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d768dcb204ce7abeb4f57a50bfee6fd4ca374db7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q1.3 Select from user with id==35 the product with id==4942.
