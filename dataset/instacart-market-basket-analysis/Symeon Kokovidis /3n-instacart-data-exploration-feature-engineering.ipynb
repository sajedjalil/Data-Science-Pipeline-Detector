Create a new DataFrame, namely **prd**, that contains data from multiple CSV files\n2. Produce supportive variables with aggregated values from the prd DataFrame\n3. Calculate variables that describe products\n\n# Business Insights\nIn this notebook you will explore Instacart data in order to answer the following business questions:\n* Do users frequently reorder a product? i.e. what is the reorder probability of a product? More specific questions incude:\n - What is the number of unique customers of a product?\n - How many customers buy a product only once (one-shot products)? \n - What is the one-shot ratio of a product? (This ratio is related to the reorder probability of a product)\n - What is the mean one-shot ratio of an aisle?\n\n# Python Skills\n* Merge two DataFrame with inner, left, right join\n* Perform a .groupby( ) on data of a DataFrame that meet a condition\n* Create a new column to an already existing DataFrame\n* Convert and index of DataFrame into a column\n* Divide columns element-wise of a data frame\n* Check for NaN (Not a Number) values and modify them\n* Create a histrogram (distribution plot) of a variable\n* Set a column as the index of a DataFrame\n* Filter data frames based on a condition\n* Select rows of a DataFrame, based on a condition\n* Create a new DataFrame, with column(s) of an existing DataFrame\n* Create ratios through supportive variables\n\n# Packages \n* pandas: .merge() , .reset_index( ),  .isnull(), .any(), set_index(), \n* matplotlib.pyplot: .hist()\n* seaborn: .barplot()"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import data into Python\nWe load the required packages:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b44e11c5e19a31e9e8d3bc2d22cf625a39da2f9e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd               # for data manipulation\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt   # for plotting \nimport seaborn as sns             # an extension of matplotlib for statistical graphics","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fc6985fa52a5f856cd1f13d8a4418e48b5a635f7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Moreover, we load the .csv files in DataFrames:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c94cbbaf4a874add49e815066023a2cdc834f4d5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"orders = pd.read_csv('../input/orders.csv' )\nproducts = pd.read_csv('../input/products.csv')\norder_products_prior = pd.read_csv('../input/order_products__prior.csv')\naisles = pd.read_csv('../input/aisles.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a83a200660876aaae61f856d74897bf8a2e4e8a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
