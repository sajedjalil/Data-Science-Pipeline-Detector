In this notebook we use three packages, namely pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.\n\n* Pandas: a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive\n\n* Seaborn: a Python data visualization library. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib (see below).\n\n* Matplotlib: a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms\n\nThe aforementioned Python packages are pre-installed for us, so we just need to load them. We use the command **import ** which loads the packages.

For each user, it provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
