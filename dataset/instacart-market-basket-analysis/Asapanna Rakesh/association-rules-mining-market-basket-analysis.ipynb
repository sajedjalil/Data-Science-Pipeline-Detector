However, I quickly discovered that it's not part of the standard Python machine learning libraries.  Although there are some implementations that exist, I could not find one capable of handling **large datasets**.  \"Large\" in my case was an orders dataset with **32 million records**, containing **3.2 million unique orders** and about **50K unique items** (file size just **over 1 GB**).  So, I decided to write my own implementation, **leveraging the `apriori algorithm`** to generate *simple {A} -> {B} association rules*. \n\nSince I only care about understanding relationships between any given pair of items, using apriori to get to item sets of **size 2 is sufficient**.  I went through various iterations, splitting the data into multiple subsets just so I could get functions like crosstab and combinations to run on my machine with 8 GB of memory.  :)  But even with this approach, I could only process about 1800 items before my kernel would crash...  **And that's when I learned about the wonderful world of Python generators.**\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"aa1d4de4449ca66d8d315d8df6d20fc12c4f82e7","_cell_guid":"7cf99a98-f1f2-4666-a39e-aa923c3a0c07"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Python Generators\n\nIn a nutshell, *a generator is a special type of function that returns an iterable sequence of items*.  However, unlike regular functions which return all the values at once (eg: returning all the elements of a list), a generator <i>yields</i> one value at a time.  To get the next value in the set, we must ask for it - either by explicitly calling the generator's built-in \"next\" method, or implicitly via a for loop.  This is a great property of generators because **it means that we don't have to store all of the values in memory at once**.  We can load and process one value at a time, discard when finished and move on to process the next value.  This feature makes generators **perfect for creating item pairs and counting their frequency of co-occurence**.  Here's a concrete **example** of what we're trying to accomplish:  \n\n1. Get all possible item pairs for a given order \n       eg:  order 1:  apple, egg, milk   -->  item pairs: {apple, egg}, {apple, milk}, {egg, milk}\n            order 2:  egg, milk          -->  item pairs: {egg, milk}\n            \n2.

One common application of these rules is in the domain of **recommender systems**, *where customers who purchased item A are recommended item B.*\n\nHere are 3 key metrics to consider when evaluating association rules:\n\n1. <b>support</b>  \n    This is the percentage of orders that contains the item set. In the example above, there are 5 orders in total \n    and {apple,egg} occurs in 3 of them, so: \n       \n                    support{apple,egg} = 3/5 or 60%\n        \n    <i>The **minimum support threshold** required by apriori can be set based on **knowledge of your domain**</i>.  \n    \n    > DOMAIN KNOWLWDGE: In this grocery dataset for example, since there could be thousands of distinct items and an order can contain \n    only a small fraction of these items, setting the support threshold to 0.01% may be reasonable.<br><br><br>\n    \n2. <b>confidence</b>  \n    Given two items, A and B, confidence measures the percentage of times that item B is purchased, given that \n    item A was purchased. This is expressed as:\n       \n                    confidence{A->B} = support{A,B} / support{A}   \n                    \n    Confidence values range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that B is never purchased when A is purchased, and 1 \n    indicates that B is always purchased whenever A is purchased.  \n    \n    **Note that the confidence measure is directional**.     \n    \n    This means that we can also compute the percentage of times that item A is purchased, given that item B was \n    purchased:\n       \n                    confidence{B->A} = support{A,B} / support{B}    \n                    \n    In our example, the percentage of times that egg is purchased, given that apple was purchased is:  \n       \n                    confidence{apple->egg} = support{apple,egg} / support{apple}\n                                           = (3/5) / (4/5)\n                                           = 0.75 or 75%\n\n    A confidence value of 0.75 implies that out of all orders that contain apple, 75% of them also contain egg.  Now, \n    we look at the confidence measure in the opposite direction (ie: egg->apple): \n       \n                    confidence{egg->apple} = support{apple,egg} / support{egg}\n                                           = (3/5) / (3/5)\n                                           = 1 or 100%  \n                                           \n    Here we see that all of the orders that contain egg also contain apple.  \n    \n    **But, does this mean that there is a relationship between these two items, or are they occurring together in the same orders simply by chance?**  To \n    answer this question, we look at another measure which takes into account the popularity of <i>both</i> items.<br><br><br>  \n    \n3. <b>lift</b>  \n    Given two items, A and B, lift indicates whether there is a **relationship** between A and B, or whether the two items \n    are occuring together in the same orders simply by chance (ie: at random).  \n    \n    Unlike the confidence metric whose \n    value may vary depending on direction (eg: confidence{A->B} may be different from confidence{B->A}), \n    **lift has no direction**. This means that the lift{A,B} is always equal to the lift{B,A}: \n       \n                    lift{A,B} = lift{B,A} = support{A,B} / (support{A} * support{B})   \n    \n    In our example, we compute lift as follows:\n    \n         lift{apple,egg} = lift{egg,apple} = support{apple,egg} / (support{apple} * support{egg})\n                         = (3/5) / (4/5 * 3/5) \n                         = 1.25    \n               \n    One way to understand lift is to think of the denominator as the likelihood that A and B will appear in the same \n    order if there was <i>no</i> relationship between them. \n    \n    In the example above, if apple occurred in 80% of the\n    orders and egg occurred in 60% of the orders, then if there was no relationship between them, we would \n    <i>expect</i> both of them to show up together in the same order 48% of the time (ie: 80% * 60%).  \n    \n    The numerator, \n    on the other hand, represents how often apple and egg <i>actually</i> appear together in the same order.  In \n    this example, that is 60% of the time.  \n    \n    Taking the numerator and dividing it by the denominator, we get to how \n    many more times apple and egg actually appear in the same order, compared to if there was no relationship between     them (ie: that they are occurring together simply at random).  \n    \n    In summary, lift can take on the following values:\n    \n        * lift = 1 implies no relationship between A and B. \n          (ie: A and B occur together only by chance)\n      \n        * lift > 1 implies that there is a positive relationship between A and B.\n          (ie:  A and B occur together more often than random)\n    \n        * lift < 1 implies that there is a negative relationship between A and B.\n          (ie:  A and B occur together less often than random)\n        \n    In our example, apple and egg occur together 1.25 times <i>more</i> than random, so we conclude that there exists \n    a positive relationship between them.\n   \nArmed with knowledge of `apriori` and `association rules mining`, let's dive into the data and code to see what relationships we unravel!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"338d54d8ba644a93dd8d5076d5edf3fa24121006","_cell_guid":"719e883c-03f3-4fb1-90e3-fd99855ff022"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Input Dataset\nInstacart, an online grocer, has graciously made some of their datasets accessible to the public.
