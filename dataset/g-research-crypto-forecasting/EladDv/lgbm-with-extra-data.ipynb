Purged Times Series is explained [here][2]. There are many configuration variables below to allow you to experiment. Use either GPU or TPU. You can control which years are loaded, which neural networks are used, and whether to use feature engineering. You can experiment with different data preprocessing, model architecture, loss, optimizers, and learning rate schedules. The extra datasets contain the full history of the assets at the same format of the competition, so you can input that into your model too.\n\n**NOTE:** this notebook lets you run a different experiment in each fold if you want to run lots of experiments. (Then it is like running multiple holdout validaiton experiments but in that case note that the overall CV score is meaningless because LB will be much different when the multiple experiments are ensembled to predict test). **If you want a proper CV with a reliable overall CV score you need to choose the same configuration for each fold.**\n\nThis notebook follows the ideas presented in my \"Initial Thoughts\" [here][1].

If your goal is to just run lots of experiments, then you can choose to have a different experiment in each fold. Then each fold is like a holdout validation experiment. When you find a configuration you like, you can use that configuration for all folds.\n* SEED - a different seed produces a different triple stratified kfold split.\n* FOLDS - number of folds. Best set to 3, 5, or 15 but can be any number between 2 and 15\n* INC2021 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2021.\n* INC2020 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2020.\n* INC2019 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2019.\n* INC2018 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2018.\n* INC2017 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2017.\n* INCCOMP - This controls whether to include the original data of the competition.\n* INCSUPP - This controls whether to include the supplemented train data that was released with the competition.\n* BATCH_SIZES - is a list of length FOLDS. These are batch sizes for each fold. For maximum speed, it is best to use the largest batch size your GPU or TPU allows.\n* EPOCHS - is a list of length FOLDS. These are maximum epochs. Note that each fold, the best epoch model is saved and used. So if epochs is too large, it won't matter.\n* DEPTH_NETS - is a list of length FOLDS. These are the Network Depths to use each fold.

These are the Network Widths to use each fold. The number refers to the number of units per layer. So a number of `32` refers to 32 per layer, and `643` refers to 64 layers, etc.\n* WGTS - this should be `1/FOLDS` for each fold. This is the weight when ensembling the folds to predict the test set.
