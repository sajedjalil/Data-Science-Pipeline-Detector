Now what?\n\nIt was confirmed that `2021-06-13 00:00:00` is the beginning of the test data of the public LB [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting/discussion/285505#1572680).\n\nPlease note that the very nature of the Target is \"leakable\". There is no fault at all at any level here. In any case, the organizers could have been more clear about the fact that the train csv contained the LB data, but they clarified that already. The target is publicly accesible with almost no effort and therefore there is no possible \"realistic leaderboard\".\n\nOn a final note before continuing, the LB was already meaningless even when the solutions were in the `0.01` range. Any solution using the full `train.csv` overfits. Period. I shared the `0.999` to rip off the band aid and move one.\n\n\nThere are __two problems at hand now__:\n\n## 1)  The public LB data is contained in the `train.csv`. \n\nThat is one of the problems, the one that breaks the LB.\n\nThe corolaries are various: \n* The leaderboard is meaningless, rendering the \"LB validation\" useless. \n* It turns impossible to assess whether a publicly shared model is useful or not.\n\nI think we can address it quite easily and find a common ground for sharing solutions (and actually using the LB score of them as an accurate measure of something). The leaderboard is broken and useless, but we can use the submission scores still to communicate, compare results and share good models.\n\nThe second problem is:\n\n## 2) The distance between the public and the private/final LB.\n\nI will ignore this problem for now, and focus on the first one: how to get some common ground for comparing and assessing LB scores.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# Not sure what I am talking about?

Of course, you will have a validation scheme inside the notebook: anything inside the notebook should be before `2021-06-13`, even the validation.\nOnly the submission iteration will see that time horizon.\n\n\n## If you do this, your public LB score can be labelled as \"Strict\". And it will be comparable to any other fellow kaggler reporting a \"Strict\" score.\n\nFor public shared kernels, we can use the tag `[Strict]` or `[S]` for labelling them. The visible scores of notebooks that always have run with this strict mechanism will be reallistic representations of the performance of the model.\n\n\n## So that is the proposal: __drop all the data  after `2021-06-13` and flag your work as `[Strict]` or `[S]`.__\n\n# I wish I see comparable results soon! \n# Can you beat my current `[S] 0.017`?
