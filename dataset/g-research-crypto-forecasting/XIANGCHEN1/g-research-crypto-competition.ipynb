To facilitate your participation, we have created this tutorial notebook covering some relevant concepts for the crypto forecasting challenge.\n\nThe notebook presents an introduction to crypto forecasting, describing the structure and elements of the dataset, some relevant statistical properties, as well as building a couple of ML baseline models and providing an example code submission.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"DO0FyA3q6rTl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Cryptocurrency Market\n\nFirst, a quick introduction to the crypto world. Cryptocurrencies have become an extremely popular and volatile market, delivering massive returns (as well as losses) to investors. Thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created with a few major ones that many of you will have heard of including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nCryptocurrencies are traded extensively across crypto-exchanges, with an average volume of $41 billion traded daily over the last year, according to CryptoCompare (as of 25th July 2021). \n\nChanges in prices between different cryptocurrencies are highly interconnected. For example, Bitcoin has historically been a major driver of price changes across cryptocurrencies but other coins also impact the market.  \n","metadata":{"id":"x3HpXt5v-ko4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Forecasting returns\n\nA fundamental task in financial modeling is predicting how prices will behave in the near future. Using the time-series of historical prices as training data, we want to predict if prices will go up or down, and by how much, namely the asset *returns*.\n\nIn this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build machine learning models to predict the returns of 14 popular cryptocurrencies, in the time scale of minutes to hours. You will have access to millions of rows of minute-by-minute cryptocurrency trading data, with which you'll design your forecasting models for all 14 assets simultaneously. Your predictions will be evaluated by how much they correlate with real market data collected during the three-month evaluation period after the competition has closed. \n\nCryptocurrency returns prediction remains an open and extremely challenging forecasting task. This is a fascinating problem domain for the ML community given the extreme volatility of the assets, the non-stationary nature of the data, the market and meme manipulation, the correlation between assets and the very fast changing market conditions.
