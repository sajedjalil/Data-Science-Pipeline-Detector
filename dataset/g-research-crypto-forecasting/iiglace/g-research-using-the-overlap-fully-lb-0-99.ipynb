It is just a matter or time, and, actually, the LB, in the current situation, is meaningless.\n\n### Below you can see a 18-line submission that overfits the public LB fully, using the fact that the test period is contained in the train data to get the closest point for each test row.\n\nIt is not _actually_ leaky because the fact that the LB is part of the public data was publicly disclosed by the organizers. In my opinion, though, the statement was not clear enough regarding the fact that the public LB test period was contained in the `train.csv`, but I guess it doesn't matter.\n\nI don't know the public test time range, but here I'm assuming that is starts from the placeholder and goes on.\nThe placeholder `test.csv` starts at `'2021-06-13 00:00:00'`. I tried with the full `train.csv` but it takes a long time and it's probably going to fail the submission.\n\nThe LB doesn't seem to be meaningful at all as long as we don't know which training data points are leaking into the public test set and which data points are not.
