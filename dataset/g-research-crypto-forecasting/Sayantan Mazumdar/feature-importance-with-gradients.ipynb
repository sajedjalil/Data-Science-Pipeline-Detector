Purged Times Series is explained [here][2]. There are many configuration variables below to allow you to experiment. Use either GPU or TPU. You can control which years are loaded, which neural networks are used, and whether to use feature engineering. You can experiment with different data preprocessing, model architecture, loss, optimizers, and learning rate schedules. The extra datasets contain the full history of the assets at the same format of the competition, so you can input that into your model too.\n\n**NOTE:** this notebook lets you run a different experiment in each fold if you want to run lots of experiments. (Then it is like running multiple holdout validaiton experiments but in that case note that the overall CV score is meaningless because LB will be much different when the multiple experiments are ensembled to predict test). **If you want a proper CV with a reliable overall CV score you need to choose the same configuration for each fold.**\n\nThis notebook follows the ideas presented in my \"Initial Thoughts\" [here][1].

So a number of `32` refers to 32 per layer, and `643` refers to 64 layers, etc.\n* WGTS - this should be `1/FOLDS` for each fold. This is the weight when ensembling the folds to predict the test set.
