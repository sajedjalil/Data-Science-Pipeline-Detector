This version includes those samples and also has some improvements for the model and metric computation.\n\nNow there is better CV/LB: 5 fold average CV = 0.86, 5 fold average LB = 0.86\n\n---\n## Description\n\nThis approach is kind of like QA and kind of like NER, so I'm calling it QA/NER hybrid. It is like NER because each token will be classified and it is like QA because I am putting the feature text at the beginning of the text (similar to how the question is put in front of the context). The idea is that the classifier will indicate 1 or 0 if that specific token is important for the feature that is put in the input. The feature text will help guide the model to find the right spans. To the extent of my knowledge this is how multi-span QA is done because the typical extractive QA is mainly good for single span prediction.\n\n\nThis uses the Hugging Face Trainer to do 5-fold validation of various base models. This is just a starting point, so please comment if you notice anything that could be improved! There are lots of possibilities for boosting the score so this should be an interesting competition! Happy Kaggling 🦢 (it's supposed to be a Goose). To see the actual training results, check out the versions mentioned in the updates below or check out the [Weights and Biases Report at the end of this notebook.](#Weights-and-Biases-Report)\n\nNote: I'm using base models but performance will likely improve with model size!\n\nThis notebook is heavily based off of [my notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nbroad/bigbird-ner-training-pt-gpu-feedback-prize), the work of others in the Feedback Prize competition, and some of the [Hugging Face example scripts.](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch) \n\nThe inference notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nbroad/qa-ner-hybrid-infer-nbme)   \nThere is a bit of a discrepancy between CV (0.830) and LB (.809)\n\n\n\n\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 12) ******\n\nI tried 5 different models including `xlnet` and `mpnet` but they failed miserably. Version 14 swaps those two out for `bert` and `roberta`. Results in [Weights and Biases Report at the end of this notebook.](#Weights-and-Biases-Report)\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 14) ******\nI thought it would be interesting to show how flexible this notebook is by training 5 different models on 5 different folds. The model definition doesn't change and it still plugs in nicely to the trainer. The models used are: [`bert-base-cased`, `albert-base-v2`, `google/electra-base-discriminator`, `microsoft/deberta-v3-base`, `roberta-base`]. The fast tokenizer for DeBERTa v2/3 is not in the current version of `transformers` but I attach a dataset and add a cell to allow it to be used here. I increase the max length to 512, but I'm not padding every sample to max length, just to the longest sequence in a batch. I use the `group_by_length` flag in `TrainingArguments` which speeds up training by reducing unnecessary padding. Results in [Weights and Biases Report at the end of this notebook.](#Weights-and-Biases-Report)\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 15/16) ******\nI realized that there are some subtle differences in tokenizers that can make the labeling step break. `roberta` will tokenize `This is a sentence` as `['This', 'Ġis', 'Ġa', 'Ġsentence']` and the offset mappings will start the last three tokens at the letter and not the whitespace. Specifically, the offset mapping for the second token is (5,7) and not (4,7) where 5 is the index of `i`.  `deberta-v3` on the other hand will start the offset on the whitespace. The same sentence is tokenized as `['▁This', '▁is', '▁a', '▁sentence']` and the offset mapping for the second token is (4,7). This makes it slightly more annoying to label and decode. This version fixes that labeling and decoding process. So far I have only noticed this in DeBERTa, but I've changed the tokenize function and the decoding function.\n\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 17) ******\n\nTrying a BioBert/PubmedBert model for 5 folds.\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 18) ******\n\nThanks to @ryotak12's [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nbme-score-clinical-patient-notes/discussion/305599), I realized I made a mistake when making folds. I previously split across case_num and feature_num, but this leaks notes between folds. It has now been changed to StratifiedGroupKFold. These leaks are likely the reason for the large discrepancy between train CV and lb.  \nFurthermore, I now use the annotation corrections by @yasufuminakama [link here](https://www.kaggle.com/yasufuminakama/nbme-deberta-base-baseline-train?scriptVersionId=87264998&cellId=17) and I also include some pseudolabeling that I did using my 5-folds of deberta-v3-base (from Version 16). \nThis run uses 5 different models, same as ver 14 but I swap bert-base for biobert/pubmedbert\n\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 20) ******\n\nSame as 18 but with 5 folds of deberta-v3-base\n\n## ****** Update (ver. 21) ******\n\nSame as 20 but no pseudolabels and this time, it actually uses the label corrections","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Steps to include fast tokenizer for deberta v2 or v3\n\nThis must be done before importing transformers","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The following is necessary if you want to use the fast tokenizer for deberta v2 or v3\nimport shutil\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ntransformers_path = Path(\"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/transformers\")\n\ninput_dir = Path(\"../input/deberta-v2-3-fast-tokenizer\")\n\nconvert_file = input_dir / \"convert_slow_tokenizer.py\"\nconversion_path = transformers_path / convert_file.name\n\nif conversion_path.exists():\n    conversion_path.unlink()\n\nshutil.copy(convert_file, transformers_path)\ndeberta_v2_path = transformers_path / \"models\" / \"deberta_v2\"\n\nfor filename in [\n    \"tokenization_deberta_v2.py\",\n    \"tokenization_deberta_v2_fast.py\",\n    \"deberta__init__.py\",\n]:\n    if str(filename).startswith(\"deberta\"):\n        filepath = deberta_v2_path / str(filename).replace(\"deberta\", \"\")\n    else:\n        filepath = deberta_v2_path / filename\n    if filepath.exists():\n        filepath.unlink()\n\n    shutil.copy(input_dir / filename, filepath)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-23T02:51:08.225942Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-23T02:51:08.226196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-23T02:51:08.239332Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-23T02:51:08.226168Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-23T02:51:08.238628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports, setup, and arguments hidden in next cell","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom typing import Any\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom itertools import chain\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom ast import literal_eval\n\nimport torch\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.offline as pyo\n\npyo.init_notebook_mode()\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Dataset\n\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoConfig,\n    AutoTokenizer,\n    DataCollatorForTokenClassification,\n    HfArgumentParser,\n    Trainer,\n    TrainingArguments,\n    set_seed,\n    logging,\n)\nfrom transformers.file_utils import ModelOutput\n\nlogging.set_verbosity(logging.WARNING)\n%env TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass ModelArguments:\n    \"\"\"\n    Arguments pertaining to which model/config/tokenizer we are going to fine-tune from.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    model_name_or_path: str = field(\n        metadata={\n            \"help\": \"Path to pretrained model or model identifier from huggingface.co/models\"\n        }\n    )\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataTrainingArguments:\n    \"\"\"\n    Arguments pertaining to what data we are going to input our model for training and eval.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    k_folds: int = field(\n        default=5, metadata={\"help\": \"How many folds for kfold validation\"}\n    )\n    num_proc: Optional[int] = field(\n        default=None,\n        metadata={\"help\": \"The number of processes to use for the preprocessing.\"},\n    )\n    max_seq_length: int = field(\n        default=None,\n        metadata={\n            \"help\": \"The maximum total input sequence length after tokenization.
