Whoop whoop! But here's where it gets trickier. You don't need to understand all of the following so don't be too disheartened if it seems overwhelming.\n</p>\n\n<h3>The confusion</h3>\n\n<p>\n    I think the confusion here comes from how the function is called making it difficult to analyse as a standalone function. Later, when we call the function, we call it on each possible move for our player. This means that we don't really start at the top of the tree but rather at the second branch. Looking forward in the <i>score_move()</i> function, you'll see <i>minimax()</i> is called with the parameter <i>maximisingPlayer=False</i> which shows us that the first branch of the tree actually involves minimising the score of the opposing player.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you are willing to change this to simiplify your code, note that the <i>valid_moves</i> expression is the same in both our <i>minimax()</i> and <i>agent_minimax()</i>. \n</p>\n\n<h3>Three at once</h3>\n\n<p>\n    Because these functions are so interdependent, we unfortunately have to tackle them together. First, <i>agent_minimax()</i> finds all valid moves and calls <i>minimax()</i> on each possible option. Now, <i>maximisingPlayer=False</i> so within our <i>minimax()</i> function, we consider all possible opponent moves. The function is recursive and calls itself but with <i>maximisingPlayer=True</i> so that we now consider the player's move. This process repeats until we have done it <i>N_STEPS=3</i> times. At this point, we find <i>minimax()</i> is called with <i>depth=0</i> so our function returns the heuristic score for the current setup including all the hypothetical moves that our tree has assumed.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At this point, we can return to the explanation in the course. We calculate the value of each branch of our tree by maximising the score (if it is our turn) or minimising the score (if it is our opponent's turn). Finally, when we have summed the value of all the branches, we should have an optimal choice. The function <i>agent_minimax()</i> has a dictionary called <i>scores</i> which stores all the possible moves (by their column) with the heuristic score of the tree of that move. We then pick the best scoring move (or randomly pick out of the top scoring ones if there is a tie).\n</p>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer, mark, config):\n    is_terminal = is_terminal_node(node, config) # This asks is the game finished\n    valid_moves = [c for c in range(config.columns) if node[0][c] == 0] # This asks if there are any columns that aren't completely filled\n    \n    # If we're at the end of our tree (the leaf) or if the game is finished, return just the heuristic score\n    if depth == 0 or is_terminal:\n        return get_heuristic(node, mark, config)\n    \n    # Maximise the score on our turn\n    if maximizingPlayer:\n        value = -np.Inf\n        for col in valid_moves:\n            child = drop_piece(node, col, mark, config) # Returns new grid if valid move played\n            value = max(value, minimax(child, depth-1, False, mark, config))\n        return value\n    \n    # Minimise the score on our opponent's turn\n    else:\n        value = np.Inf\n        for col in valid_moves:\n            child = drop_piece(node, col, mark%2+1, config)\n            value = min(value, minimax(child, depth-1, True, mark, config)) # Aww jeez, recursion alert\n        return value","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uses minimax to calculate value of dropping piece in selected column\ndef score_move(grid, col, mark, config, nsteps):\n    next_grid = drop_piece(grid, col, mark, config)\n    score = minimax(next_grid, nsteps-1, False, mark, config)\n    return score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def agent_minimax(obs, config):\n    # How deep to make the game tree: higher values take longer to run!\n    N_STEPS = 3\n    \n    # Get list of valid moves\n    valid_moves = [c for c in range(config.columns) if obs.board[c] == 0]\n    \n    # Convert the board to a 2D grid\n    grid = np.asarray(obs.board).reshape(config.rows, config.columns)\n    \n    # Use the heuristic to assign a score to each possible board in the next step\n    scores = dict(zip(valid_moves, [score_move(grid, col, obs.mark, config, N_STEPS) for col in valid_moves]))\n    \n    # Get a list of columns (moves) that maximize the heuristic\n    max_cols = [key for key in scores.keys() if scores[key] == max(scores.values())]\n    \n    # Select at random from the maximizing columns\n    return random.choice(max_cols)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>Test the Agent</h2>\n\n<h3>Determine the winning percentages</h3>\n<p>\nA contrast to prior functions, the course explains <i>get_win_percentages()</i> well and there is no need to edit it to improve your agent.
