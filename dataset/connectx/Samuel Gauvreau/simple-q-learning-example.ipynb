I have read alot of articles and tutorials about the subject and it seems to me that they go quickly to deep q-learning without explaining really what q-learning is. In my experience, the articles I read will talk about the cartpole environnement without code and then jump straight up to deep learning with keras-rl.\n\nWhen trying to implement simple q-learning myself, I was pretty lost. In a real example, what really is a Q-table?\n\nIn this notebook, I will try my best to make q-learning tangible.\n\nDisclaimer 1 : Part of this code comes from an example of Siraj Raval from some time ago.\n\nDisclaimer 2 : I am no expert in Python nor reinforcement learning so if you see ways to improve myself, do not hesitate to comment my notebook!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install kaggle-environments"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 1.

Every square can either have 0, 1 or 2 in it. 0 for nothing, 1 for a token of player 1 and 3 for a token of player 2. So the number of rows is the number of possible combinations : 3**(3*4) = 531441.\n\nIf you really wanted to optimize this, you would see that the board is the same when you flip it, so it reduces by half the possibilities for an even number of columns. Also, most combinations do not exists. You can't have 1,0,1 for column.
