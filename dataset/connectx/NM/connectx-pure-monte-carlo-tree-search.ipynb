For an exaustive review of the topic, check [this](http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/MCTSSurvey.pdf) publication. The main idea behind PMCTS is to explore each possible state $\\textbf{s'}=(s'_1, ... ,s'_m)$, one for each possible actions $\\textbf{a}=(a_1, ... ,a_m)$, from an initial state $s_0$. Then, for each new state $s'_i$, we simulate the game $n$ times, until a terminal state (loss, win, draw) is reached. The *score* of the state $s'_i$ is a function of the number of terminal states reached after the $n$ simulations (e.g., the average number of winnings). The *score* should approximate the real *value* of the state $s'_i$, that is, the likelihood that the position can lead to a win. After simulating each new state, we pick the action $a$, corrisponding to the state with the highest score.\n\nFor this implementation, the set of the possible action is $\\textbf{a}=(0, ... ,6)$, corrisponding to each of the columns we can drop the token from.\nBoth the *score* and the *value* are $1$ for a victory, $-1$ for a loss and $0$ for a draw."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The main parameter of the $\\verb|agent|$ function is the number of simulations to run, while the main variable is the $\\verb|graph|$.
