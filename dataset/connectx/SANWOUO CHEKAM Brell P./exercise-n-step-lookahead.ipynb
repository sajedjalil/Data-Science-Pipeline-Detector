Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_agent(obs, config):\n    #importations\n    \n    import numpy as np\n    import random\n    \n    def get_heuristic(grid, mark, config):\n        num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n        num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n        num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n        num_fours_opp = count_windows(grid, 4, mark%2+1, config)\n        score = num_threes - 1e2*num_threes_opp - 1e4*num_fours_opp + 1e6*num_fours\n    return score\n\n        #
