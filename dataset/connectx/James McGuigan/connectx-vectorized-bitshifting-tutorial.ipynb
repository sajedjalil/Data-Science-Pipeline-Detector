The advantage is that this allows us to operate on this datastructure using bitshifting operations which implemented in the CPU as one-cycle instructions (which is as fast as adding two numbers together). \n\nThe catch is that we need to learn the language of bitshifting and think differently about the types of operations we can efficently do on this datatype.\n\nNOTE: bitshifting in python still comes with the overhead of the python runtime, so is still much slower than a compiled C implemention, however it much faster than asking python to loop over an array of 42 integers.

The compile time is in the order of 50 milliseconds for this small function\n  - This is equlivant to 40,000 function calls on first execution\n  - Kaggle does permit an additional 8 seconds on runtime on your first move to account for data loading and compile times\n- There is a static overhead of casting datatypes between C and Python\n    - Numpy arrays are already casted into C, so there is little overhead in passing a numpy array to a numba function  \n    - Numba works better for larger functions with nested loops\n    - The overhead of passing Tuple[int,int] into these numba functions almost completely offsets the performance advantage of Numba   \n- Bitshifting in C is much faster, thus the additional cost of logical AND has been reduced from 0.6µs to 0.005µs (120x performance increase)\n- I am still trying to figure out the technical constraints of using numba practically within the kaggle submission environment","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"njit_has_no_more_moves   = njit(has_no_more_moves)\nnjit_has_no_empty_spaces = njit(has_no_empty_spaces)\n\ntuple_bitboard = tuple(bitboard)\nprint( f'has_no_more_moves(bitboard):         {timeit.timeit(lambda: has_no_more_moves(bitboard),         number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'has_no_more_moves(tuple_bitboard):   {timeit.timeit(lambda: has_no_more_moves(tuple_bitboard),   number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'is_draw_kaggle(listboard):           {timeit.timeit(lambda: is_draw_kaggle(listboard),           number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'has_no_empty_spaces(bitboard):       {timeit.timeit(lambda: has_no_empty_spaces(bitboard),       number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'has_no_empty_spaces(tuple_bitboard): {timeit.timeit(lambda: has_no_empty_spaces(tuple_bitboard), number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'-----')\nprint( f'njit_has_no_more_moves(tuple_bitboard):    {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_more_moves(tuple_bitboard),   number=1)*1000000:.0f} µs -> {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_more_moves(tuple_bitboard),   number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'njit_has_no_empty_spaces(tuple_bitboard):  {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_empty_spaces(tuple_bitboard), number=1)*1000000:.0f} µs -> {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_empty_spaces(tuple_bitboard), number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'njit_has_no_more_moves(bitboard):          {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_more_moves(bitboard),         number=1)*1000000:.0f} µs -> {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_more_moves(bitboard),   number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\nprint( f'njit_has_no_empty_spaces(bitboard):        {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_empty_spaces(bitboard),       number=1)*1000000:.0f} µs -> {timeit.timeit(lambda: njit_has_no_empty_spaces(bitboard), number=1000000):.4f} µs' )\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# get_gameovers()\n\nThis is a more complicated function which will hopefully show the power of bitboards.\n\nIn the kaggle `is_win()` function, a nested loop is used to iterate, coordinate by coordinate, in all directions from each token in the last played column.\n\nIn the bitshifting version, we precompute `gameovers = get_gameovers()` to avoid repeating this calculation for every bitboard.
