Count number 'useful' pieces in rows/columns/diagonals. Useful means u can place additional pieces to win. \n2. Center Column is the best column. As you can connect to both sides of the board.\n3. Even/odd strategy to ensure that you win in the late game.\n4. Lower rows/columns/diagonals are better than higher up the board.\n5. Columns are worth less than rows and diagonals. This is because columns are the easiest to block.\n\n# Value of a board\nThis is the value_of_my_board- factor*value_of_opp_board. This is done using heuristics above.\nNote factor needs to be more than 1 as it's the opponents turn after u place your piece.\n\n# Algorithm\n Minmax search with Alpha Beta Pruning. Not really hard just go wikipedia see pseudocode. But basically the algorithm goes n-steps ahead pick the best board assuming your opponent plays optimally. Alpha Beta pruning so that you can remove branches early and not search them.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile sub.py\nimport copy\n\ndef value_fn(board,player):\n    if player == 1:\n        opp_player = 2\n    elif player ==2:\n        opp_player =1\n    return _value_fn(board,player)-5*_value_fn(board,opp_player)\n    \ndef _value_fn(board,player):\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Value of center column\n    score+= 101*[board[i][3] for i in range(6)].count(player)\n    \n    # Count score for each row\n    for r in range(6):\n        row_array = board[r]\n        for c in range(4):\n#             window = row_array[c:c+4]\n            window = [row_array[i+c] for i in range(4)]\n            score += evaluate_row(window, player,r)\n    \n    # Count score for each column\n    for c in range(7):\n        col_array = [board[i][c] for i in range(6)]\n        for r in range(3):\n#             window = col_array[r:r+4]\n            window = [col_array[i+r] for i in range(4)]\n            score += evaluate_column(window, player)\n    \n    # Count score on each diagonal\n    # Forward Diagonal\n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(4):\n            window = [board[r+i][c+i] for i in range(4)]\n            score += evaluate_diagonal(window, player,r)\n    \n    # Backward Diagonal\n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(4):\n            window = [board[r+3-i][c+i] for i in range(4)]\n            score += evaluate_diagonal(window, player,r)\n            \n    return score\n\n# @nb.njit(cache=False,parallel=False)\ndef evaluate_diagonal(window,player,r):\n    score = 0\n    # Lower diagonal is better\n    # Doesnt check if empty place == 0 for given row but will do for now\n    inverse_row = 7-r\n    score += inverse_row #ranges from 1-7\n    if window.count(player) == 4:\n        score += 10000\n    elif window.count(player) == 3 and window.count(0)==1:\n        score += 100\n    elif window.count(player) == 2 and window.count(0)==2:\n        score += 10\n    return score\n\n# @nb.njit(cache=False,parallel=False)\ndef evaluate_row(window,player,r):\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Lower row is better\n    inverse_row = 7-r\n    score += inverse_row #ranges from 1-7\n    \n    # Weighs higher on forming rows on odd number rows for player 1\n    # and even rows for player 2 \n    # See connect4 even odd strategy\n    if player == 1 and r%2==0:\n        score +=10\n    if player == 2 and r%2!=0:\n        score +=10\n    \n    if window.count(player) == 4:\n        score += 10000\n    elif window.count(player) == 3 and window.count(0)==1:\n        score += 100\n    elif window.count(player) == 2 and window.count(0)==2:\n        score += 10\n    return score\n\n# @nb.njit(cache=False,parallel=False)\ndef evaluate_column(window,player):\n    score = 0\n    if window.count(player) == 4:\n        score += 10000\n    elif window.count(player) == 3 and window.count(0)==1:\n        score += 100\n    elif window.count(player) == 2 and window.count(0)==2:\n        score += 10\n    return 0.5*score\n\ndef get_valid_actions(board):\n    \"\"\"\n    get possible valid actions\n    \"\"\"\n    return [c for c in range(0,7) if board[0][c]==0]\n\ndef drop_piece(board,col,mark):\n    \"\"\"\n    drop piece at next position\n    \"\"\"\n    board = copy.deepcopy(board)\n    for row in range(6-1, -1, -1):\n        if board[row][col] == 0:\n            break\n    board[row][col] = mark\n    return board\n\ndef check_winner(board):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns player that wins\n    -1 if draws\n    0 if game has not ended\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check rows for winner\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if (board[row][col] == board[row][col + 1] == board[row][col + 2] ==\\\n                board[row][col + 3]) and (board[row][col] != 0):\n                return board[row][col]  #Return Number that match row\n\n    # Check columns for winner\n    for col in range(7):\n        for row in range(3):\n            if (board[row][col] == board[row + 1][col] == board[row + 2][col] ==\\\n                board[row + 3][col]) and (board[row][col] != 0):\n                return board[row][col]  #Return Number that match column\n\n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) for winner\n\n    for row in range(3):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if (board[row][col] == board[row + 1][col + 1] == board[row + 2][col + 2] ==\\\n                board[row + 3][col + 3]) and (board[row][col] != 0):\n                return board[row][col] #Return Number that match diagonal\n\n\n    # Check diagonal (bottom-left to top-right) for winner\n\n    for row in range(5, 2, -1):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if (board[row][col] == board[row -
