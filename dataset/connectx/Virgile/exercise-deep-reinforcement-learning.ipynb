How many nodes should you put in the output layer?\n\n- Option A: 2 nodes (number of game players)\n- Option B: 16 nodes (number of game pieces that each player starts with)\n- Option C: 4672 nodes (number of possible moves)\n- Option D: 64 nodes (number of squares on the game board)\n\nUse your answer to set the value of the `best_option` variable below.

Consider now training an agent to win at the game [Minesweeper](https://bit.ly/2T5xEY8).  The goal of the game is to clear the board without detonating any bombs.\n\nTo play this game in Google Search, click on the **[Play]** button at [this link](https://www.google.com/search?q=minesweeper).  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WzoEfKY.png\" width=50%><br/>\n</center>\n\nWith each move, one of the following is true:\n- The agent selected an invalid move (in other words, it tried to uncover a square that was uncovered as part of a previous move).  Let's assume this ends the game, and the agent loses.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine.  The agent wins the game, because all squares without mines are revealed.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine, but has not yet won or lost the game.\n- The agent detonates a mine and loses the game.\n\nHow might you specify the reward for each of these four cases, so that by maximizing the cumulative reward, the agent will try to win the game?\n\nAfter you have decided on your answer, run the code cell below to get credit for completing this question."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3) (Optional) Amend the code\n\nIn this next part of the exercise, you will amend the code from the tutorial to experiment with creating your own agents!  There are a lot of hyperparameters involved with specifying a reinforcement learning agent, and you'll have a chance to amend them, to see how performance is affected.\n\nFirst, we'll need to make sure that your Kaggle Notebook is set up to run the code.  Begin by looking at the \"Settings\" menu to the right of your notebook.  Your menu will look like one of the following:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kR1az0y.png\" width=100%><br/>\n</center>\n\nIf your \"Internet\" setting appears as a \"Requires phone verification\" link, click on this link.  This will bring you to a new window; then, follow the instructions to verify your account.  After following this step, your \"Internet\" setting will appear \"Off\", as in the example to the right.\n\nOnce your \"Internet\" setting appears as \"Off\", click to turn it on.  You'll see a pop-up window that you'll need to \"Accept\" in order to complete the process and have the setting switched to \"On\".  Once the Internet is turned \"On\", you're ready to proceed!\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gOVh6Aa.png\" width=100%><br/>\n</center>\n\nBegin by running the code cell below.

This will let you see how performance can be affected by changing the algorithm from Proximal Policy Optimization [PPO] to one of:\n  - Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C),\n  - or Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER),\n  - Actor Critic using Kronecker-factored Trust Region (ACKTR), or \n  - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).\n- modify the `change_reward()` method in the `ConnectFourGym` class to change the rewards that the agent receives in different conditions.  You may also need to modify `self.reward_range` in the `__init__` method (this tuple should always correspond to the minimum and maximum reward that the agent can receive).\n- change `agent2` to a different agent when creating the ConnectFour environment with `env = ConnectFourGym(agent2=\"random\")`.  For instance, you might like to use the `\"negamax\"` agent, or a different, custom agent.
