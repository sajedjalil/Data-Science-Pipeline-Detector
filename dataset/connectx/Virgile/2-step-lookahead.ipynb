By definition, \"leaf nodes\" in a game tree are nodes that don't have nodes below them.\n\nIn the ConnectX competition, the game trees will be much larger!  \n\nTo see this, consider a minimax agent that is trying to plan its first move, where all columns in the game board are  empty.

In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.  Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_agent(obs, config):\n\n    import random\n    import numpy as np\n\n    #
