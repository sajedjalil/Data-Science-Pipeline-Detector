{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"My best agent uses adaptive playouts, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and an opening table. (As of this writing, it scores 1465 and is in third place.) Rather than publish that and risk ruining people's fun, I'm sharing an agent with just the most interesting part, the adaptive playouts. (It scores 1240 which would be about 20th place.) Hopefully, that's more useful anyway.\n\nMonte Carlo with adaptive playouts, is sort of like MCTS, except it doesn't build a tree or table, and it treats every move in the playout as if it were an internal node. What follows is a rough description, some discussion, and finally the code for a working agent.\n\nLet's start by considering a plain vanilla Monte Carlo agent. On the agent's turn, it plays as many random games (called 'playouts') from the root as time permits. After every playout, it calculates a reward for the agent (based on win, lose, or tie), and assigns that to the first position played during that playout. Finally, it finds the position with the highest average reward and returns that position as the agent's move.\n\nWe can make a stronger agent by having it make stronger moves in the playouts. We'll start by limiting the random moves to “sensible” moves. If the player can win in one move, that's the only sensible move for that board state. If a move would permit the other player to immediately win, that isn't a “sensible” move, assuming there are any other moves available. Testing for sensible moves requires considerably more computation than simply testing for legality. That means the agent will complete fewer playouts in the allotted time. But the agent still plays better because the playouts are better matched to the domain. The agent is stronger per playout, but more importantly, it is also stronger per second of thinking time.\n\nNow we introduce the all moves as first (AMAF) heuristic. At the end of a playout, the first position played receives the reward, but every other position played by that color receives the reward as well. And we calculate the average reward for the positions played by the other color too. For those familiar with MCTS, AMAF is essentially the same as RAVE. Since we aren't building a tree, it is RAVE from the root: a separate RAVE variable for each color.\n\nThe playouts become adaptive when we use the AMAF values to pick moves during the playouts. Much as with MCTS, we'll incorporate an UCT-like term to encourage exploration in early playouts, but steer later playouts to pick moves with higher AMAF scores.\n\nThe final element is to calculate a prior score for each position in the playouts. (This agent uses heuristics, but a policy net would work too.) So, for every move in a playout, the agent calculates prior scores for every sensible move for that board state. With this addition, the moves in early playouts are biased toward exploration but also toward positions with higher prior scores. As with MCTS, the move returned is the position that was most visited at the root.\n\nLike most Monte Carlo agents, this one plays a relatively weak early game. (Another way to say that is that it needs more time to find good moves in the early game. But this contest enforces a uniform time limit for every move.) The most efficient way to make this agent stronger is to add an opening table and bypass the early game entirely. It's also stronger when combined with an actual MCTS algorithm, but that's a smaller gain and requires more effort."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"agent_as_a_string = \"\"\"\nimport time\nimport numpy as np\nfrom random import choice\nfrom math import sqrt\nfrom numba import njit\nfrom numba import prange\n\n# The following several functions are run with the Numba JIT compiler\n# resulting in a dramatic speed increase.\n\n@njit() # Numba function\ndef win_for_tup_jit(b, tup, I, color):\n    # b[] holds the board state.\n    # tup[] holds 4 board positions that are in a row.\n    # I is one of those positions.\n    # Would placing a color piece on I, result in 4 in a row?\n    for x in tup:\n        if (not ((b[x] == color) or (b[x] == 0))):\n            return False\n        if (not ((b[x] == color) or (x == I))):\n            return False\n    return True  \n\n@njit()\ndef winning_move_jit(b, tupCounts, spaceTups, x_in, color_in):\n    # Would placing a color_in piece on I, result in 4 in a row?\n    # b[] holds the board state.\n    # tupCounts[] and spaceTups[,,] are lookup tables to help examine\n    # different groups of 4 positions in a row.\n    tup = np.zeros(4, np.int32)\n    x = int(x_in)\n    color = int(color_in)\n    for n in range(tupCounts[x]):# for each tup\n        for z in range(4):\n            tup[z] = spaceTups [x, n, z]\n        if (win_for_tup_jit(b, tup, x, color)):\n            return(True)\n    return False   \n\n@njit()\ndef lowest_empty_row_jit(b, j):\n    # Return the row for a stone placed in column j.\n    # (My coordinates are upside down wrt the contest. )\n    r = 6\n    c = 7\n    for i in range(r): # rows\n        x = (i * c) + j\n        if (b[x] == 0):\n            return i\n        # Paronoid check to avoid race conditions if Numba makes this parallel.\n        #if ((b[x] == 0) and (i == 0)):\n        #    return i\n        #if ((b[x] == 0) and (i > 0) and (b[x - c] != 0)):\n        #    return i\n    return(r)\n\n@njit()\ndef get_sensible_moves_jit(b, tupCounts, spaceTups, color, otherColor):\n    # Return a list of moves worth considering, plus the status of the board.\n    # Is there a winning or forced move?
