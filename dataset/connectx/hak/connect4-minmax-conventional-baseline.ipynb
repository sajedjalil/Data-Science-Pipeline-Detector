Since we cannot pass easily data between moves, this feature is mainly used for the positions created in the seatch tree.\nThe connect4 board is a list of 42 integers, a line is list of 4 integers (e.g. 35,36,37,38 = the line on the bottom left), and we encode that line to 35363738.\n\nlines_by_index: key is the position (e.g. 36), values are encoded lines that contain the position 36.
