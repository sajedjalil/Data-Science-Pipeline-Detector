We were asked to examine the effects of playing on synthetic turf versus natural turf along with other factors that might influence player movements and safety. This report represents my analysis. \n\nBased on the data provided, it is my opinion that playing on synthetic turf over two or more seasons is associated with a higher rate of injury to knees, ankles, and feet. I did not find that a history of playing on synthetic fields was the most important indicator of player injury. The following factors showed more importance in the final model used for this analysis:\n\n  - The amount of rest between games\n  - Lateral changes in speed from cutting or turning\n  - Changes in speed from starting and stopping\n  - Environmental factors of precipitation, temperature and stadium type\n\nI find only a weak connection to the playing surface as measured at the time of injury. In other words, the plays ending in player injury on synthetic turf did not appear different from plays without injuries. Rather it was a player's exposure to the factors over time that correlated with increased risk.\n\nAn interesting finding is that the proportion of games played on synthetic turf varied quite a bit among the 250 players in the sample. It also varies across all 32 NFL teams.

PLAYER SURVIVABILITY</div>\n\nI first looked at player injuries using Survival Analysis. Survival analysis was developed to model the expected time until an event happens for members of a given population. In this case I applied it to estimate how long players might go without injury, and to see if playing on synthetic turf affects the probability of injury. This study presented several challenges to using an approach that is statistically valid: \n\n  - Many players started or stopped playing at various times during the study period. \n  - There is no record of injuries before or after the study period.\n  - Risk is not proportional over time \n\nI used the [Kaplan-Meier estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator) to overcome these challenges. Kaplan-Meier is often used in medical research and was used by a team from Cleveland Clinic in 2018 to model the [effects of concussion on player longevity](https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/concussion-in-the-nfl-new-study-demonstrates-significant-detrimental-effects-in-the-short-term/). It is considered to be a reliable indicator when the sample data accurately represent the population.\n\nIn looking at survival rates, I defined \"non-survival\" as missing more than 7 days to injury. That is consistent with the [2018 Mack study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30452873) on the effects of synthetic turf that used injuries with over 8 days missed as a classifier.\n\nI divided the sample of 250 players into two groups: those who played over 50% of all plays on synthetic turf, and those who played less than 50%. The mean percent for all players is 43% so the groups are of roughly equal size. \n\nThe chart below shows the survival rates. For each group you can see the proportion of players who drop out as the number of plays increases form left to right. When one curve is below the other it represents a lower survival rate; i.e., a higher injury rate.

CHARACTERIZING MOVEMENT</div>\n\nKaplan-Meier estimators work very well for assessing factors one at a time. They are not able to discover interactions among factors. Machine learning models, on the other hand, are very good at it. Before building the actual model I looked at player movement data and captured it in a way that is useful for machine learning.\n\nThe Next Generation Stats (NGS) system captures player position and orientation 10 times per second. The data provided for this challenge consisted of 76 million snapshots covering 267,000  plays. I used these base measurements to calculate speed, direction of travel, and acceleration. My objective was to transform these metrics into a useful form that relate to injury-causing forces. \n\nThe video below shows wide receiver Jarvis Landry practicing a route from when he was with the Miami Dolphins. Landry accelerates straight ahead and then cuts to the left.\n\n<span class=\"note\"> <i>Play the video to see Landry's skills.</i> </span>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Video\n\ndisplay(Video(\"https://i.imgur.com/H2nvXRc.mp4\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I used information from the field of kinesiology - the study of human movement - to derive relevant measurements.

The diagram below shows the forces acting on Landry's body, particularly on the leg in contact with the ground, as he makes the cut.\n\n\n<picture of landry with vectors>\n<img src=\"https://nonwebstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/lowerbody/landry_grid2b.png\" alt=\"landry\" height=\"420\" width=\"720\" />\n\n\n\nThe two components of acceleration have these characteristics at every point along a player's path. \n  - Longitudinal acceleration is proportional to changes in player speed. A player speeding up or slowing down experiences acceleration in the direction of travel.\n  - Lateral acceleration is proportional to changes in speed and in a player's direction. A player turning and running in another direction experiences lateral acceleration. Both speed and change in direction contribute to lateral acceleration.\n\n\n\nThe top chart below shows the movement pattern of a single player on one play as seen from above.

MACHINE LEARNING</div>\n\nOne challenge in building a model for machine learning with the dataset is identifying the temporal aspect of the injury when it occurs. As someone who tore his ACL and endured numerous ankle sprains playing sports, I understand the potential for both sudden injuries and injuries that come from stress accumulated over time. \n\nTo account for both types of injuries, I used these steps:\n  - Aggregate the movement metrics over the course of a play, recording maximum and cumulative values.\n  - Merge the play-level data to other play characteristics and injuries including turf type, weather, days missed, etc.\n  - Aggregate play-level data by player, again using averages, maximums, and percentiles of play conditions \n  \nUsing these steps is a common technique to encapsulate lower-level data into a higher level. Given the nature of player injuries, and the goal of improving safety on a per-player basis, a model focused on player history was most appropriate.\n\nIt was important to avoid factors that introduce leakage to the model, meaning anything that hints at whether or not a player was injured. For instance, including the number of plays as a factor allows the algorithm to learn that players only playing a few plays in total were probably injured. Likewise, I chose not to use play type or player position. The data reflects what is already known - certain combinations of plays and positions are more likely to result in injury.\n\nThe table below shows the factors provided as inputs to the machine learning algorithm. As with the survivability analysis and the [Mack study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30452873) mentioned earlier, I defined the target variable by injuries with over 7 days missed."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tracks = pd.read_parquet('../input/nfl-1standfuture-dataprep/PlayerTrackData.parq')\n\n################################\n## Aggregate NGS data by play \n#\n\nkey_cols = ['PlayerKey', 'GameID', 'PlayKey']\naggdict = {'time': ['min', 'max'],\n           'dis':['sum'],\n           'VelocityIn':['max'],\n           'AccelLateral': ['sum', 'max'],\n           'AccelLong': ['sum', 'max']\n           }\ntracks_agg = tracks.groupby(key_cols).agg(aggdict)\n\n\ntracks_agg.columns = [c[0]+'_'+c[1] for c in tracks_agg.columns]\ntracks_agg['PlayDuration'] = tracks_agg.time_max - tracks_agg.time_min\ntracks_agg = tracks_agg.fillna(0).reset_index() #should not be any na's now\n\n\n##########################################\n## Merge NGS data with other play factors \n#\n\nplaylist = playlist.drop_duplicates(key_cols)\ntracks_agg = tracks_agg.merge(playlist, how='inner', on=key_cols)\n\n# null out season breaks and long injuries contained in DaysRest\ntracks_agg.loc[tracks_agg.DaysRest > 11, 'DaysRest'] = np.nan #prevents leakage\n\n# get targets\ntracks_agg['PlayerOut7Days'] = tracks_agg.groupby('PlayerKey')['Missed7Days']\\\n                                        .transform(max)\ntracks_agg['PlayerOut1Day'] = tracks_agg.groupby('PlayerKey')['Missed1Day']\\\n                                        .transform(max)\n\n\n################################\n## Aggregate play-level data by player \n#\n\naggdict_words = {'RosterPosition': ['last'],\n                'FieldType': ['last'],\n                'PlayType': ['last'],\n                }\n\naggdict_nums = {'PctWetWeather': ['mean'],\n                'PctOpenStadium': ['mean'],\n                'Temperature': ['mean'],\n                'DaysRest': ['mean'],\n                'AccelLateral_max': ['mean'],\n                'AccelLong_max': ['mean'],\n                'PctPlaysSynthetic': ['last'],\n                'PlayerOut7Days': ['last']\n                }\n\ndf_words = tracks_agg.groupby('PlayerKey').agg(aggdict_words)\\\n                     .reset_index(drop=True)\ndf_nums = tracks_agg.groupby('PlayerKey').agg(aggdict_nums)\\\n                    .reset_index(drop=True)\n\nplays_agg = pd.concat([df_words, df_nums], axis=1)\nplays_agg.columns = [c[0]+'_'+c[1] for c in plays_agg.columns]\n\n\n#%%\ndisplay(plays_agg.drop(columns='RosterPosition_last').head())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that orientation - the direction a player was facing - was not used in this study. There is an issue with inconsistencies between years where the sensor data was 90 degreees out from the correct value. The issue is documented by Michael Lopez, Director of Football Data & Analytics in [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/112303).\n\nBefore identifying which of the above factors are most relevant to lower-body injuries, it is important to make the most accurate model possible. I used a high-performing machine learning algorithm known as [Extreme Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost) as the basis for a classifier model. As with other machine learning algorithms of this type, it works by playing the Hot and Cold game with itself. The program first searches for patterns to learn what injured players look like as reflected in the data. Then it applies the pattern to data it has not seen and guesses which of these players are injured. After recording where it was correct, it searches for patterns again and makes a new prediction. If the new prediction is better, the model \"gets hotter\" and continues down that path. If the new prediction is \"colder\", the algorithm changes course and uses the factors a different way to find better patterns.\n\nThe intial model scored 0.65 AUC using the factors above as inputs. [AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic), which stands for Area under the Curve, is a common way to measure performance for classifiers. Here the score measures the model's ability to correctly separate players injured for more than seven days from those who were not. A score of 0.5 can be had by choosing players at random and lining them up by the likelihood they were injured. A score of 1.0 is perfect meaning that the groups are correctly ranked and separated."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#%%################################\n## Initial model\n## Xgboost \n#\n\nfrom category_encoders import OrdinalEncoder, WOEEncoder, TargetEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport shap\nshap.initjs()\n\noe = OrdinalEncoder()\n\ny_initial = plays_agg.pop('PlayerOut7Days_last')\nX_initial = oe.fit_transform(plays_agg)\nprint(X_initial.columns)\nxgbdata = xgb.DMatrix(data=X_initial,label=y_initial.to_numpy())\n\nparams = {'objective': 'binary:logistic',\n          'eval_metric': 'auc',\n          'eta': 0.03,\n          'max_depth': 4\n          }\ncv_scores = xgb.cv(dtrain=xgbdata,\n                    params=params,\n                    nfold=5,\n                    num_boost_round=1800,\n                    early_stopping_rounds=60,\n                    verbose_eval=False,\n                    as_pandas=True,\n                    seed=135\n                    )\n\nbest_round = cv_scores['test-auc-mean'].idxmax()\nbest_score = cv_scores['test-auc-mean'].max()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Model Score: {best_score:.2f} AUC after {best_round} iterations.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I improved the model using the following techniques:\n\n  - Combined features into pairs to explicitly include interactions\n  - Randomly shuffled features and selected only those contributing to model perfomance\n  - Tuned the parameters of the model to fit the data\n  \nThe results below show the AUC of the improved model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#####################\n## Optimized Model\n#\n\ny = y_initial\n\n# Keep best factors\nfinal_cols = ['AccelLateral_max_mean', \n              'DaysRest_mean',\n              'PctWetWeather_mean',\n              'AccelLong_max_mean',\n              'PctPlaysSynthetic_last',\n              'Temperature_mean',\n              'PctOpenStadium_mean',\n              'FieldType_last'\n              ]\nX = plays_agg[final_cols].copy()\n\n# Combine\n# X['DaysRest_*Stadium'] = X.DaysRest_mean * X.PctOpenStadium_mean\n\n\n# # Categorize PctPlaysSynthetic into buckets and encode\n# bin_labels = ['b'+str(num) for num in range(10)]\n# X['RelativePctSynth'] = pd.qcut(X.PctPlaysSynthetic_last, 10, labels=bin_labels)\n\nte = TargetEncoder(cols='FieldType_last')\nX = te.fit_transform(X, y=y)\n\n# X = X.drop(columns=['AccelLong_max_mean', 'PctPlaysSynthetic_last'])\n\nparams_final = {'objective': 'binary:logistic',\n                  'eval_metric': 'auc',\n                  'colsample_bytree': 0.7,\n                  'subsample': 0.4,\n                  'gamma': 0.1,\n                  'eta': 0.05,\n                  'max_depth': 10,\n                  'max_leaves': 1024,\n                  'grow_policy': 'depthwise',\n                  'min_child_weight': 1,\n                  'lambda': 1.0,\n                  'alpha': 0.0,\n                  'scale_pos_weight': 1.0,\n                  'tree_method': 'hist',\n                  'max_bin': 256,\n                  'seed': 429\n                  }\n\nskf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=14, random_state=2233)\noof_preds = np.zeros((len(plays_agg)))\nfor train_idx, val_idx in skf.split(X, y):\n    X_train, X_val = X.loc[train_idx], X.loc[val_idx]\n    y_train, y_val = y.to_numpy()[train_idx], y.to_numpy()[val_idx]\n    dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(data=X_train, label=y_train)\n    dval = xgb.DMatrix(data=X_val, label=y_val)\n    watchlist = [(dtrain, 'train'), (dval, 'eval')]\n    model_final = xgb.train(params_final,\n                            dtrain,\n                            num_boost_round=1200,\n                            evals=watchlist,\n                            early_stopping_rounds=60,\n                            verbose_eval=False\n                            )\n    preds = model_final.predict(dval, ntree_limit=model_final.best_ntree_limit)\n    oof_preds[val_idx] = preds                       \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"score = roc_auc_score(y, oof_preds)\nprint(f'Optimized Model Score: {score:.2f} AUC.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This score lies half-way between random choice and perfection.

Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist and consultant who has worked with Major League Baseball and college sports teams on injury prevention, had the following to say in a [recent article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20999403/amazon-nfl-injuries-concussions-big-data-machine-learning):\n\n> “You could look at what happens when a wide receiver moving this quickly makes this sharp turn, and might be able to tease something out. ... One thing they could do is put the information out there and tell coaches that when they ask a lineman to do some kind of block, or route, it creates the sorts of changes in direction or deceleration when we see bad things happen. It’s in the best interest of coaches, after all, to keep players healthy, and there could be alternatives to riskier plays.\n\nI speculate that coaches and players already consider situational risk to the extent possible and make suitable choices. The opportunity going forward is to present additional information to further reduce risk.\n\n<hr>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that playing on synthetic turf over two or more seasons is associated with a higher rate of injury to knees, ankles, and feet. Other factors also show evidence of influencing the likelihood of player injury over time: \n\n  - Lateral changes in speed from cutting or turning\n  - Changes in speed from starting and stopping\n  - Rain or snow during a game\n  - Days of rest between games\n  - Games played in open vs. closed stadiums\n  \nThere may be solid opportunities to address some of these factors for the coming season. Pursuing viable options would improve player health and safety and continue the NFL's commitment to keep the game safe and relevant."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='ax'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">Appendix</div>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"h3\">QUALIFICATIONS</div>\n\nI work as a Customer Data Scientist for [H2O.ai](https://www.h2o.ai/), helping everyday companies use AI to make better decisions.

I did not estimate acceleration in the up-down direction, which is proportional to a player's mass and the number of steps taken.\n  - Body mechanics and angles are not considered. Players with correct running technique and strong mechanics transfer lateral force on the joints to compression force.\n  - Instantaneous changes in direction and speed are smoothed by using a rolling mean over 3/10 of a second (three successive measurements).\n  - As mentioned previously, angular acceleration from twisting is not considered due to problems with orientation data.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python [conda env:nfl] *","language":"python","name":"conda-env-nfl-py"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
