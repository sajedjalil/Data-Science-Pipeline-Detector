From the 22 players on the field to specific characteristics that ebb and flow throughout the game, it can be challenging to quantify the value of specific plays and actions within a play. Fundamentally, the goal of football is for the offense to run (rush) or throw (pass) the ball to gain yards, moving towards, then across, the opposing team’s side of the field in order to score. And the goal of the defense is to prevent the offensive team from scoring.\n\nIn the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams’ offensive yardage comes from run plays. Ball carriers are generally assigned the most credit for these plays, but their teammates (by way of blocking), coach (by way of play call), and the opposing defense also play a critical role. Traditional metrics such as ‘yards per carry’ or ‘total rushing yards’ can be flawed; in this competition, the NFL aims to provide better context into what contributes to a successful run play.\n\nAs an “armchair quarterback” watching the game, you may think you can predict the result of a play when a ball carrier takes the handoff - but what does the data say? In this competition, you will develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. You'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data. And the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current season’s game data as it plays out.\n\nDeeper insight into rushing plays will help teams, media, and fans better understand the skill of players and the strategies of coaches. It will also assist the NFL and its teams evaluate the ball carrier, his teammates, his coach, and the opposing defense, in order to make adjustments as necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the winning model will be provided to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats group to potentially share with teams. You could help the NFL Network generate models to use during games, or for pre-game/post-game breakdowns.\n\n### About This Competition\n\nThis dataset contains Next Gen Stats tracking data for running plays. You must use features known at the time when the ball is handed off (**TimeHandoff**) to forecast the yardage gained on that play (**PlayId**).\n\nBecause this is a time-series code competition that will be evaluated on future data, you will receive data and make predictions with a time-series API. This API provides plays in the time order in which they occurred in a game. Refer to the starter notebook here for an example of how to complete a submission."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Evaluation\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated on the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). For each PlayId, you must predict a cumulative probability distribution for the yardage gained or lost. In other words, each column you predict indicates the probability that the team gains <= that many yards on the play. \n\nThe CRPS is computed as follows:\n\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{199N} \\sum_{m=1}^{N} \\sum_{n=-99}^{99} (P(y \\le n) -H(n - Y_m))^2 $$\n\nwhere P is the predicted distribution, N is the number of plays in the test set, Y is the actual yardage and H(x) is the Heaviside step function (H(x)=1 for x≥0 and zero otherwise).\n\nThe submission will not score if any of the predicted values has\n\n$$ P(y \\le k) > P(y \\le k+1) $$\n\nfor any k (i.e. the CDF must be non-decreasing)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Competition Specific\nfrom kaggle.competitions import nflrush\n\n# Data Management\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n\n# Visualization Libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\n# Managing Warnings \nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Plot Figures Inline\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Extras\nimport math, string, os\n\n# View Available Files\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/train.csv', low_memory=False)\nprint(train_df.shape)\ntrain_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Columns\n\nEach row in the file corresponds to a single player's involvement in a single play.

This may be due to sweep plays where the rusher is traveling sideways as fast as possible to get around the defense before heading upfield.\n+ We see a larger number of yards gained when 10 yards are needed for a first down. That may be the result of a few different scenarios. Whenever a team gets a first down, they need to travel 10 yards from their current spot to gain another first down by default.\n   + Perhaps on first down, when a team's offense is rolling, they hand the ball off and gain a significant chunk of yards multiple times. \n   + Or perhaps when teams realize that the passing game isn't working, they hand the ball off on 3rd and ten and break a big run\n   + Or since more plays happen when 10 yards are needed for a first down, we're just seeing a much larger sample size of rushes that covers a wider span of outcomes.\n+ Few big rushing plays are seen when more than 20 yards are needed.
