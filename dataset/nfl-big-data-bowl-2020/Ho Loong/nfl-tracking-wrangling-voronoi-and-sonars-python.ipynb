In this walk-through, I do the following:\n\n1. Standardize player tracking coordinates so that offensive units are moving in the same direction throughout the entirety of the game, while also sharing tweaks that should be made regarding team names.\n\n2. Create a sample Voronoi diagram using tracking coordinates. \n\n3. Standardize the direction variable for the ball carrier, and provide video to represent of that standardization manifests itself within a play.\n\n4. Create angle charts for player movement at a snapshot of time within a play. \n\n5. Create sonar maps for player direction.\n\n## 1. Standardizing coordinates\n\nOne recommended technique for working with this data is to standardize play directions, so that the offensive team is always moving in the same direction. This idea is particularly important for this year's Big Data Bowl event on Kaggle, where many participants will look to engineer football-specific features. \n\nTo start off, let's read in the data, creating a dummy variable for plays moving left to right (`ToLeft`), as well as an indicator for whether or not the player is the ball carrier (`IsBallCarrier`). \n\nNext, I add in a few tweaks to account for different factors between the `PossessionTeam`/`FieldPosition` variables and the `HomeTeamAbbr`/`VisitorTeamAbbr`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys,os\n\nimport pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train  = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/train.csv')\ntrain['ToLeft'] = train.PlayDirection.apply(lambda play_direction:play_direction=='left')\ntrain['IsBallCarrier'] = train[['NflId','NflIdRusher']].apply(lambda row:row.NflId==row.NflIdRusher, axis=1)\n\nteam_abbr_map = {\n    'ARI':'ARZ',\n    'BAL':'BLT',\n    'CLE':'CLV',\n    'HOU':'HST'\n}\ntrain.VisitorTeamAbbr = train.VisitorTeamAbbr.apply(lambda vta:team_abbr_map[vta] if vta in team_abbr_map.keys() else vta)\ntrain.HomeTeamAbbr = train.HomeTeamAbbr.apply(lambda vta:team_abbr_map[vta] if vta in team_abbr_map.keys() else vta)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see what six plays look like.

Player direction\n\nNext, our goal is to make use of the `Direction` variable. The direction in which a player is moving is based on the change in his `X` and `Y` coordinates over time, and as shown in the [schema](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/data), this is relative to the side in which his team is moving and the movement of each play. \n\nThere are two primary reason for standardizing `Direction`.\n\nFirst, if we want to use player direction on its own as a variable, **a statistical model is going to have a difficult time untangling the raw data feed.** For example, 135 degrees and 315 degrees could be the same direction, or they could be different, depending on the `Direction` variabile, which indicates where the entire offensive unit is facing. \n\nSecond, standardizing directions is needed if we are to replicate the soccer paper ([link](http://www.lukebornn.com/papers/fernandez_ssac_2018.pdf)) referenced above. For example, identifying the **fraction of space in front of the ball carrier that the offense owns (or that the ball carrier owns)** would assuredly be a variable that would lead to more accurate model projections. This is potentially easier to parse out when direction is standardized.\n\nI'm going to standardize `Dir` as follows:\n\n- 0 degrees: the offensive player is moving completely to his left  \n- 90 degrees: the offensive player is moving straight ahead, towards opponent end zone\n- 180 degrees: the offensive player is moving completely to his right\n- 270 degrees: the offensive player is moving backwards, towards his own team's end zone (this is generally bad)\n\nFirst, I filter to only include the ball carrier (`IsBallCarrier`, as defined above). I later standardize direction for all players, but I'm starting with the ball carrier because his movement is likely most relevant to predictions.  \n\nNext, I make a histogram, faceted by `PlayDirection` to highlight the funny behavior of ball carrier directions.

In our code, a few aspects of the play line up:\n\n- `ToLeft == FALSE` and `PlayDirection == \"right\"`: the offense is moving right. Note that this is dependent on the angle of the camera at each home stadia, but here, it matches up\n- `X_std == 73.38` and `YardsFromOwnGoal == 78`. The offense started the play 78 yards from its own goalline, but Tolbert got the ball a few yards behind that mark. Were Tolbert to have been tackled right where he took the handoff, it would've been a loss of 4 or 5 yards (e.g., `Yards == -4`). Instead, he moved 14 yards past the line of scrimmage. In this example, the maximum yards gained for Tolbert would be (100-`YardsFromOwnGoal` = 22). \n- The standardized direction does not change from the original direction. 0 degrees would represent Tolbert moving directly to his left, 90 degrees would be Tolbert moving straight ahead, and 180 degrees would be Tolbert moving directly to his right. If Tolbert was at 270 degrees on this standardized variable, he'd be running the wrong way!\n\nHere's a second play."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_bc[df_bc.PlayId==20170910000081][['PlayId','DisplayName','Dir','ToLeft','PlayDirection','X_std','Y_std','YardsFromOwnGoal','Dir_std_1','Dir_std_2','Yards']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this play, Tolbert's teammate LeSean McCoy takes the ball and moves to his right.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/mBwPxbGLGNjpLSpenx/giphy.gif)\n\nEven though the same team has the ball in the same game as the play above, the offense is now moving right to left (`PlayDirection == \"left\")`. \n\nNext, despite the fact that the play occured in nearly the same spot on the field as the Tolbert carry above, the standardized `X_std == 19.35`, indicating that McCoy received the ball 19 yards from his own goal. In this example, the maximum yards gained for McCoy would be (100-`YardsFromOwnGoal` = 75). \n\nFinally, for McCoy's `Dir == 327.14`. This could be confusing to think about -- but when standardized, `Dir_std_2 == 147.14`, which means he's moving to his right while also moving upfield. \n\nAltogether, hopefully this clarifies some of how the standardized coordinates, yardline, and player direction (`Dir`) work on a football field. \n\n## 4. Angle charts using player direction\n\nTo show how the standardization of `Dir` would work for all players on a given play, let's expand across the larger data set of all players on the Mike Tolbert running play above. Each player will be shown with an arrow that corresponds to how fast he was moving, and in which direction, at the time of handoff. *Note*: speed (`S`, in yards per second) and direction (`Dir_std_2`, my standardized direction) are used to create each vector. R uses radians instead of degrees (hence the multiplication by `pi/180`), and I subtract each angle from 90 (`90-Dir_std_2)`) to ensure that the angles match the direction in which teams are moving on my figure. \n\nRoughly, the end of the arrow corresponds to where players are expected to end up a second after the handoff. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_2 = train_1.copy()\ntrain_2['Dir_std_1'] = train_2[['ToLeft','Dir']].apply(lambda row:row.Dir+360 if (row.ToLeft and row.Dir<90) else row.Dir, axis=1)\ntrain_2['Dir_std_1'] = train_2[['ToLeft','Dir','Dir_std_1']].apply(lambda row:row.Dir-360 if ((not row.ToLeft) and row.Dir>270) else row.Dir_std_1, axis=1)\ntrain_2['Dir_std_2'] = train_2[['ToLeft','Dir_std_1']].apply(lambda row:row.Dir_std_1-180 if row.ToLeft else row.Dir_std_1, axis=1)\ntrain_2['X_std_end'] = train_2[['Dir_std_2','X_std','S']].apply(lambda row:row.S*np.cos((90-row.Dir_std_2)*np.pi/180.)+row.X_std, axis=1)\ntrain_2['Y_std_end'] = train_2[['Dir_std_2','Y_std','S']].apply(lambda row:row.S*np.sin((90-row.Dir_std_2)*np.pi/180.)+row.Y_std, axis=1)\n\nsample_20170910001102 = train_2[train_2.PlayId==20170910001102].copy()\nsample_20170910001102","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nplt.suptitle(\"Playid:20170910001102\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Distance from offensive team's own end zone\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Y coordinate\")\n\nfor gp,chance in sample_20170910001102.groupby('PlayId'):\n    play_id = gp\n    rusher = chance[chance.NflId==chance.NflIdRusher].iloc[0]\n    offense = chance[chance.IsOnOffense]\n    defense = chance[~chance.IsOnOffense]\n    \n    plt.subplot(1,1,1)\n    i+=1\n    \n    x_min, x_max = chance.X_std.min()-5, chance.X_std.max()+5\n    y_min, y_max = chance.Y_std.min()-5, chance.Y_std.max()+5\n    plt.xlim(x_min,x_max)\n    plt.ylim(y_min,y_max)\n    \n    plt.scatter(offense.X_std,offense.Y_std,marker='o',c='green',s=55,alpha=0.5,label='OFFENSE')\n    plt.scatter(defense.X_std,defense.Y_std,marker='o',c='red',s=55,alpha=0.5,label='DEFENSE')\n    plt.scatter([rusher.X_std],[rusher.Y_std],marker='o',c='black',s=30,label='RUSHER')\n    \n    for idx, row in chance.iterrows():\n        _color='black' if row.IsBallCarrier else('green' if row.IsOnOffense else 'red')\n        plt.arrow(row.X_std,row.Y_std,row.X_std_end-row.X_std,row.Y_std_end-row.Y_std,width=0.05,head_width=0.3,ec=_color,fc=_color)\n    \n    for line in range(10,130,10):\n        plt.plot([line,line],[-100,100],c='silver',linewidth=0.8,linestyle='-')\n    \n    plt.plot([rusher.YardsFromOwnGoal,rusher.YardsFromOwnGoal],[-100,100],c='black',linewidth=1.5,linestyle=':')\n    plt.plot([10,10],[-100,100],c='black',linewidth=2)\n    plt.plot([110,110],[-100,100],c='black',linewidth=2)\n    \n    plt.title(play_id)\n    plt.legend()\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you review the Tolbert handoff above, each players' movement at handoff should look similar to what's depicted above. \n\n## 5.
