Indeed, the farther you're from the ball, the biggest influence you can have in terms of pitch covering. I reimplemented their function but I'm sure you could gain some insight by adapting it with \"NFL relevant\" values.\n* **v_5 update**: 2 main modifications: (1) I speed up the code by modifying calls to the dataframe (2-3 times faster but there's still room for improvement) ; (2) I created a class wrapping the functions defined in the first part, including the display of the pitch control visually (+ some typo fixes).
