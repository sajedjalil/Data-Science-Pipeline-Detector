Some of the code is borrowed or modified from [Rob Mula's](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/nfl-big-data-bowl-plotting-player-position) and [SRK's](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/simple-exploration-notebook-nfl) great notebooks.  \n\nI've included the test data collected via this simple notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/cpmpml/save-test\n\nOne initial but tricky issue when working with NFL player tracking data is that sometimes players are moving left to right, and other times they are moving right to left. One recommended technique for working with this data is to standardize play directions, so that the offensive team is always moving in the same direction. This idea is particularly important for this year's Big Data Bowl event on Kaggle, where many participants will look to engineer football-specific features. \n\nTo start off, let's read in the data, creating a dummy variable for plays moving left to right (`ToLeft`), as well as an indicator for whether or not the player is the ball carrier (`IsBallCarrier`). \n\nNext, we add in a few tweaks to account for different factors between the `PossessionTeam`/`FieldPosition` variables and the `HomeTeamAbbr`/`VisitorTeamAbbr`.\n\nLast, but not least, we shift direction so that cosine of direction maps to the X axis, and sine of direction maps to the Y axis.  We change both the unit from degrees to radians, but also the direction origin and the way direction increases. We'll see later that this matches what we could see on screen during the play."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\npd.options.display.max_columns = 100\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport datetime, tqdm\nfrom kaggle.competitions import nflrush\n\nimport math\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import Voronoi, voronoi_plot_2d","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/train.csv\", low_memory=False)\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/dsbowl2019-test/test.csv', low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"set(train.columns) - set(test.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test['Yards'] = np.NaN\ntrain = pd.concat((train, test[train.columns]), axis=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train['ToLeft'] = train.PlayDirection == \"left\"\ntrain['IsBallCarrier'] = train.NflId == train.NflIdRusher\n\ntrain.loc[train.VisitorTeamAbbr == \"ARI\", 'VisitorTeamAbbr'] = \"ARZ\"\ntrain.loc[train.HomeTeamAbbr == \"ARI\", 'HomeTeamAbbr'] = \"ARZ\"\n\ntrain.loc[train.VisitorTeamAbbr == \"BAL\", 'VisitorTeamAbbr'] = \"BLT\"\ntrain.loc[train.HomeTeamAbbr == \"BAL\", 'HomeTeamAbbr'] = \"BLT\"\n\ntrain.loc[train.VisitorTeamAbbr == \"CLE\", 'VisitorTeamAbbr'] = \"CLV\"\ntrain.loc[train.HomeTeamAbbr == \"CLE\", 'HomeTeamAbbr'] = \"CLV\"\n\ntrain.loc[train.VisitorTeamAbbr == \"HOU\", 'VisitorTeamAbbr'] = \"HST\"\ntrain.loc[train.HomeTeamAbbr == \"HOU\", 'HomeTeamAbbr'] = \"HST\"\n\ntrain['Dir_rad'] = np.mod(90 - train.Dir, 360) * math.pi/180.0\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see how plays are rendered here.
