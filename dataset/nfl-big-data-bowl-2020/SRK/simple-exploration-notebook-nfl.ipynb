The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world. \n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League)\n![NFL](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTZ6EI5slmj172qfcN4dTNKqEllvxJ1w5ARNo4sso0xVS5-qhu6)\n\n### Rules of NFL\nIf you are a newbie (just like me) to the world of NFL, there you can read about the basics from this discussion [thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/111945#latest-645419). \n\n### Competition Objective\nIn the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams’ offensive yardage comes from run plays. A running play or rushing play is a tactic in which the football is advanced up the field by a player running it rather than passing it. Competition is to develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. We are given the data when the ball is handed off (TimeHandoff) to forecast the yardage gained on that play.\n\n### Notebook objective\nObjective of the notebook is to explore the data and find some interesting insights along the way.\n\n### References:\nThis [wonderful kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/nfl-big-data-bowl-plotting-player-position) by Rob is the basis for this notebook\n\nLet us first look at the top few rows to understand the data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n\ndata_path = \"/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/\"\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(data_path + \"train.csv\", low_memory=False)\ntrain_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us first get to understand some basic information about the data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"The total number of games in the training data is {train_df['GameId'].nunique()}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of plays in the training data is {train_df['PlayId'].nunique()}\")\nprint(f\"The NFL seasons in the training data are {train_df['Season'].unique().tolist()}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Target Variable Analysis\n\nNow let us analyze the target variable (Yards) and see how it is distributed."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly import tools\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ntemp_df = train_df.query(\"NflIdRusher == NflId\")\nfig = px.histogram(temp_df, x=\"Yards\")\n\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    title=go.layout.Title(\n        text=\"Distribution of Yards (Target)\",\n        x=0.5\n    ),\n    font=dict(size=14),\n    width=800,\n    height=500,\n)\nfig.update_layout(layout)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* 2 Yards has the maximum count followed by 1 and 3 yards\n* The distribution looks normal with a right skewness.
