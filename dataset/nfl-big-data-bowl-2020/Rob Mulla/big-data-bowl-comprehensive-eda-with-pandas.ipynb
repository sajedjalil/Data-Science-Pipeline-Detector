You'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data. And the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current season’s game data as it plays out.*"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn')\ncolor_pal = [x['color'] for x in plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle']]\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100) # So we can see more columns\n\n# Read in the training data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/train.csv', low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30228069/how-to-display-the-value-of-the-bar-on-each-bar-with-pyplot-barh\ndef label_bars(ax, bars, text_format, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attaches a label on every bar of a regular or horizontal bar chart\n    \"\"\"\n    ys = [bar.get_y() for bar in bars]\n    y_is_constant = all(y == ys[0] for y in ys)  # -> regular bar chart, since all all bars start on the same y level (0)\n\n    if y_is_constant:\n        _label_bar(ax, bars, text_format, **kwargs)\n    else:\n        _label_barh(ax, bars, text_format, **kwargs)\n\n\ndef _label_bar(ax, bars, text_format, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attach a text label to each bar displaying its y value\n    \"\"\"\n    max_y_value = ax.get_ylim()[1]\n    inside_distance = max_y_value * 0.05\n    outside_distance = max_y_value * 0.01\n\n    for bar in bars:\n        text = text_format.format(bar.get_height())\n        text_x = bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2\n\n        is_inside = bar.get_height() >= max_y_value * 0.15\n        if is_inside:\n            color = \"white\"\n            text_y = bar.get_height() - inside_distance\n        else:\n            color = \"black\"\n            text_y = bar.get_height() + outside_distance\n\n        ax.text(text_x, text_y, text, ha='center', va='bottom', color=color, **kwargs)\n\n\ndef _label_barh(ax, bars, text_format, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attach a text label to each bar displaying its y value\n    Note: label always outside. otherwise it's too hard to control as numbers can be very long\n    \"\"\"\n    max_x_value = ax.get_xlim()[1]\n    distance = max_x_value * 0.0025\n\n    for bar in bars:\n        text = text_format.format(bar.get_width())\n\n        text_x = bar.get_width() + distance\n        text_y = bar.get_y() + bar.get_height() / 2\n\n        ax.text(text_x, text_y, text, va='center', **kwargs)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Description\n- Each row represents a player at a given moment in time.\n- Each 22 players participating in a given play have a row.\n\nFrom the official description:\n```\nEach row in the file corresponds to a single player's involvement in a single play.\nThe dataset was intentionally joined (i.e. denormalized) to make the API simple.\nAll the columns are contained in one large dataframe which is grouped and provided by PlayId.\n```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Yards *The target we are trying to predict*\nIt's always smart to take a close look at the variable we are trying to predict."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.groupby('PlayId').first()['Yards'] \\\n    .plot(kind='hist',\n          figsize=(15, 5),\n          bins=50,\n          title='Distribution of Yards Gained (Target)')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Yards gained by Down"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(15, 8), sharex=True)\nn = 0\nfor i, d in train.groupby('Down'):\n    d['Yards'].plot(kind='hist',\n                    bins=30,\n                   color=color_pal[n],\n                   ax=axes[n],\n                   title=f'Yards Gained on down {i}')\n    n+=1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Yards gained by Distance-to-Gain\nWe can see that there appears to be a increase in the average yards gained as the distance to gain increases.
