Conclusion\n\nFrom this EDA, some of our question in the beginning are answered, at least in overview. \n1. Is working in Large Company more profitable than Small Company or vice versa? From this dataset, one of the data that can answer it is from point 7. Working in larger companies give higher opportunity to get higher compensation, but doesn't means smaller companies can't give it. \n2. Is fresher possible to go to the Large Company? Or perhaps small companies tend to only accept experienced professional? From EDA point 4 and 6.3, we find that it's very-very possible for fresher to be Data Professional both in smaller and larger companies. But just for information, larger companies tend to have more experienced than smaller companies.\n3. What about the exact job, is it different between them? From point 4 and 5, we found that it's not really different. But to note from poin 6.2, larger companies tend to have larger proportion of well established ML methods user. On the other hand, smaller companies tend to be more likely still start exploring ML methods or event don't use ML methods at all. So, I think we can consider it whether we want to learn about ML methods from advanced users or follow the company's learning from scratch.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 9.
