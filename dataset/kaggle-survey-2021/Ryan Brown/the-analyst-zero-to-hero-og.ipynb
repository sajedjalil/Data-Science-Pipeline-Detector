Option 3 could also feasibly be performed by someone whose primary goal is analytical, such applying a base model as part of an analysis to make a decision for or against ML investment in a certain area. Both of these tasks could be performed by a technically advanced analyst who's more end-to-end in their analysis. \n\nHowever, Options 4, 5, and 6 require a much more intricate knowledge of complex machine learning, seem less likely to be supporting an analytical workflow, and are tasks that at most companies have dedicated employees for.

This could potentially be due to the fact that analysts are younger and have slightly fewer years of education (on average), but a simple linear regression model shows that even when controlling for these factors, analysts have 1.67 fewer years of coding experience.

Within the dataset, analysts don't have complex ML tasks as an important part of their work, so they might not need as much coding experience. Additionally, as described by Benn Stancil in [this article](https://benn.substack.com/p/analytics-is-at-a-crossroads), being an analytical thinker and performing analytical work goes beyond the coding requirements. Although the problem he describes is still alive and well, it's cool to see some of the sentiment about what should qualify someone as an \"analyst\" reflected in the survey.\n\nWith the ~2 years worth of SP that you've saved on coding experience, you should consider putting SP in one of the following hidden areas:\n- Additional Bachelor's or Master's degrees in textured, complex areas, such
