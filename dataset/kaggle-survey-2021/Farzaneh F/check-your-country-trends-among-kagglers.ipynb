You can change it to any other arbitrary country and see how it deviates from rest of the world or from a specific other region. <br>\n- In this report I will initially show the differences and similarities of kaggle respondents in age, gender, education, years of experience and their current role at work. <br>\n- Then we'll see how their choices for programming language, development environments, hosted notebooks and computer vision and NLP techiques differ. <br>\n- We would also asses how the team and company size differs in different regions and countries. Also how different companies approach machine learning and use cloud computing platforms together with data storage products. <br>\n<br>\nHope you find this analysis interesting.

Big corporation employees however report that they have well established ML methods(i.e. models in production for more than 2 years). <br>\nIn US, the respondents relatively work more for big corporations with 10k+ employees compared to rest of the world. The plot indicates that more companies in US regardless of the number of their employees have well established ML models compared to the rest of the world. <br> \nIn SE Asia, respondents relatively work more for companies with 1k-10k employees. More relative respondents also state that they use ML methods for generating insights, but do not put working models in production. <br>\nIn Europe also, companies relatively have more well established ML methods with models in production compared to the rest of the world. <br>\nIn India, the respondents have less deviation from the rest of the wrold.

These aspects include their demographics (age and sex), eduction, programming experience, job roles and their machine learning experience. <br>\nAfter recognizing these groups of people, we tried to examine different practices among these groups. This analysis is useful for people to get a perspective about what programming languages, development environments and hosted notebooks are popular globaly, in a specific region or in a specific country of their interest. A comparision for the popularity of NLP versus computer vision is presented as well. <br>\nWe later tried to understand the current ecosystems at data science jobs in industries. This analysis gives insights about the data science teams size, company size and their approach to machine learning techniques as well as mostly used cloud computing platforms and data storage products. <br>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hope you find this analysis interesting!
