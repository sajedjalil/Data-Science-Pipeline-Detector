I felt the same way because when i started learning data science i was just going through processes without even knowing where i am going, i thought becoming professional in python programming and machine learning is the best way to start. but then, i suddently reliaze that i am wrong you can't just be a professional in a short period of time, professionality comes with great experience. Therefore, as a beginner on my career path, all i need was a level of familiarity not becoming a professional. which tools to learn, what techniques to focused on, will be a good question.\nThat is why i thought that i could create this guide which could help Beginners starting on data science field.\n\nSo, in this notebook, with the aid of **Kaggle Data science survey which present a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning the survey was live from 09/01/2021 which took one month and end up with 25,973 responses. the result include raw numbers about who is working with data, what happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best way for new data scientist to break into the field.** I will like to **highlight some steps and techniques for beginners to learn** in other to make the learning processes easier and the journey to be straightforward for them. I will also cover some important aspects in the field of data science itself, what is data science, Future of data science and careers or roles in the field , by going through the responses provided by kagglers on the survey. at the meantime i will be using a simple **Bar chart for visualization** to show some useful information.\n\nbefore we start lets's know something about Kaggle\n\nWhat is Kaggle: kaggle is an **online community of data scientist and machine learning practitioners**. kaggle allows users to find and publish a data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data science enviroment, work with other data scientist and machine learning engineers,\n\nLet's get started!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n* [1.
