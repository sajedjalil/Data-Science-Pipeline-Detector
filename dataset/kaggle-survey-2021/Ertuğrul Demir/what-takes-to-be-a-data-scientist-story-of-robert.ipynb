Introduction</div>\n- Hello fellow kagglers! In this notebook we're going to analyse the latest <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span>  user survey and by doing so we're going to get some insights.\n- I'm planning to go through feature(question) by feature and take closer look those features to inspect their relationships with previous features. So it's gonna take a while to finish this notebook with all features involved. I'm planning to update it regulary whenever I have free time, I hope you like it!\n\n- This notebook will consist of two main parts:\n    - First part will be about a general look of a participant, we are going to find about an averege <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> user.\n    - In second part I plan to guide through more specialized parts of a data science with a randomly selected person from these instances we inspected in first part, this randomly selected imaginary character will be named <span style=\"color:#FF0000;;font-weight:bold\"> Robert </span> don't ask why yet :) you'll get to know about him in second part and we will try to find best path for an aspiring data scientist...\n\n\n- Let's get started...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div class=\"section_title\">2. The Data</div>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UlXkI3O.png\" style=\"height: 180; width: 100%; object-fit: cover;\"/>\n\n- It all begins with the data, without it we can't tell the story... Imagine being a medieval bard, he needs to travel around to listen common folk stories, tavern by tavern, village by village and then he creates an epic to tell the tale. In essence we do similar thing, maybe it's not as cool as bards... Oh well...\n- Altough our stories might not be that epic we still can create some cool stuff with the help of some items in our toolbelt.\n- Finding and creating meaningful relationships between data points where people can't see at first look sounds like some kind of magic. With the right data and tools we can even forecast the future! How do you like them apples bards! \n- So story telling from the data what makes us unique in a way and that's what I'm going to try in rest of this notebook.

He still identifies himself as a student. He's been interested in programming and data science lately but didn't have formal education to get to know about these in school. So he decided to learn programming from online courses on his own. He found out Python is very popular for Data Science and he started studying about it. After couple months of courses (1< years of experience) he feels competent enough to look at Data Science stuff using Python. He jumps on <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> to play with toy datasets like Titanic, Housing Prices etc. He gets more familiar to work on <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> (jupyter) notebooks but with all of the new stuff about data science pouring over him like Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Frameworks, Algorithms, CV/NLP, he gets little bit overwhelmed and lost... He doesn't know what to study and in which order he should start learning. Even he learns about some stuff, he still gets confused about his future job, is he going to be a Data Analyst? Data Scientist? Or Machine Learning Engineer? Or something else... He doesn't know, they all seem similar to him and with his background/skills he doesn't know which role he perfectly fits. What is going to be his daily work responsibilities, what does he need to know to fulfill his duties, what does he need to learn to advance in his career. Will his salary going to be satisfying for him, or did he make a mistake by choosing Data Science field? What if he made a bad decision, or he's going to make one? Robert gets stressed and confused lately... Maybe with help of the data itself we can help poor little Robert, shall we?*\n\n\n<img src='https://image.freepik.com/free-vector/worried-concept-illustration_114360-3729.jpg' width=600>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"1\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/worried-concept-illustration_10386551.htm\">Worried by \"Stories\" - www.freepik.com</a></font></div>  ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div class=\"section_title\">2.5 Time to Specialize</div>\n\n- In this chapter we're going take a closer look to the needs of data related roles, what libraries, frameworks, algorithms etc. you need to learn to seperate you from others who already can code.\n- What makes you a data specialist?

It's a great tool for prototyping, I forgot how many times I started prototyping a solution for a problem and at the end found out sklearn is more than enough...\n    - Tensorflow is a library for fast numerical computings which we need them for Deep Learning. It's has low level abilities to customize your workflow as you want.\n    - Keras is higher level API for Tensorflow, it wraps most common deep learning tasks aiming for easier usage. (You can still do low level stuff though using funtional or subclassing API's)\n    - Pytorch is somewhere between these two above, again it's an open source ML library for mainly deep learning tasks. People usually say it has more \"Pythonic\" style...\n     - You can think of PyTorch Lightning like a Keras for Pytorch, not exactly same but it's aiming for similar purposes.\n    - JAX is relatively a young framework, it's designed for high-performance numerical computing. People like to call it \"NumPy on steroids\" :) I find that description pretty accurate too :)\n    - Xgboost, LightGBM and Catboost are similar libraries, aiming to get maximum use of gradient boosting.

Followed by Research Scientists and Sofware Engineers (Interesting one)...\n- Gradient boosting algorithms are more common than other role groups among Data Scientists.\n- It seems statisticians are one of the least interested groups in machine learning (after Developer Relations), I was expecting little big jump at Tidymodels for this group but it seems even \"None\" group had sharper spike.\n\n*So Robert... I heard you getting interested specially in Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles. You better start learning Scikit-learn then, as you can see it's really popular and in demand. Also, like I mentioned above it has great workflow standard, so after getting familiar with it you can learn other libraries much faster. For example some popular libraries like Xgboost, LightGBM already having sklearn interface too, so after getting familiar with sklearn you can start using these too in no time! Good lad! If you want to advance further I'd suggest taking a look at the TensorFlow and especially Keras, because of it's higher level API and having some similarities with sklearn workflow, it would be good starting point. If I recall correctly Keras has sklearn wrapper too. To get little bit of theory and practical knowledge you can get help of some books. For Scikit-learn I'd recommend \"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists\" from Andreas C. Müller, for TensorFlow and Keras you can take a look at \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\" from Aurélien Géron, in that book you can get some solid knowledge for sklearn too. If you want something Keras specific you can read \"Deep Learning with Python\" from François Chollet. Getting familiar with these going to take some time but after that you can start learning PyTorch if you like to, it's a great framework and lately on the rise, many research codes are published in PyTorch format so it's nice to know.

As I told you in previous chapter best way to do this is doing exploratory data analysis and one of the best tools going to help you with this is visualization. That's why it's recommended to learn matplotlib/seaborn for you. When you understand the data you can move to the next steps like asking the questions: \"What can I do with this data, how can I use this information to create something useful, can I train a model to predict stuff with this data\". If you start asking these kind of questions you're on the right track, but again you need to get hang of the data first, then the questions are getting more specialized. After exploring, to answer some of these questions you going to use machine learning. It's going to take lot's of prototyping and as I mentioned in previous chapter, Sckit-learn going to help you a lot with this. You don't want to create complex models before you reach satisfactory results with more traditional models. If you manage to do this then you'll get to next step where you need to improve existing model, maybe doing some research to learn about state of the art stuff then deploy the model etc. Maybe you are little bit unexperienced for some of these but it's good to know and by the way please stop asking me about the wage, we'll get there...*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div class=\"subsection_detail\">2.6.1.2 ML Experience and Responsibilities</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# getting percentages and plotting them in styled heatmap\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 10))\nsns.heatmap(df10.groupby('For how many years have you used machine learning methods?')[activities].mean(),\n            xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True, cmap='YlOrBr', annot=True, linewidths=0.005, linecolor='black', annot_kws={\"fontsize\":14}, fmt='.4f', cbar=False)\nplt.title('Percentage of Work Activities by Experience', fontname = 'monospace', weight='bold')\nplt.ylabel('Experience in ML (# years)', fontname = 'monospace', weight='semibold')\nplt.xlabel('Work Responsibilities', fontname = 'monospace', weight='semibold')\nplt.xticks(rotation=60, ha='right', fontsize=10)\nplt.yticks(fontsize=10)\n\nlabels = [item.get_text() for item in ax.get_xticklabels()]\nlabels = ['Analyze & Understand Data', ' Build & Run Data Infrastructure', ' Build ML Prototypes for New Areas', 'Build/Run ML Services', 'Experiment/Improve Existing ML Models',\n         'Researching Advances in ML', 'None of these are Important', 'Other']\nax.set_xticklabels(labels)\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T14:19:54.62032Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T14:19:54.620794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T14:19:56.711875Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T14:19:54.620753Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T14:19:56.711044Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Well...

He learnt some basics of libraries here and there, but he made an one fatal mistake: He went too fast; he started learning one library and jumped other one in no time before getting hang of the previous library. For example he learnt sklearn's Logistic Regression only in practice and went for Neural Networks without understanding how's the Logistic Regression or Perceptron works, now he's trying to work on Convolutional Neural Networks. Luckily after some job applications he found a \"Machine Learning Engineer\" role, he received a contract and he signed it.

He methodically planned his roadmap, instead of aiming for unattainable targets and rapid jumps he structured his learning path. He didn't move to the next step before he gets comfortable with previous concept. He learned libraries well both in practice and theory, maybe he didn't have chance to work on \"Cool\" stuff where they attract big hype lately but he knows how to learn them and he has broad idea about how do they work. For example he doesn't know how to work with transformer language models yet, but he is really comfortable working with tf-idf or count vectorizers. He also learned about word embeddings so he does know about importance contextuality of a word in a sentence too. With this way he can understand shortcomings of old methods and how're newer methods fixing them. He carefully selected his applications, he went for job adverts where the requirements are nicely fits to his profile. After some time he got his first job offer from a decent company where the company knows about what they need. His job title is \"Junior Data Scientist\". His daily activites are already specified, he's happy to work, if he doesn't know the concept or encounters a problem he knows he has decent mentors to help him.

I spent decent amount of my free time from work to finish this one, but I think it's worth it, I learnt a lot while preparing this notebook myself! I just want to thank <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> for the enjoyable dataset to work on. Also would like to thank whole <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> community for their support and the contributions, I learnt lots of tricks on <span style=\"color:#00FFFF;\"> kaggle </span> from countless number of public notebooks in past, I hope you find something in this one too!\n\nI tried to explain most of the charts as simple as possible, some parts might be little bit confusing for beginners but I believe there is a limited number of them and again I tried to explain them as clear as possible. But feel free to ask me personally if you have a question about any of them.\n\nI might have used many plots, it can get tiresome to interpret them in one go at some point, you don't have to rush; you can take your time or just choose the ones where you're interested in, I added chapters for this purpose. I also put emphasis on explain them by markdowns, therefore they can be easier to read.\n\nThroughout the notebook I endeavor to stay positive, although I have seen some red flags around some statistics (like gender gap, income gap or unbalanced role distributions, role hypes etc.) but I tried to encourage beginners, because I know it can be hard to get into data science field these days...\n\nI aimed to combine my personal experiences/opinions with my interpretations from the data, some might find them subjective but I tried to stay objective as much as I can while trying to see positive side of the things...\n\n**About Robert...**\n\nRobert was a randomly generated character, I choose his attributes randomly (with weights) from the data itself. He was a fitting character for most of the participants, so while guiding him through the notebook I tried to help beginners who's in similar shoes.\n\nAbout the suggestions, I know there isn't a single absolute right way to get successful in your data science career but as I said I tried to share my personal opinions/experiences with the help of data, if you find some of these suggestions not fitting for you, don't worry about it, I'm pretty sure there are many many more ways to get your goals done...\n\nMy main point here is you need to make an effort to do something differs you from the others in this harsh competitive industry, you can see things are not fair most of the time in our world, but if you motivated enough I'm pretty sure you'll get rewarded at the end of your journey. Some of you might find this too optimistic (Well I get pessimist too most of the time :/ ) but with methodical and planned approach I think it's achieveable...\n\nInstead of giving a single outcome at the end I choose to give you three possible endings. I leave what outcome Robert is going to get for your imagination but I hope he's happy :)\n\nLastly I want to add that I'm still in early parts of my journey myself, there's lot to learn and share in future, but humbly I wanted to share what I think on this subject. I love sharing spirit of this community and I'm really glad to be part of it...\n\n**I hope you enjoyed this notebook and found something useful for you. Even one person finds this work useful, that would make me more than happy! Thank you all for reading :)**","metadata":{}}]}
