Introduction\nSelf-directed learning has always been a cornerstone of the data science and machine learning industry (as anyone who has spent hours crawling through documentation on APIs, packages and SDKs can testify!). \n\nThis has become even more critical since the advent of COVID-19 as employees, job hunters and students scramble to develop skills to increase adaptability and flexibility in the workplace and job market. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, online self-directed learning has seen a 3x increase globally, with certain regions like Asia seeing a 5x increase (Cornerstone on Demand 2021).\n\nSo we can agree that self-directed learning is key, but for any would-be learner this now begs the question of \"What do I learn?\".\n\nA 2014 white paper by CEB revealed that in the average organisation, 45% of all learning delivered ends up not being applied, with a 2004 study putting that number closer to 80-85% (Ken Phillips 2016). That's astronomical!\n\nThere is no doubt that the question of **\"What** do I learn?\" in an age where information is so abundant, is the most important question of all.\n\n# 2. Our Goal\nThis notebook will serve as a practical guide for self-directed learners, to help them identify the areas of study relevant to them by utilising a data driven approach.\n\nSection 4 \"Information on Job Titles\" has been designed for individuals looking to select or switch career paths. By examining the various attributes (such as salary and job activities) of different careers within the data science and machine learning industry, individuals can identify which may best suit them to begin their self-learning journey.\n\nSection 5 \"Breakdown of Skills/Tools/Methods by Job Title\" has been designed to help individuals select areas of study that will be relevant to them based on the career path they are pursuing (or if they don't know what career yet then they can see what areas of study will be useful across the different careers).\n\n# 3. The Dataset\n\n## 3.1 Description\nThe dataset used comes from an industry wide survey for data science and machine learning held from 09/01/2021 to 10/04/2021 with 25,973 valid responses from 171 countries and territories.\n\nQuestions were asked as a multichoice with many allowing for multiple selection.\nGo to https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2021/data for a full breakdown of the survey and the raw data.\n\n## 3.2 Managing Bias\nAs the data is collected via survey rather than random sample, we must be aware of the inherent bias with this method. \n\nOne major concern was the bias in the countries in which respondents were based. As such we have avoided making sum-based comparisons between countries such as \"number of respondents from India with a master’s degree compared to number of respondents from Australia with a master’s degree\" and instead have looked at these as a proportion relative to the country, for example \"Of the respondents from India, what proportion have a master’s degree\". \n\nAnother concern was a difference in respondents from each job title, once again we have used proportions rather than sum comparisons. For example, rather than asking \"How many data scientists use Python\" we ask \"What proportion of data scientists use Python\".\n\nThe exception to this is section 4.3 \"Industry Breakdown\". This is as job titles with lower respondents would skew the visualisation when comparing across industry, additionally it is useful to see the respondents broken down by industry and job title.\n\n## 3.3 Processing The Data Set\nAs the data was already pre-processed (see \"kaggle_survey_2021_methodology.pdf\" in the \"supplementary data\" folder of the dataset), we only needed to pre-process the data relative to our objective. Given that the objective of the notebook was to look at areas of study based on what is used by industry professionals, respondents who answered \"Student\" or \"Currently Not Employed\" to Question 5 \"Select the title most similar to your current role (or most recent title if retired)\", were removed from the dataset, leaving us with 17,182 valid respondents.\n\nAn additional note on data quality is the presence of null values for some multiple select answers, whilst one option was to potentially impute the option of \"None\" where a question was not answered, this runs the risk of skewing the data as we cannot guarantee that \"None\" was the intended answer, as such the null values have not been changed. On the bubble charts in section 5, the size of the bubble and the scale on the right of the graph gives and rough indication of what proportion of survey respondents provided used any specific item.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \nrawdf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2021/kaggle_survey_2021_responses.csv', low_memory=False)\n\n# Clear Question description row\ndf = rawdf.iloc[1:]\n\n# drop students and unemployed respondents\ndf = df[~df['Q5'].isin(['Student','Currently not employed'])]","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T12:04:13.978963Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T12:04:13.979198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T12:04:15.509054Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T12:04:13.97916Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T12:04:15.508265Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" \n# 4. Information on Job Titles: Helping you Select a Career Path\nThe purpose of this section is to help familiarise you with some of the available career paths in the data science and machine learning space and help find which will best suit you. To achieve this goal, for each job title provided we will look at a brief description of the job, the expected salary in each country, a breakdown of jobs in different industries and the day-to-day activities of each job title.\n\n## 4.1 Job Descriptions\nBelow descriptions are modified and extended from [Seek Australia](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/)\n### Business Analyst\nBusiness Analysts are responsible for reviewing and analysing business decisions and processes, as well as communicating technical information back to the business and shareholders. Analysts work across a large range of departments and industries.\n\n### DBA / Database Engineer\nDatabase engineers are responsible for an organisation’s database management. They assess business and user requirements and plan, configure and maintain custom databases and their accompanying documentation and protocols for the business.\n\n### Data Analyst\nData Analysts help organisations identify ways to reduce costs and find opportunities for improving business revenue. Data Analysts collect and analyse data from within the business. Analysts are responsible for taking data and their findings and transferring this to actionable plans for the business.\n\n### Data Engineer\nData Engineers develop ways to store and access large amounts of data. Data engineers design and maintain data architectures that enable easier access and interpretation of data for the business and shareholders.\n\n### Data Scientist\nData Scientists look for patterns in the raw business data and use this to find trends and patterns to generate insights into real-world problems and to find possible solutions for these problems.\n\n### Developer Relations/Advocacy\nDeveloper Relations involves working with business shareholders and developers to assist in planning and setting expectations for projects. Advocates are typically experts in their field/company and promote their product.\n\n### Machine Learning Engineer\nMachine Learning Engineers are experts in AI and machine learning models. ML engineers design, build and test models. Also, verifying data quality is part of their job as it is important that the ML models are being trained with quality and accurate data.\n\n### Product Manager\nProduct Manager's identify the needs of the business or shareholder and ensure products designed will meet these needs and requirements. The manager also ensures their team is working in line with the business’s goals.\n\n### Program/Project Manager\nLike product managers, this position involves ensuring that the program/project output of the team they lead, is matching the needs and expectations of the business or customer. \n\n### Research Scientist\nResearch Scientist's design and undertake experiments and trials.

Keep in mind your choice for section 5 as you can tailor your self-directed learning towards the career you wish to pursue.\n\n# 5. Breakdown of Skills/Tools/Methods by Job Title\nThe purpose of this section is to help identify where to focus your self-directed learning based on your career path.\n\nMost of the information for this section is presented as bubble charts, with the colour of the bubble showing the use of a specific item proportionate to other items for each Job Title, and the size of the bubble showing the use of an item relative to the number of respondents for each job title. If that's a little confusing this example of how to use it might help.\n\nSay you want to be a Machine Learning Engineer; we can see in terms of programming languages (section 5.2.1) that Python is the most used as it is coloured yellow and comparatively the circle is quite large. Note that the size of the circle and the scale on the right of the chart give us an indication of how many respondents answered the question. Now let's look at computer vision methods (section 5.3.3), we can see that for the Machine Learning Engineer, most respondents who answered the question said they use \"Image classification and other general-purpose networks\", but the bubble is smaller and the scale on the right doesn't go as high. So, what does this mean? It means that less respondents that said they were Machine Learning Engineers selected the image classification option (based on the scale we can assume less than 50%) when compared to the number that selected the Python option.\n\nSo how do we use this information? Remembering the goal is to identify what to learn and in what order. If you already have experience with tools, you'll need to factor that in (as well as current demand in your workplace). To make it simple we recommend:\n1. Creating a list of 1 tool/method/skill from each section/chart, based on your career path.\n2. Order the list by the size of the bubble/scale, with Programming Language first (5.2.1) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) second (5.2.2). \n\nFor example, if your career path is data scientist you might start with Python --> Jupyter Notebook --> Matplotlib --> Scikit-Learn --> Linear/Logistic Regression --> etc.\n\nEssentially, you're making a list of what's relevant to you and learning the most used first (larger bubbles).\n\nThis section categorises items into Learning Tools, Basic Tools, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Data Storage and Big Data, and Business Intelligence\n\n\n\n## 5.1 Learning Tools\nThere are many tools available to you online that provide you with the opportunity to learn/refine your data science skills.

Closing Remarks\n\nReturning to our original question of \"What do I study?\", hopefully this notebook has provided you with the necessary information to begin your self-directed learning journey, to ensure your time spent learning is best utilised.\n\nWhilst what you choose to study will vary depending on career path, if the goal is to maintain employability by ensuring flexibility, then it may be wise to focus on areas that are used across multiple careers (such as Python programming language).\n\nOtherwise, if learning from the beginning and wishing to break into an industry it is wise to focus on what the data tells us, by looking at what are the most used tools/skills for your respective career. As you continue to learn you can return to this notebook to determine what area of study in which to challenge yourself next.\n\n# References\nCornerstone 2021, *What today's self-directed learning trends tell us about the value of modern learning content*, published 12 May 2021, <https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/resources/article/what-todays-self-directed-learning-trends-tell-us-about-the-value-of-modern-learning-content/>\n\nKen Phillips 2016, 'How Much is Scrap Learning Costing Your Organisation', *Association for Talent Development*, blog, published 10 August 2016,<https://www.td.org/insights/how-much-is-scrap-learning-costing-your-organization>","metadata":{}}]}
