Meanwhile, suppose some our German respondents (median \\\\$70k) are paying 1,000 dollars to live in Belgium. If all expenses match the difference of rent, then it may in fact be better for one's wallet to live in Belgium despite the lower salary!\n\nTo get a view of which country offers the most \"bang for your buck\" we need to understand comparative prices in our respondents areas.

Well, it turns out the Big Mac is actually a reasonably accurate barometer of the difference in prices between localities.

It's been a joy to pull together this notebook and I hope you learnt something. Feel free to ask questions on anything below in the comments\n\nHere's a quick summary of what we've seen:\n1. Salary, both absolute and based on purchasing power can vary greatly on location with Japan and the United States standing out.\n2. Don't travel to Switzerland if you want a Big Mac..\n3. Every field has its share of high income earners\n4. High income earners are generally more experienced, more educated, and show a penchant for learning. Luckily for those of us chasing the greenback, **these aren't qualities you're born with, but things obtainable by all of us through effort and dedication.**\n\nThanks to Kaggle for collecting all these responses! \n\n### Further reading ###\n1.
