The survey was live from 09/01/2021 to 10/04/2021, and after cleaning the data they finished with 25,973 responses!**\n\n**There's a lot to explore here. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. Kaggle have published the data in as raw a format as possible without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset.

Being a student myself, sometimes I wish if there was some way one could know what methodologies,hardwares,language,coding skills etc. are needed in real day to day life of a data scientist, a student could be more clear of the sequence he/she must start learning. Also, this comaparisons will give an idea to teachers and eductors of data science, the demand various technologies and thus help the students properly with no ambiguity.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Methodology\n\n**With the help of EDA using graphs let's find an overall similar and dissimilar practices among professionals and students. Finally we can find new ways how students can be guided on the correct path to become a good professional in any subset of data science. I have used pandas for data manipulation and extraction , numpy for numerical operations(if needed) , plotly for easy visualization(interactive graphs).

Storing this data economically and securely is one of the top priorities of organization which is where Cloud comes into picture.  This has given rise to the trend of hiring skilled data analysts,  data engineers and above all data scientists.Apart from various skills which a data scientist must possess like analysis, statistics and programming, he/she is also expected to work on newer platforms in which the organization stores data.
