The metric ranks each area, with merit given to the areas with the highest number of respondents. \n\nThis metric was selected with the hypothesis that a ‘Kaggle hub talent cluster' may bring similar benefits as those documented in research papers about business clusters. \n\n##### \n*  Respondents per Capita Award\n\nThe Respondent per Capita metric was created to the number of 2021 Kaggle survey respondents, for the geographic area population. This metric avoids bias to countries which have a large population.\n\nThe metric gives merit to areas that have the highest respondents per head. As this could indicate the area has a high enthusiasm for data!\n##### \n* Gender Inclusivity Award\n\nThe Gender Inclusivity metric was created to show what areas had the highest number of respondents to the 2021 Kaggle survey that reported their gender as woman, non - binary and prefer to self-describe. \n\nThis metric gave merit to areas which had the highest proportion of respondents that identified as one of those 3 categories. This metric was to countries that had the highest gender inclusivity, as we assumed diversity in the workplace would bring value to the data team. Particularly in the data industry, where bias in models is important. \n##### \n* Machine Learning Award\n\nThis metric shows of the respondents for an area stated they had 3+ years of experience using machine learning methods. This method was selected to show areas which have a high proportion of highly talented data expertise. \n\nThis metric gave merit to areas that had the highest proportion of respondents that reported this level of expertise.\n##### \n* Future Talent Award\n\nThis metric was created to show what areas had the highest number of respondents for that area that were under 25 years old. This metric gave merit to those which had the highest proportion of respondents under the age of 25. \n\nThis metric was created, as areas with a high concentration of young talent, may develop talent of the future. \n\n##### \n* Polyglot Award\n\nThe final metric create was the polyglot award. A polyglot being those which have multiple programming languages skills. This metric gave preference to areas with the highest mean polyglot levels. \n\nThis metric was selected to compare how adaptable the skillset of an area is. Where the metric give merit to areas with the highest mean polyglot level. \n##### \n* Overall, 2021 Kaggle Survey Geographic Showdown Champions\n\nFinally, we reach the stage to analyse who the winners of the overall 2021 Kaggle survey data geographic champions are! How exciting! \n\nThe winners were calculated by adding the rank they scored in each category together, with equal weighting given to each.  With the winner being the areas that scored the overall lowest total score. \n\nWho shall it be?

Fun. \n\nThis project was completed in python, to allow for reproducible results. \n\nThe result of each award is shown with leader boards. Where each award has its own leader board, and the Overall 2021 Kaggle Geographic Champion leader board is shown at the end. These leader boards show the rank each country achieved in the competition. In total there are 64 countries in the 2021 Kaggle Survey Dataset. The countries which perform the best will rank the highest. Therefore, a rank of 1 show cases they are gold medallist for this award. Each leader board is designed to show-off the gold, silver and bronze awardees with the use of colour. \n\nOur analysis makes use of sunburst charts, to visualise countries which preform poorly in a particular award. The outside circle of the sunburst shows all the countries, and the inner circle shows the continents. Where the countries with the largest wedge perform the worst. A colour scheme is also used, so that the poorer the ranking the warmer the colour becomes, with dark maroon being the worst ranking. The sunburst charts are used to help visualize countries that have room for improvement 😊.\n\nThe project results are also displayed on interactive globes, which were created with Plotly. Where a user can spin and play with the globe to view the results. As well as being fun, the decision to plot the results on a globe was taken to avoid bias. This is due to the cartographic design challenge of plotting the Earth, an ellipsoid object, on a 2D plane such as a piece of paper. As depending on the projection one can increase the look of the size of an area, but on the same effect decrease the size of another. Historically, maps emphasised the United Kingdom, during the British Empire, whilst making countries closer to the equator seem smaller. Bringing bias to how data is represented. Which of course we try to mitigate and to challenge techniques with may induce it. A good book to read on this is ‘How to Lie with Maps’ by Mark Monmonier. For this project we opted to centre the globe on the winning country for the award. \n\nThe project also uses a variety of other types of visualisations throughout, which are explained, as we go. 😊 So let’s go!

The award was created to give credit to countries with the most absolute respondents.  With gold medal position (rank 1) being awarded to the country with the most respondents. Hence the higher the rank the worse a country has performed. Just like golf! 😊 \n\n A report by Stitch Data stated that globally around 11,4000 data scientists are currently employed by companies on LinkedIn with around 60,2000 associated records of professional experiences and an estimate of 254,600 records of skills within data science. Lets see how this is reflected in the 2021 Kaggle Survey!\n\nThe country response was taken from the survey question “In which country do you currently reside?”. Where the respondents were given a list of countries to select from. However, not all countries in the world were listed here, therefore some answered with “Other”, and some respondents did not provide a response. Therefore, we referred to these respondents as Citizens of The Universe! And excluded them from our analysis. \nEach country was then matched to a continent. With countries that have areas which fall into two continents, such as Russia. To avoid overcounting we made the decision to allocate the country to the continent where the majority of the country’s landmass lied. As we did not have further details into the area of the country the respondents report to be in. \n\nThe Sankey Diagram below shows the total number of respondents of the Kaggle Survey per continent and country! There are 6 Continents represented within the diagram: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. The Sankey Diagram shows the total number of respondents in each continent and country. Fascinating! The plot is interactive, like all in our analysis. This means that if you hover your mouse over different sections of this diagram more information is revealed. Please hover over and play about to find out further details of the countries!\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create Sankey Diagram showing total repondents in each continent\n\n# Step 1 - Create Sankey data\nsankeydata = country_data[['Country', 'Continent', 'Total_Respondents']]\n\n# Step 2 -  Create continent code and colour lookup\ncontintent_list = ['Africa','Asia','Europe','North America','Oceania','South America']\ncontinent_color_list = ['coral','lightpink','paleturquoise','palegoldenrod','mediumpurple', 'aquamarine']\ncontinent_code_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\ncolor_lookup = {'Continent':contintent_list,'Link_Color':continent_color_list, 'Continent_Code': continent_code_list}\ncolor_lookup = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(color_lookup)\nsankeydata = pd.merge(sankeydata, color_lookup, on = \"Continent\", how = \"inner\")\n\n\n# Step 3 - Sort\nsankeydata = sankeydata.sort_values(by='Continent_Code', ascending = True)\n \n# Step 4 - Create country code\nsankeydata['Country_Code'] = range(6, 70)\n\n# Step 5 - Create country code\nsankeydata.sort_values(['Country','Total_Respondents'],ascending=False).groupby('Continent').head(3)\n\n#  Step 6 - Create Link lists\nlink_country_list = sankeydata['Continent_Code'].values.tolist()\nlink_continent_list = sankeydata['Country_Code'].values.tolist()\nlink_total_respondents = sankeydata['Total_Respondents'].values.tolist()\nlink_color = sankeydata['Link_Color'].values.tolist()\n\n#  Step 7 - Create node lists \ncountry_list = sankeydata['Country'].values.tolist()\nnode_area_list = contintent_list\nfor i in country_list:\n     node_area_list.append(i)\n\n#  Step 8 - Create node colour list\nnode_color_list = ['coral','lightpink','paleturquoise','palegoldenrod','mediumpurple', 'aquamarine', 'palevioletred', 'chocolate','moccasin', 'snow','forestgreen','indianred','mediumturquoise','brown','mintcream','oldlace','paleturquoise','crimson','coral','orange', 'lightsalmon','floralwhite','lavenderblush','limegreen','palegreen','hotpink','purple','blue','peachpuff','midnightblue','darkmagenta','lightyellow','salmon','tan','lightslategray','slategrey','rosybrown','cornflowerblue', 'mediumorchid', 'lemonchiffon', 'violet', 'chartreuse','green','powderblue', 'darkblue','darkorchid','thistle','dodgerblue','antiquewhite','mediumslateblue', 'darkred','lightblue','darkgoldenrod', 'seagreen', 'darkkhaki', 'mediumvioletred', 'darkcyan', 'lightsteelblue', 'wheat', 'greenyellow', 'darkseagreen', 'beige', 'indigo', 'honeydew', 'darkgrey', 'lavender', 'lightgray', 'deeppink', 'mediumblue', 'azure']\nnode = {'Country':node_area_list,'Node_Color':node_color_list}\n\n#  Step 9 - Create node df\nnode = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(node)\nnode['Node_Code'] = range(0, 70)\n\n\n#  Step 10 - Create Plot \nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(\n    node = dict(\n      pad = 15,\n      thickness = 20,\n      line = dict(color = \"black\", width = 0.5),\n      label =  node['Country'].dropna(axis=0, how='any'),\n      color = node_color_list\n\n    ),\n    link = dict(\n      source = link_country_list, # indices correspond to labels, eg A1, A2, A1, B1, ...\n      target = link_continent_list,\n      value = link_total_respondents,\n      color = link_color))])\n\nfig.update_layout(title_text=\"Sankey Diagram Showing Total Repondents from Each Continent\", font_size=10, height =1000)\n\n#  Step 11 - Show Plot \nfig.show()\n\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"papermill":{"duration":0.199775,"end_time":"2021-11-15T20:16:40.574639","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-15T20:16:40.374864","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T17:14:01.361592Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T17:14:01.362075Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T17:14:01.50826Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T17:14:01.362035Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T17:14:01.507477Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The gold medal in this award goes to India with over 7400 respondents! \n\nWe can see from the diagram above that Africa has 10 countries within the dataset.
