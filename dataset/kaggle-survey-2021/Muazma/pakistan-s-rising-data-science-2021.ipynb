Pakistan is one of the top 10 countries for the total number of respondents, and participation increased from 2019 to 2021 (Moved from number 19 to number 10). The data provides vital insights into what the Data Science Community around the world is using, what they prefer, and the population's demographics.\n\n# Objective\nUnderstand and provide a comprehensive view of the state of Data Science and Machine Learning in Pakistan. What are the key areas of interest right now, and what is the progress?\n\n# Why Pakistan\n* Pakistan's population of 220M+ people, makes it the 5th largest country, slightly ahead of Brazil. It's an incredibly young population; 115M people are under the age of 25. [1]\n* With 25,000 IT/Engg Students graduating each year, Pakistan's Tech Industry is booming. Software Engineers, Data Scientists, ML/AI Engineers, and mostly the Students are very enthusiastic.\n* Pakistani IT Industry and Startups are on the rise, with 65% growth in 2021. [3] It's been a breakout year, funding this year has outstripped the last six combined [4]\n* Pakistan ranks 6th among the fastest-growing countries of open source projects by the GitHub Report 2020 [2] with 51.5% growth in contributors since last year.\n* I was born and raised in Pakistan and spend a lot of time sharing knowledge about Data Science/ Data Engineering and ML/AI with various community efforts. I also did this [analysis in 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/muazmaz/pakistan-s-rising-data-science-community) and have wanted to see the growth since then.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Key Findings\n* Most of the respondents are Male and Students and/or Early Career.\n* Bachelors degree is more common than any other education level.\n* Google Cloud Platform is popular than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n* Most of the DS community works in small companies [<50 employees].\n* Python is the preferred programming language of choice.\n* Kaggle and YouTube are the favorite media sources. Coursera and University Courses is largest learning resource.\n* Majority of the DS community is pretty young <1 year and 1-3 years old.\n* Most of the Users do not use ML methods in production, they
