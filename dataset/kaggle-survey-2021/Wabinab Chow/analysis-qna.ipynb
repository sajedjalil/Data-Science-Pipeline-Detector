Q5 have a difference: \n\nMost people using SQL are found to be Student, Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Software Engineer. These aren't exceeding expectations. Example, even Data Engineer although low, aren't exceeding expectations because the total number of Data Engineers taking the query aren't many (466 of 668 uses SQL). What exceeds expectations is **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)**.\n\nIt seems that MLE aren't very popular using SQL (491 of 1499) hence can deduce they're perhaps more targeting on the models development. \n\nFew months ago, Data Centric development had been introduced by Andrew Ng (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo&ab_channel=DeepLearningAI) (from ones' perspective, because that's how one got introduced to data centric, but it doesn't mean he might be the first to do data centric, it might be someone else or his team or another team or whatever, one didnt research on that). Perhaps it's time to start learning SQL and be prepared. Even though we could play around based on small subset of data, when we want to apply it to real world, in a pipeline, whatever an MLE played with needs to integrate to such pipeline, without much delay. SQL provides very quick way to work through data and it's important to translate whatever query one uses into SQL. \n\nFor example, if one plays with Pandas DataFrame and uses it's SQL-like commands, they're not the fastest way to deal with data cleaning (especially since Pandas itself runs on a single core only, while others like Spark DataFrame runs on all cores, and others like CUDF or BlazingSQL runs on GPU/CUDA for preprocessing). \n\nThey're important.
