With so many different fields, job titles, and job descriptions out there, it's no wonder people change jobs an average of 12.4 times within their lifetime (source: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/nlsoy.pdf)). Luckily, for those of you reading this notebook, you've likely narrowed your selection of career choices to those in data science... but that still leaves a wide array of careers to choose from! Based on this, the aim of this notebook is to highlight differences in career paths in data science, using the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey results as the primary data source. The set-up of this notebook is as follows:\n\n- <span style=\"font-family:courier;color:green;\">*Defining the Career Paths*:</span> 6 different career groups are defined. The idea is the reader chooses one of these career groups to learn more about, to better understand what is required to pursue any of the careers within their chosen career group\n- <span style=\"font-family:courier;color:green;\">*Quick Comparison*:</span> If the reader is unsure which career group to choose, this section gives a quick comparison to help them decide (this is the last chance to choose a career group!)\n- <span style=\"font-family:courier;color:green;\"> *Career Group Deep Dive*: </span> At this point, the reader has chosen a career group. This section provides more visuals and insight specific to the reader's chosen career group\n\nThe motivation for this notebook is to help students and unemployed individuals understand the skillset they need to get their foot in the door of a particular career path and to help individuals currently in a data science role understand the skillset they need to change their job role to another role within the data science field.\n\nThis notebook includes explanations for each of the visuals to ensure the reader is correctly interpreting the visuals. These explanations are in <span style=\"font-family:courier;color:green;\"> green text </span>, so if you feel you understand a visual, you can skip over these segments. I hope this notebook inspires you and excites you about pursuing a career in data science! 😎 Comments and feedback are always welcome\n\n# Defining the Career Paths\nQuestion 5 of the survey asks users the job title most similar to their current role and gives 15 options to choose from, with one of those options being \"Other\", if none of the job titles match the user's current role. Job titles can be pretty specific and, chances are, the required skillset for some of these roles are similar. Based on this, we can group some of these job titles together to create different career path groups, then we can look at each career path group in detail. This allows you, the reader, to understand which skills may be beneficial to develop to pursue a career in a particular group, without narrowing your skill development scope to a specific job title. \n\nA [blog post by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2018/01/4-types-data-science-jobs.html) did a great job of highlighting the different skills required for different roles within data science. Anecdotally, using my experience from a data analyst position I held at an AI education research institute, I added onto the Udactiy model to illustrate the different skills used in different data science positions:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})\n\n# create dataframe with skill importance for different job categories\nskills_df= pd.DataFrame({'Data Scientist': [3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2], 'Data Analyst': [3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1], 'Data Modeller': [3,2,2,2,3,1,3,1], 'Software engineer':[3,1,2,1,2,2,3,1], 'Manager': [2,3,3,2,1,1,1,1]}, \n                           columns= ['Data Scientist','Data Analyst','Data Modeller', 'Software engineer', 'Manager'], index= ['Programming tools','Data visualization & communication','Data intuition','Statistics', 'Data wrangling','Machine learning','Software engineering','Multivariate calculus & linear algebra'])\n\nfig, ax= plt.subplots(figsize= (12,5))\nsns.heatmap(skills_df, cmap= ['indianred','gold','mediumseagreen'], linecolor= 'black', linewidth= 1, cbar= False, square= False)\nax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('top')\nplt.figtext(0.92,0.85,'Red', color= 'indianred', fontsize= 16)\nplt.figtext(0.96, 0.85, 'indicates low importance', fontsize= 14)\nplt.figtext(0.92, 0.8, 'Green', color= 'mediumseagreen', fontsize= 16)\nplt.figtext(0.99, 0.8, 'indicates high importance', fontsize= 14)\nplt.figtext(0.92, 0.75, 'Yellow', color= 'gold', fontsize= 16)\nplt.figtext(0.99, 0.75, 'is somewhere in between', fontsize= 14)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-24T16:23:05.433519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-24T16:23:05.433924Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-24T16:23:08.161585Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-24T16:23:05.433816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-24T16:23:08.160669Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"font-family:courier;color:green;\">Just to make sure you understand this figure, let's look at the Data Scientist job grouping.

For example, for the Data Modeller career group that includes Data Engineers and DBA/Database Engineers, they have similar programming experience (0.185 and 0.199 respectively). </span>\n\nIn addition to seeing that the mapping from job title to career group is acceptable, from this chart, we can get an idea of the career group with the lowest barrier to entry, based on number of years of programming experience. So, for those of you with no idea what career group you want to pursue, you can choose a career group based on the number of years of programming experience individuals in these groups have. For example, based on this mapping, an average 23 year-old student will have 2.48 years of experience programming (23 years old x 0.108 years of experience per year of a person's life), an average 23 year-old in the data analyst career group will have 2.62 years of experience programming, and an average 23 year-old in the software engineer career group will have 5.06 years of experience programming. Therefore, based on years of programming experience alone, the 23 year-old student is closer to becoming a data analyst than a software engineer. Using this approach, a person with no idea which career group they want to pursue could decide based on their years of programming experience alone.\n\nThis method of choosing a career group to pursue is all well and good, but there are more factors than just experience and hard skills that people consider when choosing a career. So, before we jump into our career group portfolios, let's do a different quick comparison between the groups to help any of you that are still uncertain.\n\n# Quick Comparison\nAccording to a [survey](https://blog.edx.org/edx-survey-finds-1-3-americans-ages-25-44-completely-changed-fields-since-starting-first-job-post-college) conducted by EdX, 39% of working Americans seek a career change for an increase in salary. So, for each of our career groups, let's look at their average yearly compensation, and highest level of education achieved. This will give us an idea of the career path with the lowest barrier to entry when it comes to education and approximately how much we could expect to make if we were to pursue such a career path.

We can also interpret that, individuals with a higher education level tend to make more than other individuals within their career group. For example, looking at the Master's degree, Bachelor's degree, and Doctoral degree nested rectangles within the Data Scientist section, the coloring of the rectangles indicate the mean yearly salary is lowest for those with a Bachelor's degree and greatest for those with a Doctoral degree. This observation applies to all other career groups except for the Other group - considering we don't know all the specific roles within this group and that it has an element of uncertainty, it is not surprising it has more variability and deviation from what we would expect. </span>\n\nBefore we jump into individual career profiles, let's summarize everything we've seen so far, so that anyone still unsure of which career group to further investigate can decide now:\n\n- The order of the career groups from lowest to highest mean normalized number of years of programming experience is as follows: Data Analyst, Other, Manager, Data Modeller, Data Scientist, and Software engineer\n- In all career groups, most individuals have at least a Bachelor's degree. For all career groups except for Software engineer, most individuals have a Master's degree. So, if you're serious about pursuing a career in data science, you might want to consider getting serious about pursuing higher education\n    - If you need motivation to pursue further education, for most career groups, individuals with a higher education tend to have a greater yearly compensation relative to others in their career group\n- The order of the career groups from lowest to highest mean yearly compensation is as follows: Data Analyst, Software engineer, Data Modeller, Data Scientist, Other, and Manager. The career group-education level combination that has the highest mean yearly compensation are Software engineers with a Doctoral degree\n\n# Career Group Deep Dive\n## Data Scientist (& How to interpret the other career group subsections)\nNow, using everything you've read so far in this notebook, choose a career group!

Summary of All Career Groups\n\nHopefully at this point you've read through the section on your career group and have an idea of what you can expect should you pursue a career in this group. Across all the career groups, there are some commonalities that are highlighted here:\n\n- There's a greater proportion of men than women + other genders combined - over 70% of survey respondents in each career group are men\n- Python and SQL are the two languages regularly used by the most people within each career group \n- Jupyter Notebook was the IDE used by the most people within each career group\n- Each career group regularly uses a mix of business intelligence and big data software - there is not one career group that regularly uses only big data products (e.g. MySQL) or only business intelligence products (e.g. Microsoft Power BI)\n- The industries with the largest data science teams are Insurance/Risk Assessment and Accounting/Finance - for all career groups, these two industries were within the top 5 industries with the largest data science teams\n    - Industries with larger data science teams also tended to have larger company sizes (i.e. data science team size is proportional to company size)\n- The top data science course resources used by individuals the career groups were Coursera, Kaggle Learn Courses, and Udemy, suggesting that these resources offer a variety of resources that can enable you to develop a diverse skillset\n\nI hope this notebook was inspiring and informative and will help you jump start the career of your dreams in data science! Comments and feedback are always welcome and good luck in your data science career 😎","metadata":{}}]}
