Gender distribution is simple to answer, about 79%(approx) of memebers are man, followed by females around 19%(approx) rest 2 percent are the other genders\n2. **1/4 of users are from india**, india holds the greatest number of kaggle users followed by USA, China, Japan, Brazil, Russia respectively.(look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n3. **1/4 of users are students only**, then data scientists and software engineers are the top 3's, these 3 covers about half of the kaggle user community.\n    - **Removed Students and Currently not employed** data to get a more precise view of Professional roles. (look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n    - Maybe the **\"Other\"** segment of pie chart belongs to the people who are from **non-IT field**, as Majority of IT roles who could be into Data Science are already present with their names.(look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n    - Even the **\"Other\"** segment of roles dominates the roles like **Analysts, ML Engineers and Researchers which should be more likely to be present at top 5s**.\n    - Maybe people who are **non-IT's uses kaggle to develop their Data Science Skills**.(look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n4. Half of the world kaggle user experience are from 0-3 year, (look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n    - **India follows the same trend as the World experience**, again the count of users.\n    - **Comparision of 10 countries to confirm**, if there is any pattern in experience. but haven't found anything(look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n5. **Python, Sql, C++, R and Java are the top 5's respectively**, are the most used language on the daily basis.\n    - Comparision done with the roles, but there is nothing much to notice, as the plots are already known and obvious, for e.g. ML engineers uses Python, SQL, R the most while Statistician uses R, then Python, and SQL. Software engineers uses python, java, javascript, C and C++.\n    - Comparision with experience is not that important, as people who uses C a decade ago are now prefering C++ or Java or Python(hypothetically) for their work as these languages offers more opportunities and people of greater experience uses a wide variety of languages over lesser experience peoples.\n6. **Python, SQL and R are the top 3's respectively**, surprisingly **C and C++ made it to top 5's**, maybe the people who voted C and C++ believes the **importance of the basic concept of programming languages first** would be more important, then pursuing Data Science directly.(look for pie chart for more detailed view)\n     - Comparision with experience, is very much identical to the world average, nothing special to note.\n     - Almost all subplots supports for  Python as 1st, SQL as 2nd and R as 3rd.\n     - Students, ML Engineers and Research Scientists voted for C, C++ and SQL approximetly equal.\n     - Product Managers prefer Julia as 4th and Java as 5th.\n     - Statistician prefers julia and C++ for 4th and 5th.\n     - developer relation/advaocacy are very different python as 1st ,SQL ties with Javascript for position 2nd, while another tie for R and Java for 4th.\n7. ---\n8. ---\n9. ---\n\n\n-- more detailed answers to be added, and I'll try to make this summary more refined.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing general libraries for EDA","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%config Completer.use_jedi = False\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.335217Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.336005Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.353155Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.335969Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.352301Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"reading the data and storing the length of dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-survey-2021/kaggle_survey_2021_responses.csv\",low_memory=False,skiprows = [1])\ndfl = len(df)\ndf.head(4)","metadata":{"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.354489Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.354918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-26T05:27:17.680431Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-26T05:27:16.354869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-26T05:27:17.679477Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"the first thing I noticed is the gender column so let's find some insights about the gender column","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Gender Distribution of Kagglers","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"the data distribution for gender is skewed so maybe log scale would be good with a count","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(20,8))\nfig.suptitle(\"Gender Distribution\")\n\nax1 = sns.countplot(x=df['Q2'], data=df,ax=ax1)\nax1.set_xticklabels(ax1.get_xticklabels(), rotation=10, ha=\"right\",fontsize= 14)\n\nax1.set_xlabel(\"Gender Distribution of Kagglers\",fontsize = 22)\nax1.set_yscale(\"log\")\n\nfor p in ax1.patches:\n    ax1.annotate('{}'.format(p.get_height()), (p.get_x()+0.2, p.get_height()+20),fontsize=16)\n    \n    \nax2 = sns.countplot(x=df['Q2'],ax=ax2,hue=df['Q3']=='India')\nax2.set_xticklabels(ax2.get_xticklabels(), rotation=10, ha=\"center\",fontsize= 14)\n\nax2.set_xlabel(\"Gender Distribution World vs Indian Kagglers\",fontsize = 22)\nax2.set_yscale(\"linear\")\n\nfor p in ax2.patches:\n    ax2.annotate('{}'.format(p.get_height()), (p.get_x(), p.get_height()+20),fontsize=14)\n\nax2.legend(labels=[\"Rest World\",\"India only\"])\n\nplt.plot()\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-26T05:27:17.682898Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-26T05:27:17.683231Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-26T05:27:18.771434Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-26T05:27:17.683188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-26T05:27:18.770797Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A great quantity of Indian users is present. let's look at the overview of World kaggle user\n# Kaggle Users Count India vs World ","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# count \nindia_count = df['Q3'].value_counts()\nindia_count = india_count[\"India\"]\nallworld = df['Q3'].value_counts().sum() -
