Executive Summary & Introduction\n\n**What is Correlation?** Based on Wikipedia, any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. In this analysis, we will be using it to measure how closely related are two different data points. E.g. Happiness Score of the all the countries and the average salary level of each. \n\nAnd according to a research paper published by Princeton University **\"high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness\"**. On the contrary, a study done at the Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania said that **money does influence happiness and, contrary to previous influential research on the subject suggesting that this plateaus above $75,000**. \n\nWe will also take a look at whether certain aspects of a country affects or influences the average salary level which in turn affects the happiness score of the country. How diverse were the respondents who took part in the survey based on the demographics. As well as other metrics that were included in the survey. e.g. education, coding experience, country of origin, gender, etc.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n1. We found out that the correlation between the happiness score of a country and the average salary of the respondents (with their respective country) were only **0.58**, which is not statistically significant enough to make a solid conclusion.\n2. Although **79.3%** of the respondents were **Male**, the average salary of those included in the **Nonbinary** gender were the highest at **62002.59**.\n3. The GDP score and salary level of each country, only has a correlation of **0.39** which is fairly low.\n4. The Product Managers have the highest average salary among all respondents at **72091.25**.\n5. And Switzerland has the highest average salary of **96974.99**, second highest happiness score and 3rd highest GDP among others.\n\n**Methodologies**\n\n1. We will be using **Python** for every metrics and computations used in this kernel.\n2. The currency which was used in the survey is the **US Dollar**.\n3. **Pearson's r** or simply Pearson correlation coefficient which was developed by **Karl Pearson** is used to measure the correlation of certain sets of numbers in this study.\n4. We've made changes on column **Q25** in order to get the numerical values instead of a string value, refer to **get_average_from_str()**. Then we calculated the ***median*** of values like **25,000-29,999** in order to get a single value.  After that, we calculated the average or the ***mean*** of the salary column based on what we are searching for. e.g. country, gender, roles\n5. We've also read 2 contrasting research papers from 2 different sources **(links in the resources)** in order not to generate any bias for this study.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"data-overview\"></a>\n# 2.

Conclusion\n\n- At **0.58** correlation, we can say that its not yet at a level where we can conclusively say that salary affects the happiness of a person. **Happiness differs from person-to-person**, there may be an outside influence that is affecting a person causing him/her not to be happy despite having a high amount of salary. \n- The country of residence of the participants are very diverse, but majority of the respondents came from **India**.\n- Although **Males** still has the majority count, its the **Nonbinary** group that has the highest average salary among all.\n- **Switzerland** has the highest average salary, second highest happiness score and 3rd highest GDP among others.\n- The GDP per Capita has a **low correlation** with the average salary. so moving to countries that has high GDP per Capital to increase your salary is not a guarantee.\n- Having a high degree of education helps in the Data Science Field.\n\nAnd before you finish reading this kernel, please answer this question:\n\n<center style=\"font-size:30px;\">Are you happy with your experience in Data Science?</center>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"resources\"></a>\n# 10.
