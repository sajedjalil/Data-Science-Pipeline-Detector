We do this by identifying/finding predefined biased words and using machine learning model in the job description. \n\n\nWe used multiple techniques for identifying language that is biased. Each technique gave us interesting and different kinds of results. This notebook has the main section for each technique and its results.\n\nHere are the short contents:\n* **Identify biases by pre-defined word**\n* **Identify biases by machine learning model**\n\n\nWe will use structured versions of job bulletins created in part 2 of our solutions. We will import that data in this notebook by directly. Because in Kaggle you can add kernel output as a dataset. We will use that feature.

We can find a good list of male and female-coded words there. Like ```defend``` is masculine coded and ```commit``` is feminine-coded. The words come from a very good **research paper written by Danielle Gaucher, Justin Friesen, and Aaron C.

It can easily turn into a good machine learning model that can identify biases more accurately.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    • <b>Gather more gender and ethnicity data:</b> The data we are using in our machine learning model is very small. It contains only 150+ jobs ethnicity and gender data. The City of LA can easily gather new data on this topic and improve model performance. If the model gets more data to train, the model could identify deep language biases and that will exlusively for City of LA job descriptions, because the model is trained using City of LA jobs data. <br/>\n<p/>\n</div>\n\n\nIn the next part the solutions, we will make EDA on the structured CSV and try to find some interesting insights.
