After having taken a look, there are some immediate thoughts/suggestions/lines of inquiry that may be worth pursuing:\n\n1. The typical job posting's length and diction feel like a barrier to entry.\n\nSome off-the-cuff recommendations:\n\n1. *Show information that is relevant and actionable to applicants to reduce friction.* For example, for relevant mutually exclusive information, there could be two modes: (1) promotional applicants (within City of LA); (2) non-City of LA prospecitve applicants. Also, perhaps have a collapsed \"FAQ\" portion to the job listing in lieu of the potentially opaque \"Notes\" listed underneath headings. If there are liability concerns, the original text can perhaps be indicated as a page prior to application submission. But for many, it is not critical to know that, for example, the examination is based on a validation study. Such information would likely be ignored, or make one wonder what is meant by \"validation study\", or else simply add to the length of the job listing (increasing the likelihood of applicants either skimming the listing or forgoing the application process altogether).\n\nAfter further analysis, I aim to show whether and with what effect size post diction and (especially) length, among other factors, change application rates across different groups."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initial Plan\n\nThe City of Los Angeles (LA) is interested in greater diversity.

Weighting each job listing by number of applicants gives similar-magnitude weights to the features but is probably overconfident in its estimates.\n\nI am hesitant to make conclusions based on this analysis, based on a warning made when seeing how well we could predict the number of applications by the previously mentioned features. There is likely collinearity issues with the chosen features (hence a \"high condition number\") or some other issue in the specification, leading to questionable estimates. We've attempted different data curation (dropping observations with missing values), investigating correlations between variables, trying different regression variables (dropping different variables off the regression), but no luck.\n\nGiven more time, it would be worth investigating the cause of the high condition number before making any conclusions. Despite this issue, it would also be worth seeing how different clusters of job postings (clustered via, for example, topic) differ from one another in required previous experience, education requirements, salary, etc.\n\nI look forward to seeing what other Kagglers have been able to pull off with this data!
