50% of the job ads are above 733 words (median) in length\n* The bi-grams like 'meet minimum requirements' , 'minimum qualifications met' are a bit formal, and appearing in the most frequent n-gram list. \n* There are excellent inclusive n-grams occuring in the most frequent list, ex: 'equal employment opportunity', 'disability accommodation form','american disabilities act'\n* There is presence of n-grams like 'marital status sexual orientation'\n* Complex qualification criteria , ex: 'Only applicants that are currently or have previously worked in the Department of Water and Power in DDR Numbers 93-39121, 93-39137, 93-39120, 93-39135, 93-39119, 93-39138, 93-39010, 93-39126, 93-39002, 93-39023, 93-39026, 42-39301, or 93-39130, and meet the above noted requirement qualify to take this examination.'\n* Some overly challenging statements, negative tone, ex: 'Applicants who fail to complete the Qualifications Questionnaire', 'Candidates in the examination process may file protests as provided in Sec.''This is an extremely competitive examination and a sufficient number of candidates with the highest scores will continue in the selection process.'\n* Dept name included in Job Title, ex: AIRPORT CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER\n\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n* Make the job bulletins more compact (max 250 words) to improve readability, attract talents\n* Make the job bulletins less formal with a inviting tone, instead of heavy emphasis on minimum requirements\n* Add inclusive policy on sexual orientation, marital status, religion\n* Simplify the qualification criteria, OR have a expert panel judge a candidate based on basic qualifications\n* Remove negative tone, like 'Applicants who fail to complete.. will not be considered' to 'Applications who complete..will be taken to next round'. Remove words like 'Protests are allowed'.\n* Optional : Simplify the Job Title, by having Dept name as a separate field, ex: Dept : Airport Title : CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER\n\n**DATA DICTIONARY**\n* \"FILE_NAME\" = File name\n* \"JOB_CLASS_TITLE\" = Job title \n* \"PREV_POSITION\" = Previous position from which promotion can be given to this job title, separated by ; in case of multiple\n* \"JOB_CLASS_NO\"= id number of the position\n* \"JOB_DUTIES\"=duties\n* \"EDUCATION_YEARS\" = Education years\n* \"SCHOOL_TYPE\" =College or University\n* \"EDUCATION_MAJOR\"=education major\n* \"COURSE_LENGTH\" =course length\n* \"IMP_ENTITIES_QUAL\"=Important ORG (Organization) entities in qualification\n* \"IMP_FAC_QUAL\"= Important FACILITY entities in qualification\n* \"IMP_PER_QUAL\"= Important PERSON entities in qualification\n* \"LEGAL_TERMS\"=Important legal terms in qualifications\n* \"MISC_COURSE_DETAILS\"= Important numbers in Qualification\n* \"EXPERIENCE_LENGTH\"=experience Yrs needed\n* \"EXP_FULL_TIME_PART_TIME\" =fullTime or PartTime experience needed\n* \"DRIVERS_LICENSE_REQ\" = R/P \n* \"DRIV_LIC_TYPE\"=DL State\n* \"OPEN_DATE\" = open Date of job application\n* \"ENTRY_SALARY_GEN\" = salary Range\n* \"EXAM_TYPE\"=Exam open to All etc"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
