As an organization, they are in a unique hiring situation. One-third of their workers are retiring very soon and they have opened a number of job roles. The organization wants to improve the job bulletins that will fill all the open positions. Most of this data is present in unstructured form and it needs to be converted into a structured format before it can be analysed and obtain actionable insights. The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can strongly influence the quality of the applicants. Also, within such a huge organization, it also becomes difficult to clearly identify which promotions are available.</p>\n\n<p style='text-align:justify'><b>Key Objectives:</b> Keeping these challenges in mind, an ideal solution for the City of Los Angeles has following key objectives: Develop an nlp framework to accurately structurize the job descriptions. Develop an analysis framework to identify the implict bias in the text and encourage diversity. Develop a system which can clearly identify the promotion pathways within the organization.</p>\n\n<b>My Submission:</b> Following are parts of Kernels Submissions in order:<br><br>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/1-description-structuring-engine-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1: Job Bulletin Structuring Engine - City of Los Angeles </a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/2-encourage-diversity-reduce-bias-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2: Encourage Diversity and Remove Unconsious Bias from Job Bulletins - A Deep Analysis</a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/3-impact-of-ctl-content-tone-language-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3: Impact of Content, Tone, and Language : CTL Analysis for CoLA</a>  </li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/4-promotional-pathway-discoverability-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4: Increasing the Discoverability of Promotional Pathways (Explicit) </a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/5-implicit-promotional-pathways-discoverability/\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5: Implicit Promotional Pathways Discoverability</a></li></ul>\n\n<br>\n<p style='text-align:justify'>In the first kernel, a complete job bulletin entity extraction and data structuring engine is developed.

Approach Overview</font> \n\n<p style='text-align:justify'>In this challenge, a corpus text files is shared in which every file is a job bulletin of a job role. The task is to parse the text files, extract different entities, pieces of information and produce a well-defined structured file. This task is a typical example of a text parsing problem in which the end goal is to simplify the text data into meaningful entities.</p> \n\n<p style='text-align:justify'>I have developed a python based engine called Job Bulletin Structuring Engine which takes input as a corpus of text files and generates a structured file as the output. The overall architecture diagram is described below: </p>  \n<div align='center'><img src='https://i.imgur.com/oZ9csXm.png' width=\"550\"></div>\n<br>\nThis architcuture has three main classes - A. Bulletin Parsing Class, B. Formatter Class, and the C. Extractor Class. \n\nThe first class is the Bulletin Parsing Class is the core class which is used to extract different entities and different fields, It uses different techniques of text mining and information reterival to obtain the entities. \n\n- Layout based Pattern Identification   \n- Keyword based Patterns Identification      \n- Regular Expressions Matching    \n\nUsing these techniques, I have developed systematic and hierarichial parsing rules tailored for specific entity and general entities. Entities here mean different fields/information to be extracted from text files. The process of developing these nlp / text mining based rules was very iterative. I randomly read and explored more than 50 text files and observed the key patterns in them. Develop the parsing rule, test it, validate it, identify failure cases and iterated again. \n\nThe second class is the Formatter class in which results of different entities are passed as input, they are standardized, cleaned, formatted to desired format, and validated. The results are then stored in a csv file which is given as the output. Finally, The third class is the Extractor class which is used to execute the overall parsing and cleaning processes based on user inputs.   \n\n**Key features:**\n- Reusable and Generic Functions: The engine consists of code snippets which are generic codes for many fileds.   \n- Cleaning Functions : In many cases, extracted entities contain noise, hence many custom functions to clean the results are added.    \n- Code and Documentation : The comprehensive documentation of both the codes and the text parsing rules is also shared.   \n- Edge Case Handelling: Since this is a very unstructured problem, there were many edge cases in text parsing, I have incorporated as many as such cases possible to give best possible results.   \n\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2. Complete Code Implementation</font> (<a href='http://www.shivambansal.com/blog/network/cola/BulletinStructuringEngine.html'>DOCUMENTATION</a>)\n\nThe next section contains the entire well-documentated source code which follows pep8 guidelines and uses best coding practices. In the section <a href=\"#5\">5</a>, I have also shared a python package which can be used to produce the results with 2 lines of code.\n\nPackage link: https://pypi.org/project/pycola/\n\n<div id=\"2.1\"></div>\n### <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2.1 BulletinParser Class</font>\n\nThe first component is BulletinParser Class whose role is to obtain entities and information using different text mining rules.

Python Package</font>\n\nFor reusability, reproducibility and ease, I have wrapped the entire code in a python package callend \"pycola\". This package makes my solution fully automated and can be accessed anywhere. Following are the instructions to use the package:  \n\n#### Installation \n\n<code>pip install pycola</code>\n\n#### Usage \n```python\nfrom pycola.bulletin_parser import Extractor\n\n## define the input path\nconfig = {\n\t\"input_path\" : \"Bulletins/\",\n\t\"output_filename\" : \"structured_file.csv\"\n}\n\n## create the Extractor Class object\nextr = Extractor(config)\n\n## call the extraction function\nextr.extraction()\n```\n\nPackage link : https://pypi.org/project/pycola/\n\n<div id=\"6\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">6. Key Highlights of the Approach </font>\n\nIn the end, I would like to highlight specific cases and elements that I have incorporated. \n\n**<font color=\"#ff3fb5\">1. Edge Cases Handelling:</font>** I have incorporated many flexible text mining rules and handled different edge cases. For example: \n\n**Requirement of Zoo Creator Job Class (4297):**  \n\n>**Line1:** 1. Graduation from an accredited four-year college or university with a major in zoology, biology, or a closely related field; and  \n>**Line2:** 2. a.  Three years of full time paid professional zoo experience as an assistant or associate curator, curator, assistant  \n>**Line3:** zoo director, or zoo director; or  \n>**Line4:** b.  Three years of full time paid experience supervising the care, selection, or identification of exotic and wild animals as a   \n>**Line5:** Senior Animal Keeper, or in a class at that level, with the City of Los Angeles.     \n\nIn this requirement, we can observe that the single line text is broken into multiple lines and creates an edge cases. I observed that many other approaches used in the competition have ignore such edge cases and results differ. I added flexible rules to identify such cases and further recity them before information extraction. Following is the rectified result:   \n\n>**Line1:** 1. Graduation from an accredited four-year college or university with a major in zoology, biology, or a closely related field; and  \n>**Line2:** 2. a.  Three years of full time paid professional zoo experience as an assistant or associate curator, curator, assistant zoo director, or zoo director; or  \n>**Line3:** b.  Three years of full time paid experience supervising the care, selection, or identification of exotic and wild animals as a Senior Animal Keeper, or in a class at that level, with the City of Los Angeles.     \n\nAtleast 10 files had such problem. While other rules are also added for cases like: \n\n- single line requirement    \n- requirements with no bullets  \n- abrupt line breaks   \n\n**<font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2. Fully Automated:</font>** \n\nThe whole system is fully automated, it just needs an input and it produces the structured results. This is how one can use the code. The users can either choose to run this kernel to get the results, or they can use the package \"pycola\" which I have created by wrapping the code of this kernel in a module. Simply, install the package using the following command. \n\n<code>pip install pycola</code>\n\nand then use it as defined in point 5. Package is hosted at pypi (https://pypi.org/project/pycola/)   \n\n\n**Generic Functions:**    \n\nSame functions were used to extract different entities just by passing different arguments. For example - \n\n> - year_month() function was used to extract corresponding years/months/semesters/quarters using different input arguments.  \n> - presence_check() function was used to check if a group of keywords is present in the text, used for different fields.       \n> - portion() function was used to extract different portions of text from the bulletins by passing different input arguments.  \n\n**<font color=\"#ff3fb5\">3. Coding Practicies:</font>**   \n\nAll the snippets in all of my kernels uses PEP8 and coding conventions from the popular The [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](\"https://docs.python-guide.org/) by Kenneth Reitz.  \n\n**<font color=\"#ff3fb5\">4. Documentation, Comments and DocStrings:</font>** \n\nFunctions, methodology, and the classes are well-documented using docstrings and useful comments. It can be viewed <a href='http://www.shivambansal.com/blog/network/city_of_la/BulletinStructuringEngine.html'>here</a>\n\n**<font color=\"#ff3fb5\">5. Solution Evaluation:</font>**  \n\n> - For evaluation purposes, I focussed on two metrics - **Completeness** and **Correctness**. \n> - **Completeness:** Ability of the framework to give as many as possible results possbile both in terms of following:      \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - completeness in terms of Files  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - completeness in terms of Columns / Fields   \n> - **Correctness:** Ability of the framework to produce as accurate as possible results    \n> - I developed this framework in a highly iterative process in which constant evaluation was part of every step.  \n\nThe iteration process was: \n\n> - Maintained a randomized sample of N files. Started small with N = 10 files only.  \n> - From the reminaing files, used M files (started small with M = 10) to develop the parts of the framework (example - writing text mining rules, expressions, and keyword dictionaries for relevant information extraction).   \n> - Manually evaluate the results for the M+N files both in terms of completeness and correctness.   \n> - In the cases in which the techniques were not giving the results, I tried to identified the root cause (different pattern, data format issue, different keywords used etc.)    \n> - Using the learnings from the evaluation, updated the techniques and rules to incorporate as much as and as correct as possible results. \n> - Iterated the process for bigger samples, N = 25, 50, and 100 and M = 50, 100, 500. \n> - In the end, I also did a manual quality check of the final structured file multiple times to make sure that system has produced the desired results. \n\n### Next Kernels: \nFor next parts of my submission (analysis and recommendations), please visit next kernels of my Submission: \n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/1-description-structuring-engine-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1: Job Bulletin Structuring Engine - City of Los Angeles </a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/2-encourage-diversity-reduce-bias-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2: Encourage Diversity and Remove Unconsious Bias from Job Bulletins - A Deep Analysis</a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/3-impact-of-ctl-content-tone-language-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3: Impact of Content, Tone, and Language : CTL Analysis for CoLA</a>  </li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/4-promotional-pathway-discoverability-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4: Increasing the Discoverability of Promotional Pathways (Explicit) </a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/5-implicit-promotional-pathways-discoverability/\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5: Implicit Promotional Pathways Discoverability</a></li></ul>\n\nNext <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/2-encourage-diversity-reduce-bias-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Kernel</a> - Analysis of Unconscious Bias in Job Bulletins."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
