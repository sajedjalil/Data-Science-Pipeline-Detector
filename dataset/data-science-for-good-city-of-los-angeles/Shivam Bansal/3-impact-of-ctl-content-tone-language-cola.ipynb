The goal of all types of analysis is to measure how well the job descriptions are written. The hypothesis is if the text is well written and fully serves its purpose, then it is likely to attract a good quality and quantity of applicants. To validate the hypothesis, I have also created a benchmark index using an indirect method, which can be used to compare CoLA insights with the market insights</p>       \n     \n### <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">Table of Contents</font>   \n\n<a href=\"#1\">1.

Key Recommendations</a>     \n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">1. Why Content, Tone, Language and Layout Matters ?</font>   \n\nA number of studies ([LinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/job-descriptions/2018/job-description-heatmap), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/03/28/need-to-attract-top-talent-try-these-12-smart-hiring-strategies/#78d24e616a69), and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/6-traits-great-job-descriptions/)) have suggested that both the quality and the quantity of applicant's pool can be significantly influenced by how a job description is written. \n\n*\"A well-written, complete, and insightful job description can result in attracting some of the top and diverse talents for the role\"*. On the other hand, a description which lacks key features (example - an optimal word limit, choice of the words, language used, overall tone) may result in attracting fewer candidates. It is important for City of Los Angeles to share the job descriptions with optimal and satisfactory content, language, tone, and the layout.     \n\nThe job descriptions are meant to effectively communicate about a particular job class, duties, responsibilities, requirements, and company to the audience. The point worth noting is that, the audience may have versatile backgrounds, demographics, different thought processes, intelligence, intellectuals, and different skills. With such diversity possible in applicants, it become important for the company to make sure that job descriptions are generic and not focussed to target a particular group. \n\n- **Content:** Content plays the most important role in describing the overall quality of a job description. Use of too many words, long paragraphs, and irrelevant verbose may not be perceived equally by all candidates, Especially women who according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified), tend to get 100% clarity about the job before applying. Another example from Linkedin study was related to length of job descriptions, Shorter job posts garnered a higher application rate than longer ones. Thus, keeping the job description text concise and optimal helps candidates immediately get the info they need. \n\n- **Tone:** For any big company it is important to express a professional tone in the job descriptions. An ideal text should be written in a formal tone and should reflect company's actual culture. The overall tone can be formal, generic or casual tones. Moreover, Use of particular wordings or phrases can also communicate emotional tones, which can have a direct impact on the applicant pool. For instance, more use of words with negative sentiment may reflect a pessimistic tone and may give a bad impression. It may result in only a fraction of potential applicants will apply. \n\n- **Language:** Choice of words and phrases is another important factor that makes up a good job description. Langauge analysis is about evaluating if the text conveys the proper message it is meant to be. One key example is about job duties which are meant to convey what the person will be doing if they are hired. It is possible that langauge or text of job duties section may not properly convey all those actions.    \n\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2. Creating A Benchmark Index for Hypothesis Validation </font>   \n\nThe problem statement of this challenge is very open ended and without actual applicant's response data, one cannot validate if all the intution and hypothesis are correct or not. Though I have used a number of other studies and researches conducted by many other companies as the reference to suggest key hypothesis but it is also important to develop a high level validation strategy. \n\n<div id=\"2.1\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2.1 Analogy of using a Market Benchmark Index </font>   \n\n> - **Analogy:** In stock markets, investors refer to [S&P 500 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index) which is an aggreagted stock index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or the Cboe BZX Exchange. Investors use this index to understand how the overall market is performing and if their stock is also aligned (or below, or above) with it. Hence, it serve as a benchmark index.     \n> - In the similar manner, I created my own benchmark index by analysing the Job Descriptions of Fortune 500 Companies ([Forbes: Fortune 500 companies](http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/)). Use of this index, gives us a \"Industry\" benchmark (similar to \"market\" in S&P 500). Ofcourse, this index may not convey an exact reflection of metrics but this index definately gives the most ideal metrics which are used by some of the top and big companies having diverse sectors.   \n> - To state an example, it will be interesting to compare what is the average number of words used in City of Los Angeles job descriptions and that of Fortune 500 companies descriptions.   \n\nThe following diagram explains how I developed this index\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V73UmtU.png)  \n \n<br>\nI obtained the list of 2019 fortune 500 companies from [Forbes](http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/). I made different input queries (location=\"la\", role=\"CityofLA Job Roles\", company=\"One of the 500 companies\") and queried them in Free Public API of Indeed to obtain the job bulletins of these 500 companies. I obtained maximum three job descriptions per company, obtained the text data, and calculated all the relevant metrics to be used as a benchmark. The script of this process is shared in the next cell. The code is commented, it requires two arguments - API_KEY (which can be obtained from this link - https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/) and a list of job roles to be searched.  \n\n*Adding this benchmark comparison gives a data-driven perspective to this problem along with our hypothesis.* "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom plotly import tools\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords \nfrom nltk.util import ngrams\nimport textstat, spacy, nltk \nimport pandas as pd, os\nimport string, re\nimport json\n\nbase_path = \"../input/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/cityofla/CityofLA/Job Bulletins/\"\next_path = \"../input/cityofla-external/\"\nstructured_path = \"../input/1-bulletin-structuring-engine-cola/structured_file.csv\"\nstructured_df = pd.read_csv(structured_path)\nstopwords = stopwords.words('english')\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n\n\n################### Code to Query Indeed API ############################\n\n\"\"\"\n:params: \n\"API_KEY\" : can be obtained from Indeed\n\"userip\" : Ip address of the user \n\"LIST_OF_JOB_ROLES\" : a file which contain job role titles to be searched\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom indeed import IndeedClient\nclient = IndeedClient('API_KEY')\nqueries = open('LIST_OF_JOB_ROLES.txt').read().split(\"\\n\")\n\nfor query in queries:\n    st, visited = 1, []\n    fout = open(query + \".txt\", \"w\")\n    for start in range(1, 5):\n        try:\n            params = {\n                'q' : query, 'l' : \"los angeles\", 'userip' : \"0.0.0.0\",\n                'useragent' : \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2)\",\n                'start' : st, 'limit' : \"25\"\n            }\n            search_response = client.search(**params)\n            for a in search_response['results']:\n                key = a['company'] + \"_\" + a['jobtitle']\n                if key not in visited:\n                    visited.append(key)\n                    a['query'] = q\n                    fout.write(json.dumps(a) + \"\\n\")\n            st = start*25\n        except Exception as E:\n            continue\n\"\"\"\npass","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The compiled file of job bulletins text of these Fortune 500 companies is shared in external dataset used in this kernel, named as \"fortune_500_jds.csv\".    \n\n<div id=\"2.2\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">2.2 Fortune 500 Companies: Job Bulletins Analysis </font>   \n\nIn the next cell, I have analysed all the relevant metrics related to this kernel for the job bulletins of fortune 500 companies.

The use of easy words should garner more responses as they must be grasped by a diverse set of people.

Analysis of Bulletins Language</font>   \n\nIn this section, we focus on analysing the language used in the job description of CoLA jobs.

The main goal of this section is to effectively communicate what does the employee of the particular job class do. This section describes all the actions or responsibilties to be performed by the employee. \n\nAny duties text which lacks this **action describing nature** is an example of **poorly written text**. A poorly written job duties section is likely to have following characteristics:\n\n- **Very few verbs:** this means that the duties section does not effectively describe what does the person will do or need to do in that job class.   \n- **High use of nouns:** this indicates that duties section talks a lot about entities or facts and less about the actions to be done.  \n\nAn example of a well written job duties section should have more usage of verbs that describe what does the person do and less usage of nouns. The main hypothesis is that the applicant should be well aware about all the possible responsibilties to be carried out in the job. The applicant should not bother about all the irrelevant or indirect details but should perceive the information about \"actions to do\". \n\nLet's look at how City of LA uses nouns and verbs in the job duties.

A job description should not be very demanding in nature or tone as it may put off some applicants. Consider the applicants which do not qualify 100% for the job but about 70-80% which is still good for the company. However, due to the demanding or strictness conveyed from the job bulletin, those candidates may not apply for such jobs. Hence in order to encourage applications which is directly linked to getting more diverse applications, it is necessary to measure and rectify strictness conveyed due to use of some words. \n\nLet's look at en example in which more number of strict words or phrases is used.

Is the format optimal ? </font>    \n\nOne of the key point I noticed that generally City's job bulletin's requirements have about 3 lines talking about job descriptions. The lines end with one of \"or\" /\"and\" which indicates that only one of the requirement set needs to be fulfilled. However, the use of \"or\" towards the very end is not immediately visible to the applicants and gives the first impression that the particular job class requires 3 different requirements. But in reality, they are only asking for 1. \n\nA simple solution for this issue is suggested in the following figure. Just by making a slight change, requirements can become more clear and explict. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E2wG9FQ.png) \n\n\n<div id=\"6\"></div>\n## <font color=\"#ff3fb5\">6. What is the overall Tone / Sentiment of CoLA Job Bulletins</font>    \n\nSimilar to strictness tone discussed in section 4.1, it is also necessary that overall sentiment of the job bulletins should not be too negative. Use of sentences and words that convey moderate or high negative sentiments should be avoided. I used python's textblob library to caluclate the sentiment of every text in each of the document. \n\nLet's look at some examples of sentence with high negative sentences which can be avoided.

Key Recommendations</font>    \n\n**Recommendation 1:** An Optimal Bulletin's Length \n> - The analysis performed in section 3 suggest that lenghts of City of LA's bulletin's is somewhat higher. It is recommended that unnecessary jargon, irrelevant details should be avoided. Bulletins should be made more crisper by cutting down atleast 30-40% of words used. On an average, City should try to use not more than 20 sentences and 700 keywords in the overall description. Additionally, as every career advisor suggest to every job candidate that their resume should be single page, similarl, for an organization, it will be really good to cut down the bulletin's to single page. This will help the candidates to grasp the information quickly. Reduce the average sentence length as well, number of words in a sentence should be as less possible. This is because the reader should get the main context of the different sections from the relevant information.  \n\n**Recommendation 2:** Easier to Read Job Bulletins \n> - Section 3 analysis also suggest that a large number of the job bulletin's consists of complex keywords. Mainly the words having more number of syllables (or sounds). It is obvious that most of the words cannot be ignored, however increased use of polysyllable (greater than three syllables) keywords reduces the readability of the overall text. Job bulletin's are meant to attract more and a variety of applicant's. To ensure that this happens, it is recommended to increase the use of more easier words and reducing the keywords having more than three sounds. \n\n**Recommendation 3:** Well Written Job Duties   \n> - The analysis performed in section 4 describes that Most of the job bulletin's duties section is not optimally written. An optimal duties section should clearly describe the actions, tasks, responsibilities of the job class. Hence, more use of verbs should be encouraged. Atleast 5 verbs that describe the actions should be used in the duties. Use of more verbs suggest that the duties section is more insightful and less factual. Hence, it makes it easier for the applicants or the readers to quickly get acquainted about the job duties. This will have a direct correlation on increase in number of applicants.    \n\n**Recommendation 4:** An Optimistic Tone of the Bulletin   \n> - Bulltein's should not sound pessimistic to the applicants. Minimize the use of keywords which gives a pessimistic or daunting tone. Instead of saying - X is must have, City can say, X is good to have. Also minimize the use of negative keywords such as - disqualified, fail etc. Instead use words which may convey the same message but in a much polite tone.     \n\n**Recommendation 5:** Less Cluttered Requirements Section    \n> - Make the requirement section more visible and less cluttered. Since, there is the use of logical operators (and, or) in the requirement pointers, hence it is recommended to remove the numbers (1, 2, 3) because their are only single independent sets not multiple sets. This is to ensure the applicant's to get the clear message in the first impression. Research suggested that female genders dont apply untill they feel that they meet 100% of the requirements. Thus, three points in the requirements should not give a wrong message.   \n\nCity of LA can use this kernel to keep track of these different metrics and compare them with a benchmark index. Keep a track on average readability score of the job bulletin, try to make the sentences as readable as possible. An ideal range of automated readability index is about 10.  \n\n### Next Kernels: \nFor next parts of my submission (analysis and recommendations), please visit next kernels of my Submission: \n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/1-description-structuring-engine-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1: Job Bulletin Structuring Engine - City of Los Angeles </a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/2-encourage-diversity-reduce-bias-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2: Encourage Diversity and Remove Unconsious Bias from Job Bulletins - A Deep Analysis</a>  </li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/3-impact-of-ctl-content-tone-language-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3: Impact of Content, Tone, and Language : CTL Analysis for CoLA</a>  </li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/4-promotional-pathway-discoverability-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4: Increasing the Discoverability of Promotional Pathways (Explicit) </a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/5-implicit-promotional-pathways-discoverability/\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5: Implicit Promotional Pathways Discoverability</a></li></ul>\n\nNext <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/4-promotional-pathway-discoverability-cola\" target=\"_blank\">Kernel</a> - Method to identify and visualize explict promotion pathways."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
