For incomes, there is 'inc_very_low', 'inc_low', 'inc_medium', 'inc_high', and 'inc_very_high'. Similarly, for education there is 'edu_very_short', 'edu_short', 'edu_medium', 'edu_high', 'edu_very_high'.

The sizes of the nodes represent the number of job bulletins with the respective income/education duration.\n\nIt turns out that the highest educational time ('edu_very_long') does not result in a high salary, indicated by the connection to the nodes \"inc_low\" and \"inc_medium\".
