The city has partnered with Kaggle to create a competition to improve the job bulletins that will fill all those open positions.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nThe content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. The Los Angeles Mayor’s Office wants to reimagine the city’s job bulletins by using text analysis to identify needed improvements.  \n\nThe goal is to convert a folder full of plain-text job postings into a structured CSV file and then to use this data to: (1) identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants; (2) improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool; and/or (3) make it easier to determine which promotions are available to employees in each job class.\n\n# How to Participate\n1. Accept the Rules\n - Accept the [competition rules][1].  \n2. Make Your Submission\n - Follow the [submission instructions][2].\n\nWIth your help, Los Angeles will overcome a wave of retirements and fill those jobs with a strong and diverse workforce. Good luck and happy Kaggling!\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/rules\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/overview/submission-instructions"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import python packages\nimport os\nfrom os import walk\nimport shutil\nfrom shutil import copytree, ignore_patterns\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom wand.image import Image as Img\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n\n# Define helper function for plotting word clouds\ndef wordCloudFunction(df,column,numWords):\n    # adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/most-common-forum-topic-words\n    topic_words = [ z.lower() for y in\n                       [ x.split() for x in df[column] if isinstance(x, str)]\n                       for z in y]\n    word_count_dict = dict(Counter(topic_words))\n    popular_words = sorted(word_count_dict, key = word_count_dict.get, reverse = True)\n    popular_words_nonstop = [w for w in popular_words if w not in stopwords.words(\"english\")]\n    word_string=str(popular_words_nonstop)\n    wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=STOPWORDS,\n                          background_color='white',\n                          max_words=numWords,\n                          width=1000,height=1000,\n                         ).generate(word_string)\n    plt.clf()\n    plt.imshow(wordcloud)\n    plt.axis('off')\n    plt.show()\n\n# Define helper function for plotting word bar graphs\ndef wordBarGraphFunction(df,column,title):\n    # adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/most-common-forum-topic-words\n    topic_words = [ z.lower() for y in\n                       [ x.split() for x in df[column] if isinstance(x, str)]\n                       for z in y]\n    word_count_dict = dict(Counter(topic_words))\n    popular_words = sorted(word_count_dict, key = word_count_dict.get, reverse = True)\n    popular_words_nonstop = [w for w in popular_words if w not in stopwords.words(\"english\")]\n    plt.barh(range(50), [word_count_dict[w] for w in reversed(popular_words_nonstop[0:50])])\n    plt.yticks([x + 0.5 for x in range(50)], reversed(popular_words_nonstop[0:50]))\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.show()\n\n# Preview the data folder\ninputFolder = '../input/cityofla/CityofLA/Additional data/PDFs'\nfor root, directories, filenames in os.walk(inputFolder):\n    for filename in filenames: \n        print(os.path.join(root,filename))\n        \n# Reorganize the data folder\noutputFolder = '/kaggle/working/pdfs/'\nshutil.copytree(inputFolder,outputFolder,ignore=ignore_patterns('*.db'))\nfor root, directories, filenames in os.walk(outputFolder, topdown=False):\n    for file in filenames:\n        try:\n            shutil.move(os.path.join(root, file), outputFolder)\n        except OSError:\n            pass\nshutil.rmtree(os.path.join(outputFolder,'2018'),\n              os.path.join(outputFolder,'2017'),\n              os.path.join(outputFolder,'2016'))\nshutil.rmtree(os.path.join(outputFolder,'2015'),\n              os.path.join(outputFolder,'2014'))\nprint(os.listdir(outputFolder))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"files = next(os.walk('/kaggle/working/pdfs/'))[2] \nprint(\"Total Number of Files in CityofLA Dataset: \", len(files))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preview a PDF file\npdf = os.path.join(outputFolder,'APPRENTICE -
