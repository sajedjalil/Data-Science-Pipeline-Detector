Are there pairs or groups of genres, which are commonly listened to by the same users? We could use this type of user-driven genre similarity as a feature in recommender systems, in particular for cold-start cases. Let's say, people who like *alternative rock* commonly also like *indie* - we can recommend *indie* songs to new users who only listened to a few *alternative rock* tracks so far.\n\nSince we only have the genre-IDs and don't know their \"physical\" meaning, we cannot use any higher-level background info (i.e. from music genre taxonomies). My idea for this kernel is to model genres in a **graph**. Each genre represents a node, associated with a node score which indicates how often this genre appears in the train set. Edges between nodes represent co-occurrences. The edge weights indicate how often a single user in the train set liked (by means of target = 1) both genres. For example, if the edge weight between alternative rock and indie has weight 500, this means that there are 500 users with at least one song with target = 1 and alternative rock as a genre tag, who also have at least one song with target = 1 and indie tag.\n\nI first construct a similarity matrix from the training data, then convert it to a **networkx** graph and use a 2-D layout to visualise genre similarities and popularities.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"import networkx as nx\nimport itertools\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # nx won't draw without this\n%matplotlib notebook ","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code"},{"outputs":[],"source":"dataPath = '../input/' # set the data path","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code"},{"outputs":[],"source":"# read songs into pandas data frame\nsongs = pd.read_csv(dataPath + 'songs.csv')\nsongs = songs[['song_id','genre_ids']] # we don't need the rest","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"There may be various genre tags per song, separated by a \"|\".
