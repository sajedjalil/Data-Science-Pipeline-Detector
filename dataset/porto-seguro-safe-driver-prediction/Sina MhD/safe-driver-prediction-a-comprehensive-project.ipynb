Can we predict if someone is going to file an insurance claim next year? It seems this problem has too much randomness in its nature and it will be hard to predict the future based on the past data. This is why the best score of the leaderboard is not far better than a random guess. However, we cannot ignore the predictive power of some features. \n\nPorto Seguro, is one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies. The problem we are going to tackle is to train a model that can predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. An accurate model  will allow the company to further tailor their prices and gain more profit and it can be benefical for safe drivers as well.\n\nIn this project, I will use Lightgbm boosting algorithm which is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.
