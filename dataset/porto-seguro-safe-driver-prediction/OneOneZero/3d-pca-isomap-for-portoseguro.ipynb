Isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. The algorithm computes the nearest neighbors for every sample and builds a neighborhood-graph. So we should also use our scaled data, since Isomap relies on distances. In order to derive the lower-dimensional representation of the data, the algorithm calculates the shortest path between every pair of nodes in the neighborhood-graph. It then tries to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that preserves these distances as good as possible.\n\nSince Isomap is computationally heavy, we have to sample a subset of our data.
