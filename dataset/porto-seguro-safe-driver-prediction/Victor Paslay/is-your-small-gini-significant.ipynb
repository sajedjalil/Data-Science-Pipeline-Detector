Since I'm not a statistician but a software engineer I decided to use my programming skills to make Gini scoring on simulated data and answer the next very specific questions:\n- How much samples it is needed to be correct to improve Gini from *0.286* to *0.287*?\n- What is the probability to get from *0.286* to *0.287* by just random guessing?\n\nAlso I got a bit excited what I can do and played with public/private scoring. It's cool when you can simulate 0.290! :D\n\nI would like to repeat that I'm not a statistician and I do not pretend on ultimate truth. The experiment I provide may be wrong and contain some things I am missing. Any criticism, suggestions, hints are very welcomed. The more I'm writing the more I'm doubting whether it's not a trash :)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"98fb65dc-250a-4bce-9d61-cf7c2fd0bb39","_uuid":"6c594684f502727b683dc73f112f8fa7c0020014"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Assumptions\nWe assume the next things:\n- Imbalance of positive and negative classes in the test set is the same as in the training set.\n- Our model outputs uniformly distributed probabilities.\n- Public and private leaderboard scores are independent from each other.
