{"cells":[{"source":"# Introduction","metadata":{"cell_style":"center"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Often while working on a machine learning problem we come across situations where our model is working well on our validation data but it performs poorly on the test data. One of the possible reasons can be that the validation set is not a true representative of the test data. That means the input features (covariates) in our test data follow a different distribution compared to our validation/training data. This situation is also called ***Covariate Shift***. Here I'm discussing a method to identify whether covariate shift exist between the 2 datasets that we are comparing. I have also stated some ideas related to how we can adjust for this shift.\n\nThis kernel is inspired by the following discussion: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43453  and the code is borrowed from the following repository: https://github.com/erlendd/covariate-shift-adaption . The method discussed here comes from refs [1-2].\n@tilli your posts are amazing!!\n\nAny improvements or possible ideas are welcome.\n\n##### References \n[1] Shimodaira, H. (2000).

It is shown in [1] that this is related to the expected training loss by a factor $\\beta = \\frac{p(X_{te})}{p(X_{train})}$, i.e.\n\n$E\\left[l(f(X_{test}), y)\\right] = E\\left[\\frac{p(X_{test})}{p(X_{train})}\\,l(f(X_{train}), y)\\right]$.\n\nWhat does this mean? First, $p(X_{test})$ being on the numerator of $\\beta$ means that points in the training data that are close to high-density regions of the test data will be weighted-up. This makes a lot of sense intuitively. Second, the $p(X_{train})$ term on the demoninator of $\\beta$ actually reduces the contribution from training points that are in a high-density region of the training data. Therefore in a region of feature-space where the training and test distributions are very similar $\\beta$ will be close to one, and in more imbalanced regions $\\beta$ should vary compensate.\n\nHow to actually use this? There are different ways to make use of this discussed in the literature. One method is using kernel means matching, to match the differing distributions. Another simpler method is by training a discriminative classifier to learn $p(X_{train}|D)$, for some data $D$.\n\nFor an example of this in action, see below!\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction\nI'm using data from this kaggle competition for exposition.\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"import matplotlib\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold as SKF\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression as LR\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score as AUC\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pylab as plt\nfrom sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, Imputer, StandardScaler\nfrom pandas.api.types import is_string_dtype, is_numeric_dtype\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import forest\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11},{"source":"## Data Loading ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"#loading test and train data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/unzippedraw/train.csv',low_memory=True)\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/unzippedraw/test.csv',low_memory=True)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12},{"outputs":[],"source":"#making copy\ntrn =  train.copy()\ntst =  test.copy()","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13},{"source":"## Data Preparation","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"#adding a column to identify whether a row comes from train or not\ntst['is_train'] = 0\ntrn['is_train'] = 1 #1 for train","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14},{"outputs":[],"source":"tst.shape,trn.shape","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15},{"source":"Test data has 892816 rows and train has 595212 rows.
