Plot.ly is one of the main products offered by the software comapny - Plotly which specialized in providing online graphical and statistical visualisations (charts and dashboards) as well as providing an API to a whole rich suite of programming languages and tools such as Python, R, Matlab, Node.js, etc.\n\nListed below for easy convenience are links to the various Ploly plots in this notebook. \n\n- Simple horizontal bar plot : Used to inspect the Target variable distribution\n- Correlation Heatmap plot : Inspect the correlation between the different features\n- Scatter plot : Compare the feature importances generated by Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted model\n- Vertical bar plot : List in Descending order, the importance of the various features\n- 3D Scatter plot\n\nThe themes in this notebook can be briefly summarized follows:\n\n1. Data Quality Checks : Visualising and evaluating all missing/Null values\n2. Feature inspection and filtering : Correlation and feature Mutual information plots against the target variable. Inspection of the Binary, categorical and other variables. \n3.

This is due to the fact that the missingno matrix plot can only comfortable fit in approximately 40 odd features to one plot after which some columns may be excluded, and hence the remaining 5 null columns have been excluded. To visualize all nulls, try changing the figsize argument as well as tweaking how we slice the dataframe. \n\nFor the 7 null columns that we are able to observe, they are hence listed here as follows:\n\nps_ind_05_cat | ps_reg_03 | ps_car_03_cat | ps_car_05_cat | ps_car_07_cat | ps_car_09_cat | ps_car_14\n\nMost of the missing values occur in the columns suffixed with _cat._ One should really take further note of the columns ps_reg_03, ps_car_03_cat and ps_car_05_cat.
