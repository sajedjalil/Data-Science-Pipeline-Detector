Search for the holly grail feature and check if mean score has improved by 1e-11\n4. Submit to the LB\n5. If rank is up, keep the change, if its down I'm sad and I drop the change\n6.

With this assumption statistic $t$ is assumed to follow a t distribution with 5 degrees of freedom. The proof of this is in the paper itself ;-)\n\nTo test the null hypothesis we compute the value of $t$ and check if it statisfies a t distribution with 5 degree of freedom. Namely we check if the value looks like an outlier or not. If the value stays close enough to 0 then the null hypothesis is satisfied and classifiers are asummed to be equal.\n\nThe thresholds for various t distributions are available on [this web page](http://www.medcalc.org/manual/t-distribution.php).\n\nPlease note that most of the statistical test for classifiers use the accuracy score and that I extend this to Gini without being sure the test still holds (I would have to check the distribution of score differences over several 2-fold iterations).\n\nLet's look at the code now"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f3781ee14e7b88a36ee27f91095ff07949fc3065","_cell_guid":"42a50f1b-f4bf-4296-a525-d59ebfc14b39"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"# Choose seeds for each 2-fold iterations\nseeds = [13, 51, 137, 24659, 347]\n# Initialize the score difference for the 1st fold of the 1st iteration \np_1_1 = 0.0\n# Initialize a place holder for the variance estimate\ns_sqr = 0.0\n# Initialize scores list for both classifiers\nscores_1 = []\nscores_2 = []\ndiff_scores = []\n# Iterate through 5 2-fold CV\nfor i_s, seed in enumerate(seeds):\n    # Split the dataset in 2 parts with the current seed\n    folds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=2, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\n    # Initialize score differences\n    p_i = np.zeros(2)\n    # Go through the current 2 fold\n    for i_f, (trn_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(folds.split(target, target)):\n        # Split the data\n        trn_x, trn_y = trn.iloc[trn_idx], target.iloc[trn_idx]\n        val_x, val_y = trn.iloc[val_idx], target.iloc[val_idx]\n        # Train classifiers\n        clf1.fit(trn_x, trn_y, eval_set=[(val_x, val_y)], early_stopping_rounds=20, verbose=0)\n        clf2.fit(trn_x, trn_y, eval_set=[(val_x, val_y)], early_stopping_rounds=20, verbose=0)\n        # Compute scores\n        preds_1 = clf1.predict_proba(val_x, num_iteration=clf1.best_iteration_)[:, 1]\n        score_1 = roc_auc_score(val_y, preds_1)\n        preds_2 = clf2.predict_proba(val_x, num_iteration=clf2.best_iteration_)[:, 1]\n        score_2 = roc_auc_score(val_y, preds_2)\n        # keep score history for mean and stdev calculation\n        scores_1.append(score_1)\n        scores_2.append(score_2)\n        diff_scores.append(score_1 -
