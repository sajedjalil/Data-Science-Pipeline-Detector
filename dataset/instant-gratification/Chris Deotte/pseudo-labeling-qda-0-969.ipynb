I would like to explain why it works, make a few improvements, and demonstrate the power of this technique! This kernel is the same as my support vector machine kernel [here][2] with QDA and pseudo labeling added. It achieves an impresive CV 0.970 and LB 0.969\n\nIn Santander's Customer Transaction competition, team Wizardry used pseudo labeling to increase their private LB by 0.0005 allowing them to beat second place by 0.0002 for the $25,000 prize! [here][3]\n\nIn \"Instant Gratification\" competition, we are building 512 models where each model's train data has approximately 512 rows and 40 columns. With 40 variables, a quadratic model would like more rows. With pseudo labeling, we can get an additional 400 rows of training data and increase CV and LB by 0.005!\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/nroman/i-m-overfitting-and-i-know-it/notebook\n[2]: https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/support-vector-machine-0-925\n[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/discussion/89003","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is Pseudo Labeling?\nPseudo labeling is the process of adding confident predicted test data to your training data. Pseudo labeling is a 5 step process. (1) Build a model using training data. (2) Predict labels for an unseen test dataset. (3) Add confident predicted test observations to our training data (4) Build a new model using combined data. And (5) use your new model to predict the test data and submit to Kaggle. Here is a pictorial explanation using sythetic 2D data. \n  \n## Step 1 - Build first model\nGiven 50 training observations (25 target=1 yellow points, 25 target=0 blue points) build a model using QDA. Notice how QDA calculates the two multivariate Gaussian distributions that the target=1 and target=0 were drawn from. QDA's approximation is represented as ellipses of 1, 2, 3 standard deviations for each distribution.\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/2020/p16419.png)\n\n## Step 2 - Predict test data\nUsing our model (ellipses), predict the target of 50 unknown data points. The bottom picture shows the decisions made by our classifier.\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/2020/p26419.png)\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/2020/p36419.png)\n\n## Step 3 and 4 - Add pseudo label data and build second model\nAdd all predictions with `Pr(y=1|x)>0.99` and `Pr(y=0|x)>0.99` to our training data. Then train a new model using the combined 90 points with QDA. The red ellipses show QDA's new approximation of the two Gaussian distributions. This time QDA has found better ellipses then before.\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/2020/p46419.png)\n\n## Step 5 - Predict test data\nFinally use our more accurate QDA ellipses to predict test (a second time) and submit to Kaggle.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Why does Pseudo Labeling work?\nWhen I first learned about pseudo labeling (from team Wizardry's 1st place solution [here][1]), I was surprised that it could increase a model's accuracy. How does training with unknown data that has been labeled by a model improve that same model? Doesn't the model already know the information? Because the model made those predictions.\n\nHow pseudo labeling works is best understood with QDA. QDA works by using points in p-dimensional space to find hyper-ellipsoids, see [here][2]. With more points, QDA can better estimate the center and shape of each ellipsoid (and consequently make better preditions afterward).\n\nPseudo labeling helps all types of models because all models can be visualized as finding shapes of target=1 and target=0 in p-dimensional space. See [here][3] for examples. More points allow for better estimation of shapes.\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/discussion/89003\n[2]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instant-gratification/discussion/93843\n[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instant-gratification/discussion/94179","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Apply Pseudo Labeling to Instant Gratification Comp\n## Load Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np, pandas as pd, os\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-31T02:44:26.870642Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-31T02:44:26.871153Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-31T02:44:59.090938Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-31T02:44:26.871105Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-31T02:44:59.089787Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 1 and 2 - Build first QDA model and predict test","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# INITIALIZE VARIABLES\ncols = [c for c in train.columns if c not in ['id', 'target']]\ncols.remove('wheezy-copper-turtle-magic')\noof = np.zeros(len(train))\npreds = np.zeros(len(test))\n\n# BUILD 512 SEPARATE MODELS\nfor i in range(512):\n    # ONLY TRAIN WITH DATA WHERE WHEEZY EQUALS I\n    train2 = train[train['wheezy-copper-turtle-magic']==i]\n    test2 = test[test['wheezy-copper-turtle-magic']==i]\n    if (len(train2)==0)&(len(test2)==0): continue\n    idx1 = train2.index;

When you submit this solution to Kaggle, your submission will load the full `test.csv` and pseudo label both the public and private test data set. Thus you will approximately double your amount of training data for your submissions!","metadata":{}}]}
