Or what does it exactly mean when we say \"kicking it harder\"? Data from NFL games reveal to us some insight which I'd like to share with you in this notebook.\n\nKickoff play is the most common type in special plays from season 2018 to 2020. Even though with six different outcomes, the kicking team has basically one ultimate goal - gaining as many yards as possible after the session ends. In this notebook, I'd bring up the **kick length** of the ball as an actionable and robust metric to evaluate how good a kickoff it is. This metric has a high positive association with the number of gained yards, since the receiving team needs to return the ball from a very low yard line if the ball is kicked long distance. Apart from that, with using the multiple linear regression method, I also find two relevant variables which might affect the kick length. Those are \n\n1. **Foot speed** in the approach, usually seen in a long approach distance, and it is also a predictor of the last step length, which is related with how much engergy will be transmitted to the ball, according to the formula of kinetic energy.\n\n2. The **direction of the ball being kicked to**. If the ball was kicked to the right side of the kicker, the length is usually shorter than to the center or to the left. The hypothesis behind is kicking to the right takes more energy from the body because of a larger pivoting angle. This cost of energy results in less volume brought to the ball.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport statsmodels.api as sm # using linear regression library for analysis\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr # calculating pearson correlation\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\n# ployly is the main tool for visualization in this notebook\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\n# make sure the code in plotly is able to run properly\nfrom plotly.offline import plot, iplot, init_notebook_mode\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n\n# Style for the visualization\nfonts = ['Rockwell','Oswald','Lato']\ncolors = ['#013369','#013f82','#0264ce','#d50a0a','#ffffff']\n\n# remove unnecessary warnings in the output\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None  # default='warn'\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-05T13:25:15.20162Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-05T13:25:15.202703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-05T13:25:15.213258Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-05T13:25:15.202628Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-05T13:25:15.212642Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Kickoff as a special team play <a id=\"kickoff\"></a>\n\n**Special teams** are units that are on the field during kicking plays.

NFL introduced new rules on the touchback -\n\n> Kickoffs that hit the end zone without being touched by a member of the receiving team automatically become touchbacks([3](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/07/06/another-tweak-to-the-kickoff-rule-promotes-more-touchbacks/)).\n\nFor years, the automatic touchback rule has applied to punts that enter the end zone, with or without being touched. For kickoffs, the touchback becomes automatic only if it strikes the ground in the end zone without being touched by a member of the receiving team; the player can still catch the kickoff and choose to return it. It’s not a change that will come into play very often, but it’s another example of the league’s broader effort to encourage touchbacks on kickoffs.\n\n\nThis policy pushes the touchback to a more popular status since 2018, as we can see it in the chart below.

Considering the ultimate goal is to take the ball towards the end zone of the opponent side, one relevant metric could be how much yards the kickoff team gained after the play. In other words, it is the net yards gained by the kicking team, including penalty yardage, which is documented as the **playResult** in the **Play** data dataset.\n\nOn the contrary, for the receiving team, the goal of them is to limit the gained yard of the kick team as small as possible, or we can say, they should return the ball as further as they can once they possess it. \n\nIf we break down the performance by kickoff outcome, we'll see the **Return** is the most exciting one due to its wide range of potential yards the kickoff team can gain. Unlike the other types of outcome, a kicking team could possibly lose yards in the play which makes the game a bit risky. But on the other hand, they could also gain yards over 40 yards in the return.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# select column

Before diving into what the data reveals to us, let's re-cap some physics at first. The whole process of kicking a ball is a transition of energy from the kicker's body to the ball. The energy exists due to the motion of an object is known as **Kinetic Energy**. Here is its formula ([4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy)) -\n> **KE = 1/2 * m$v^2$**\n\ninidicating that, given the mass of the kicker's body is unchanged, **the higher the velocity of the kicking leg, the more energy it will be generated and transmitted to the ball**, which contributes to a longer kick length. \n\nBased on the knowledge above, here we come up with two assumptions -\n* The part of the body contacting the ball is the kicker's foot, so ultimately, **is the speed of the kicking foot a useful predictor for kick length?** \n* **Does knowing the body orientation makes a difference in terms of the kicking length?** - Assuming since much more angle pivoted of the body will absorb more energy from transmitting to the ball\n\n\nBy using multiple linear regression, we can see from the output that \n\n* The **kicker_s_50**, i.e. the median of the kicker's speed, which we use as a proxy of the foot speed in this case, is positively correlated with the kick length. It indicates that comparing two kicks that the ball was being kicked to the same direction, the one kicker has a faster speed by 1 yard per 0.1 second, its estimated kick length is **~7.1** units longer than the slower one.\n\n* The **direction of the ball being kicked to** is also postively associated with the kick length. The result implies that comparing three kicks with the same kicker's foot speed, if the ball was being kicked to the right, the kick length is estimated to be shorter by **~6.8** units, **~5.2** units than to the center or to the left, respectively.\n\n* The model fit above has an R-squared value as 0.257, which indicates that **25.7%** of the variation of the kick length can be explained by the two independent variables, kicking foot speed and direction, together.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# get tracking data of the kicker and the ball\n# load tracking

Inspired by that paper, I was looking at whether there is a strong association between the foot speed and the last step length. I used the data **dis**, the distance traveled from prior time point, in yards (numeric), as a measure for estimating the length of the last step of each kick. And the outcome is promising. We can clearly see that the longer the last step length, the faster speed of the kick's foot. The foot speed has a very high positive correlation (**95.6%**) with the larger last step length before the kick, which usually indicates a larger angle of the pelvis. \n\n> So for the NFL professions and fans, if you see a kicker has a very large step before kicking the ball, it usually means he runs very fast towards the ball and the length of the kick shouldn't be short.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# calculate Pearson's correlation\ncorr, _ = pearsonr(kickoff_move_player_data['kicker_s_50'], kickoff_move_player_data['kicker_last_step'])\nprint('The correlation between foot speed and the last step length: %.3f' % corr)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-05T14:00:28.256577Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-05T14:00:28.257474Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-05T14:00:28.264728Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-05T14:00:28.257419Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-05T14:00:28.263821Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Apart from that, it is also found that a longer approach run can help you accelerate to the high speed before contacting the ball - the correlation between the two is highly positive, **~55%**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# calculate Pearson's correlation\ncorr, _ = pearsonr(kickoff_move_player_data['kicker_s_50'], kickoff_move_player_data['kicker_approach_dis'])\nprint('The correlation between foot speed and the approach distance: %.3f' % corr)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-05T14:00:55.33885Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-05T14:00:55.339221Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-05T14:00:55.348107Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-05T14:00:55.339185Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-05T14:00:55.347026Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Variable 2 - Body orientation <a id=\"orientation\"></a>\nAnother interesting fact is the ball kicked to the right direction usually has a shorter length than the one to the left or to the middle.

It also reveals from data, that two potential drivers to a long kick length. Those are \n    * foot speed\n    * kicking direction\n* Adding new measures of the tracking could benefit the research on a more granuarly level.
