In order to limit the return yards, the kickoff team wants to get down the field and meet ther returner as fast as possible. Thus, player max speed reached during the initial sprint (before they are blocked / obstructed by the return team) can be a valuable metric to analyze those on the kickoff team. However, taking the raw average of max speed can be decieving as other factors, such as field surface, can have an effect on player speeds as well. This demo will show how to model player speeds on kickoff coverage unit while accounting for surface.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://operations.nfl.com/images/infocus-rules/evolution-of-kickoff-poster.jpg\" style=\"width:500px;\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ReadData\"></a>\n# Read Data\n\nBefore we can do anything, we must read in the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-22T15:53:48.866964Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-22T15:53:48.867793Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-22T15:53:48.892236Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-22T15:53:48.867685Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-22T15:53:48.891612Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##reading in non-tracking data\n\n#includes info on games\ndf_games = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/games.csv\")\n\n#includes play-by-play info on specific plays\ndf_plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/plays.csv\")\n\n#includes background info for players\ndf_players = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/players.csv\")\n\n#Reading tracking data (2020 only for this case)\ndf_tracking = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/tracking2020.csv\")\n\n#includes scouting info on specific plays\ndf_PFFScouting = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/PFFScoutingData.csv\")\n\n#loading data from Lee Sharpe's public GitHub repository.
