NLP system needs to understand text, sign, and semantic properly. There are many methods that help the NLP system to understand text and symbols (Meparlad, 2020):\n\n* Text classification: the process of categorizing the text into a group of words and assigning a set of predefined tags or categories based on its context.\n\n* Vector semantic: defines semantic and interprets words meaning to explain features such as similar words and opposite words. The main idea behind vector semantic is two words are alike if they have used in a similar context. Vector semantic is useful in sentiment analysis.\n\n* Word embedding: translates spares vectors into a low-dimensional space that preserves semantic relationships. Word embedding is a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.\n\n* Probabilistic language model: calculates the probability of a sentence of a sequence of words.\n\n* Sequence labeling: assigns a class or label to each token in a given input sequence.\n\nFor this project, the focus is text processing and labeling: we want to look for scientific articles in a body of text and subsequently classify them with predefined labels. This is a big challenge since sequence prediction is considered as one of the hardest problems to solve in the data science industry.\n\nWe will discuss how to approach any NLP problem with techniques like n-gram, sequence vector, and spaCy NER. We will look at:\n\n### Steps\n1. Obtain Data\n2. Data Scrubbing & Exploration\n3. Data Annotation: Getting Train & Test Sentences\n4. Data Preprocessing\n5. Feature Extraction\n6. Part 1: Building n-gram Models\n7. Part 2: Building RNN Models: Bidirectional LSTM & GRU Model\n8. Part 3: Building CNN Model: sep-CNN Model\n9. Part 4: Building spaCy NER Model\n10. Prediction on Test Set\n11. Prepare Submission Data\n\n## BUSINESS STATEMENTS\n\n1. Can natural language processing find the hidden-in-plain-sight data citations?\n\n2. Can machine learning find the link between the words used in research articles and the data referenced in the article?\n\n## METHODOLOGY\n\nIn this competition, natural language processing (NLP) is used to automate the discovery of how scientific data are referenced in publications. I attempted:\n\n* n-gram models (blog, n-gram notebook)\n* Recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning models (blog, Bidirectional LSTM notebook, GRU notebook)\n* Convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models (blog, sep-CNN notebook)\n* spaCy NER (blog, spaCy notebook)\n\n### Metrics\n\nThe performance of the models are evaluated based on:\n* Accuracy score\n* Precision: True Negative (TN) or specificity to determine how good the model is at detecting negatives (Normal)\n* Recall: True Positive (TP) or sensitivity to determine how good the model is at detecting the positives (Pneumonia)\n* F1: harmonic mean of precision and recall\n\n## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS\n\n|#  |Model                            |Accuracy|CV  |Precision|Recall|F1  |\n|---|---------------------------------|--------|----|---------|------|----|\n|0  |CLF RandomForestClassifier       |0.75    |0.78|0.44     |0.45  |0.44|\n|1  |CLF Linear Support Vector Machine|0.62    |0.62|0.21     |0.09  |0.11|\n|2  |CLF MultinomialNB                |0.64    |0.62|0.25     |0.10  |0.12|\n|3  |DL GRU                           |0.83    |-   |0.29     |0.33  |0.3 |\n|4  |DL Bidirectional LSTM            |0.83    |-   |0.28     |0.31  |0.28|\n|5  |DL sep-CNN                       |0.48    |-   |0.0      |0.01  |0.01|\n|6  |spaCy NER                        |80.73   |-   |-        |-     |-   |\n\nThis discussion only aims at how to preprocess text and build models. Although accuracy is acceptable, Precision/ Recall/ and F1 are very low. More works are needed to be done in the future.\n\n## ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n1.With supervised learning algorithms, large annotated data for training is required which are expensive and often take a lot of time. Future efforts could be dedicated on providing more effective deep transfer learning models and exploring appropriate data augmentation techniques (He et al., 2020).\n\n2.Most neural models for sequence labeling do not scale well because when the size of data grows, the parameters of models increase exponentially, leading to the high complexity of back propagation. There exists need for developing approaches to balance model complexity and scalability (He et al., 2020).\n\n3.Increasing access to confidential data presumed significantly increasing privacy risks. However, the country’s laws and practices are not currently optimized to support the use of data for evidence building, nor in a manner that best protects privacy. We need to improve data security and privacy protections beyond what exists today (US CEP, 2017).\n\n## FUTURE WORKS\n\n* Spend more time on gathering, cleaning and visualizing data\n* Correct highly imbalanced dataset\n* More focus on tweaking the hyper-parameters","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It

PREPROCESSING FOR N-GRAM MODELS\n\nModels that process the tokens independently i.e. not taking into account word order, is called n-gram models. An n-gram model is the simplest model that assigns probabilities to sentences and sequences of words. An n-gram is a sequence of n-words in a sentence, for example, a 2-gram or bigram is a two-word sequence of words and a 3-gram or trigram is three-word sequence of words.\n\nWith n-gram, we discard a lot of information about word order and grammar. This is called a bag-of-words approach. This representation is used in conjunction with models that don't take ordering into account, such as logistic regression, multi-layer perceptrons, gradient boosting machines, support vector machines. \n\nAs such, for this part of the project, we will build 3 n-gram models:\n* **Model 1: RandomForestClassifier**\n* **Model 2 : Linear Support Vector Machine**\n* **Model 3: MultinomialNB**\n\n## Summary of Steps\n* Tokenize text samples into word in the range of (1, 4)-grams\n* Vectorize using tf-idf encoding\n* Select only the top 20,000 features from the vector of tokens by discarding tokens that appear fewer than 2 times and using f_classif to calculate feature importance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Train-Test-Split","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We need to split our dataset into a training and validation set.

However, CNN can also be applied to NLP. Instead of image pixels, sentences or documents represented as a matrix are the input. Each row of the matrix corresponds to one token, typically a word, but it could be a character. In vision, our filters slide over local patches of an image, but in NLP we typically use filters that slide over full rows of the matrix (words) (Britz, 2016).\n\nUsing CNN for NLP is counterintuitive since in vision, pixels close to each other are likely to be semantically related but in language, parts of phrases could be separated by several other words. However, Britz (2016) argues, if the simple Bag of Words model, which is an obvious oversimplification with incorrect assumptions, can be the standard approach for years and with good results, CNN, arguably can also be used for NLP. Moreover, compared to something like n-gram which can quickly become expensive when computing anything more than 3-grams, CNNs are much more efficient.
