Evidence through data is critical if government is to address the many threats facing society, including; pandemics, climate change, Alzheimer’s disease, child hunger, increasing food production, maintaining biodiversity, and addressing many other challenges. Yet much of the information about data necessary to inform evidence and science is locked inside publications.\n\nCan natural language processing find the hidden-in-plain-sight data citations? Can machine learning find the link between the words used in research articles and the data referenced in the article?\n\nNow is the time for data scientists to help restore trust in data and evidence. In the United States, federal agencies are now mandated to show how their data are being used. The new Foundations of Evidence-based Policymaking Act requires agencies to modernize their data management. New Presidential Executive Orders are pushing government agencies to make evidence-based decisions based on the best available data and science. And the government is working to respond in an open and transparent way.\n\nThis competition will build just such an open and transparent approach. The results will show how public data are being used in science and help the government make wiser, more transparent public investments. It will help move researchers and governments from using ad-hoc methods to automated ways of finding out what datasets are being used to solve problems, what measures are being generated, and which researchers are the experts. Previous competitions have shown that it is possible to develop algorithms to automate the search and discovery of references to data. Now, we want the Kaggle community to develop the best approaches to identify critical datasets used in scientific publications.\n\nIn this competition, you'll use natural language processing (NLP) to automate the discovery of how scientific data are referenced in publications. Utilizing the full text of scientific publications from numerous research areas gathered from CHORUS publisher members and other sources, you'll identify data sets that the publications' authors used in their work.\n\nIt achieves this goal by working with the agencies to create value for the taxpayer from the careful use of data by building new technologies to enable secure access to and sharing of confidential microdata and by training agency staff to acquire modern data skills.\n\nIf successful, you'll help support evidence in government data. Automated NLP approaches will enable government agencies and researchers to quickly find the information they need. The approach will be used to develop data usage scorecards to better enable agencies to show how their data are used and bring down a critical barrier to the access and use of public data.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.07102,"end_time":"2021-06-16T14:11:44.843574","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-06-16T14:11:44.772554","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='1'></a>\n# <p style=\"background-color:blue; font-family:newtimeroman; font-size:120%; text-align:center; border-radius: 10px 25px;color:white;\">Table of Content</p>\n* [1.
