It can be of use in identifying, for a given historical game, what round it occurred in, and what the seeds/slots were for the two teams (the meaning of \"slots\" is described below). Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. You may need to know these specifics if you are trying to represent/simulate the exact workings of the tournament bracket.\n\n* **Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs)\n* **Slot** - this uniquely identifies one of the tournament games. For play-in games, it is a three-character string identifying the seed fulfilled by the winning team, such as W16 or Z13. For regular tournament games, it is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. Even if that R2W1 slot were actually a game between the W09 and W16 teams, it is still considered to be the R2W1 slot. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game. The \"slot\" value is used in other columns in order to represent the advancement and pairings of winners of previous games.\n* **StrongSeed** - this indicates the expected stronger-seeded team that plays in this game. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column. In the first record of this file (slot R1W1), we see that seed W01 is the \"StrongSeed\", which during the 1985 tournament would have been Georgetown. Whereas for games from Round 2 or later, rather than a team seed, we will see a \"slot\" referenced in this column. So in the 33rd record of this file (slot R2W1), it tells us that the winners of slots R1W1 and R1W8 will face each other in Round 2. Of course, in the last few games of the tournament - the national semifinals and finals - it's not really meaningful to talk about a \"strong seed\" or \"weak seed\", since you would have #1 seeds favored to face each other, but those games are nevertheless represented in the same format for the sake of consistency.\n* **WeakSeed** - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game, assuming all favored teams have won so far. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WNCAATourneySlots.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:02:49.160353Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:02:49.16067Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:02:49.173278Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:02:49.160636Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:02:49.172229Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# WRegularSeasonCompactResults\nThis file identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 1985 season (the first year the NCAA® had a 64-team tournament).

For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n* **DayNum** - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"MSeasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=20. Combined with the fact from the \"MSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/29/1984 that year, this means the first game was played 20 days later, or 11/18/1984. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID). In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day because of a tornado, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day. In order to enforce this uniqueness, we moved the game date for the Georgia-Kentucky game back to its original scheduled date.\n* **WTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"MTeams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game, the \"WTeamID\" always identifies the winning team.\n* **WScore** - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n* **LTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n* **LScore** - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n* **WLoc** - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team. If you would like to investigate this factor more closely, we invite you to explore Data Section 3, which provides the city that each game was played in, irrespective of whether it was considered to be a neutral site.\n* **NumOT** - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WRegularSeasonCompactResults.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:02:53.39138Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:02:53.391728Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:02:53.40537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:02:53.391694Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:02:53.404665Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Toal Seasons:{}\".format(WRegularSeasonCompactResults.Season.nunique()))\nWRegularSeasonCompactResults.Season.value_counts().sort_index()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:03:00.221447Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:03:00.221964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:03:00.236203Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:03:00.221925Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:03:00.234687Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WRegularSeasonCompactResults, x='WLoc');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:03:03.109205Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:03:03.109872Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:03:03.419702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:03:03.109823Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:03:03.419Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WRegularSeasonCompactResults, x='NumOT');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:03:06.189689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:03:06.190257Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:03:06.386598Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:03:06.190206Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:03:06.385765Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 10))\nsns.countplot(data=WRegularSeasonCompactResults, y='Season');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:03:09.159003Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:03:09.159542Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:03:09.475711Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:03:09.159495Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:03:09.474851Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.histplot(WRegularSeasonCompactResults.groupby(\"WTeamID\").apply(lambda x: len(x)).values, bins=25);\nplt.title(\"Distribution of total number of wins by each teams\")\nplt.show();","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:03:12.390435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:03:12.391004Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:03:12.670258Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:03:12.390952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:03:12.669322Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# WRegularSeasonDetailedResults\nThis file provides team-level box scores for many regular seasons of historical data, starting with the 2003 season.

Remember that the current season counts as 2022.\n* **DayZero** - tells you the date corresponding to DayNum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) the Monday championship game of the men's tournament is on DayNum=154. Working backward, the national semifinals are always on DayNum=152, the \"play-in\" games are on days 135, Selection Sunday is on day 132, the final day of the regular season is also day 132, and so on. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you need to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"DayNum\" with the season's \"DayZero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on DayNum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.\n* **RegionW, RegionX, Region Y, Region Z** - by our contests' convention, each of the four regions in the final tournament is assigned a letter of W, X, Y, or Z. Whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region W. And whichever Region plays against Region W in the national semifinals, that will be Region X. For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files, even if the region names change from year to year. For instance, during the 2012 tournament, the four regions were East, Midwest, South, and West. Being the first alphabetically, East becomes W. Since the East regional champion (Ohio State) played against the Midwest regional champion (Kansas) in the national semifinals, that makes Midwest be region X. For the other two (South and West), since South comes first alphabetically, that makes South Y and therefore West is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are East,Midwest,South,West. And so for instance, Ohio State, the #2 seed in the East, is listed in the MNCAATourneySeeds file that year with a seed of W02, meaning they were the #2 seed in the W region (the East region). We will not know the final W/X/Y/Z designations until Selection Sunday, because the national semifinal pairings in the Final Four will depend upon the overall ranks of the four #1 seeds.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WSeasons.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:05:29.42241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:05:29.423377Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:05:29.437469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:05:29.423319Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:05:29.436373Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Total Seasons: {}'.format(WSeasons.Season.nunique()))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:05:33.252499Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:05:33.252828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:05:33.258802Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:05:33.252792Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:05:33.257968Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WSeasons, x='RegionW');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:05:44.98182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:05:44.982138Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:05:45.253491Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:05:44.982105Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:05:45.252472Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WSeasons, x='RegionX');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:05:50.530034Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:05:50.530345Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:05:50.839557Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:05:50.530315Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:05:50.838341Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WSeasons, x='RegionY');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:05:56.832224Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:05:56.833287Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:05:57.096484Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:05:56.83321Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:05:57.095586Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=WSeasons, x='RegionZ');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:06:02.771389Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:06:02.771994Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:06:03.053036Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:06:02.771956Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:06:03.052061Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WSeasons[\"Day_of_year\"] = pd.to_datetime(WSeasons[\"DayZero\"]).apply(lambda x: x.day_of_year)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.lineplot(x=WSeasons.Season, y=WSeasons.Day_of_year);\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T10:06:12.748016Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T10:06:12.748299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T10:06:12.98666Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T10:06:12.74827Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T10:06:12.985441Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<h1 align='center'> <b>Work in Progress!</b> </h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:yellow;\" style=\"font-family:verdana;\"> ⬆️⬆️⬆️ If you find this note book helpful. <b>please upvote!</b> ⬆️⬆️⬆️ </h1>","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.059245Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.059603Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.067713Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.05957Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.066228Z"}}}]}
