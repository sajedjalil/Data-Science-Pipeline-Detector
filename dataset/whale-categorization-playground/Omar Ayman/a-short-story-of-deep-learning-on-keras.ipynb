This type of categorical variable is called an ordinal variable.\n\nWhat is the Problem with Categorical Data?\nSome algorithms can work with categorical data directly.\n\nFor example, a decision tree can be learned directly from categorical data with no data transform required (this depends on the specific implementation).\n\nMany machine learning algorithms cannot operate on label data directly. They require all input variables and output variables to be numeric.\n\nIn general, this is mostly a constraint of the efficient implementation of machine learning algorithms rather than hard limitations on the algorithms themselves.\n\nThis means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical form. If the categorical variable is an output variable, you may also want to convert predictions by the model back into a categorical form in order to present them or use them in some application.\n\nHow to Convert Categorical Data to Numerical Data?\nThis involves two steps:\n\nInteger Encoding\nOne-Hot Encoding\n**1. Integer Encoding\n**As a first step, each unique category value is assigned an integer value.\n\nFor example, “red” is 1, “green” is 2, and “blue” is 3.\n\nThis is called a label encoding or an integer encoding and is easily reversible.\n\nFor some variables, this may be enough.\n\nThe integer values have a natural ordered relationship between each other and machine learning algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.\n\nFor example, ordinal variables like the “place” example above would be a good example where a label encoding would be sufficient.\n\n**2. One-Hot Encoding\n**For categorical variables where no such ordinal relationship exists, the integer encoding is not enough.\n\nIn fact, using this encoding and allowing the model to assume a natural ordering between categories may result in poor performance or unexpected results (predictions halfway between categories).\n\nIn this case, a one-hot encoding can be applied to the integer representation. This is where the integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each unique integer value.\n\nIn the “color” variable example, there are 3 categories and therefore 3 binary variables are needed. A “1” value is placed in the binary variable for the color and “0” values for the other colors.\n\nFor example:\n------------------------------\n\nred,\tgreen,\tblue\n1,\t\t0,\t\t0\n0,\t\t1,\t\t0\n0,\t\t0,\t\t1\n1\n2\n3\n4\nred,\tgreen,\tblue\n1,\t\t0,\t\t0\n0,\t\t1,\t\t0\n0,\t\t0,\t\t1"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2e17ded71b8a2aa18a74e72a23f3b957ff4d1bfa","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\n\nlabels1= preprocessing.LabelEncoder()\nlabels1.fit(labels)\nencodedlabels = labels1.transform(labels) #integer encoding\nclearalllabels = np_utils.to_categorical(encodedlabels) #one hot encoding\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c48678457efb687f1d9af837f4c379e81fe802a8","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9627687897ee5a4913ed788550581e8bb3497082"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Here fun begins ,\n**\nwe are creating a function with 2 arguments (imagepath and the image name) and this fn will read the image , check if the channels is more than 1 i.e the pictured is colored for the value 3 and convert it back to gray scale for the sake of memory , put it as float in order to normalize it in step 3,4 \n**Normalization\n**\nthe most commonly used normalization — making the data zero mean and unit variance along each feature. That is, given the data matrix X, where rows represent training instances and columns represent features, you compute the normalized matrix Xnorm with element (i,j) given by\n\nXnorm,(i,j)=X(i,j)−mean(Xj)std(Xj)\n\nwhere Xj is the jth column of matrix X.\n\nThere are several advantages of doing that, many of which are interrelated:\n\nMakes training less sensitive to the scale of features: Consider a regression problem where you’re given features of an apartment and are required to predict the price of the apartment. Let’s say there are 2 features — no. of bedrooms and the area of the apartment. Now, the no. of bedrooms will be in the range 1–4 typically, while the area will be in the range 100–200m2. If you’re modelling the task as linear regression, you want to solve for coefficients w1 and w2 corresponding to no. of bedrooms and area. Now, because of the scale of the features, a small change in w2 will change the prediction by a lot compared to the same change in w1, to the point that setting w2 correctly might dominate the optimization process.\nRegularization behaves differently for different scaling: Suppose you have an ℓ2 regularization on the problem above. It is easy to see that ℓ2 regularization pushes larger weights towards zero more strongly than smaller weights. So consider that you obtain some optimal values of w1 and w2 using your given unnormalized data matrix X. Now instead of using m2 as the unit of area, if I change the data to represent area in ft2, the corresponding column of X will get multiplied by a factor of ~10. Therefore, you would expect the corresponding optimal coefficient w2 to go down by a factor of 10 to maintain the value of y. But, as stated before, the ℓ2 regularization now has a smaller effect because of the smaller value of the coefficient. So you will end up getting a larger value of w2 than you would have expected. This does not make sense — you did not change the information content of the data, and therefore, your optimal coefficients should not have changed.\nConsistency for comparing results across models: As covered in point 2, scaling of features affects performance. So, if there are scientists developing new methods, and compare previous state-of-the-art methods with their new methods, which uses more carefully chosen scaling, then the results will not be reliable.\nMakes optimization well-conditioned: Most machine learning optimizations are solved using gradient descent, or a variant thereof. And the speed of convergence depends on the scaling of features (or more precisely, the eigenvalues of XTX). Normalization makes the problem better conditioned, improving the convergence rate of gradient descent. I give an intuition of this using a simple example below.\nConsider the simplest case where A is a 2 x 2 diagonal matrix, say A=diag([a1,a2]). Then, the contours of the objective function ∥Ax−b∥2 will be axis-aligned ellipses as shown in the figure below:\n\n\nSuppose you start at the point marked in red. Observe that to reach the optimal point, you need to take a very large step in the horizontal direction but a small step in the vertical direction. The descent direction is given by the green arrow. If you go along this direction, then you will move larger distance in the vertical direction and smaller distance in the horizontal direction, which is the opposite of what you want to do!\n\nIf you take a small step along the gradient, covering the large horizontal distance to the optimal is going to take a large number of steps. If you take a large step along the gradient, you will overshoot the optimal in the vertical direction.\n\nThis behavior is due to the shape of the contours. The more circular the contours are, the faster you will converge to the optimal. The elongation of the ellipses is given by the ratio of the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the matrix A. In general, the convergence of an optimization problem is measured by its condition number, which in this case is the ratio of the two extreme eigenvalues.\n\n(Prasoon Goyal's answer to Why is the Speed Of Convergence of gradient descent depends on the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of A in solving AX=b through least squares.)\n\nFinally, I should mention that normalization does not always help, as far as performance is concerned. Here's a simple example : consider a problem with only one feature with variance 1. Now suppose I add a dummy feature with variance 0.01. If you regularize your model correctly, the solution will not change much because of this dummy dimension. But if you now normalize it to have unit variance, it might hurt the performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthen creating a list and loop through a  loop with the length of training images saving these images to the list we have created"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import cv2\ndef imageProcessing(imagepath,name): \n    img=cv2.imread(imagepath)\n    height,width,channels=img.shape\n    if channels !=1:\n        img = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)\n    img=img.astype(np.float)\n    img = cv2.resize(img,(70,70))\n    img = img-img.min()//img.max()-img.min()#step 3\n    img=img*255#step 4\n    return img\nt=[]\n    \nfor i in range(0,9850):\n    t.append(imageProcessing(df.imagepath[i],df.Image[i]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"741683757fe6137e6d841ae885f1d49b81036086"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Put t in the form of an array to be able to reshape it so we can feed it to the ImageGenerator that we will be discussing later"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2330666d4bea550b645d9422b1a0610440d59296","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"t = np.asarray(t)\nt=t.reshape(-1,70,70,1)\nt.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d4ddddf7d3bf14ec085a9e9f6761cc9d239851ce"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Same for test images\nfrom glob import glob\npath_to_images = '../input/test/*.jpg'\nimages=glob(path_to_images)\ntest=[]\nfor i in images:\n    img = cv2.imread(i)\n    height,width,channels=img.shape\n    if channels !=1:\n        img = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)\n    img=img.astype(np.float)\n    img = cv2.resize(img,(70,70))\n    img = img-img.min()//img.max()-img.min()\n    img=img*255\n\n    test.append(cv2.resize(img,(70,70)))\n    # Get image label (folder name)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8e278403466e8ca701b13a3dc95e9552d43570ac","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"t.shape\ntest=np.asarray(test)\ntest.shape\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9a131b568d03afb6f156dc08c5137b9f6ab09ee3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Data Augmentation**\nOverfitting is caused by having too few samples to learn from, rendering you unable to train a model that can generalize to new data.

Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more training data\nfrom existing training samples, by augmenting the samples via a number of random transformations that yield believable-looking images. The goal is that at training time,\nyour model will never see the exact same picture twice.
