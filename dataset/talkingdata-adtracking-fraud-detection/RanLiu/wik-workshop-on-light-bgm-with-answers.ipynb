Brief Introduction\n\nFor this competition, your objective is to predict whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app advertisement. The training dataset is 1.21 GB, incuding records of 180 milion clicks with ip, app, device, os, channel, click_time as main features, and is_attributed (whether the app is downloaded or not) as the target variable to be predicted. Please refer to the [competition overview](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection) for details.\n\nThis is a very big dataset and kaggle kernel cannot handle training with the full data. If you have a super computer, you can download the full dataset and train locally. However, it is still possible to participate the competition with a laptop. First of all, we are going to go through some simple tricks during the data loading process. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6dee8b010792767b170525feeccab30d9d8277c4","_cell_guid":"0dc511d5-b0fc-4b0e-8695-fe4415f008d8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
