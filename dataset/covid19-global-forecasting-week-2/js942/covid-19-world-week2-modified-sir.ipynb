Given the high number of anecdotes regarding under-counting, lack of testing, and an overwhelmed medical system, which pieces of the data can we use reliably? If we rely on those, do we end up with reasonable predictions of future data?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n - [SIR Model](#section_sir)\n - [Notebook setup](#section_background)\n - [EDA](#section_EDA)\n - [Models](#section_models)\n - [Model Evaluations](#section_model_evaluations)\n - [Conclusion](#section_conclusion)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section_sir'></a>\n## Classic SIR model \nThe classic SIR model describes a disease progression for each individual as\n\n**S**usceptible -> **I**nfected -> **R**esolved\n\nand has 3 governing equations\n* **dS/dt** = (-1 x BETA x S x I)/N\n* **dI/dt** = (BETA x S x I)/N - (GAMMA x I)\n* **dR/dt** = GAMMA x I\n\nwhere **N** is the total population and the two factors \n\n* **BETA** (transmission factor that moves individuals from S to I)\n* **GAMMA** (recovery factor that moves individuals from I to R)\n\nare specific to the disease being modelled.\n\n\n## Modified SIR model\n\nThe model used here is a modified SIR where the modifications are factors to estimate the true counts for I and R, namely \n* I = i_factor * ConfirmedCases\n* R = r_factor * Fatalities\n\n### S = the number of susceptible people \n  - Since there has not been a vaccine, this study assumes that the starting value for S is the total population of the country or region.\n  - The total population of a country is probably not the best estimator. The number of susceptible people in each densely populated and infected region would likely be a better predictor, and perhaps the density of the population would further improve that. Unfortunately, this level of granularity (cities, towns) is not currently available in the data.\n   * In the SIR model, S + I + R = N = total_population at all points in time. We can calculate S after calculating changes to I and R.\n  - __Conclusion__: The total population of each region will be used keeping in mind the limitations (assumptions) that this introduces to the model.\n  \n### I = the number of infected people\n * If we had perfect data, we would have I = ActiveCases.\n * Instead, we have ConfirmedCases which is believed to be under-estimated for a variety of reasons (silent carriers, inability to test all symptomatic individuals, other reporting issues).\n * __Conclusion__: The number of ConfirmedCases will be used to estimate the number of actual Infected cases, using an estimated correction factor, INFECTED = i_factor * ConfirmedCases. \n \n### R = the number of people who are resolved\n * R includes the individuals who are no longer susceptible and no longer actively infected.\n * Resolved = Recovered + Fatalities\n * Cases that were never counted as ConfirmedCases will also not be counted as recoveries.\n * Fatalities are most likely to be accurate as testing is likely to occur when individuals require a diagnostic that provides clarity into the necessary interventions, and many countries require a \"Cause of Death\" to be recorded on death certificates.\n * __Conclusion__: The number of Fatalities will be used to estimate the number of actual Resolved cases, using an estimated correction factor, RESOLVED = r_factor * Fatalities.\n     \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hypothesis and Model\n\nEssentially, our hypothesis and assumptions are:\n * SIR model is appropriate:\n  * No vaccinated or immune individuals.\n  * Exposure data is not available so the existence of an \"E\" state as in SEIR is a hidden node. S->E->I can be approximated by S->I.\n  * Quarantines are 'leaky' in that movement and interaction are reduced but not completely halted, and that unconfirmed / silent carriers are the most likely to be moving about, so SEIQR would also contain a hidden node without visibility or data.\n * Number of Fatalities is the most accurate statistic.\n * The amount of under-estimation in historic data is a good predictor of future under-estimation.\n * Factors calculated to correct for under-estimation can be used to predict future reported data.\n * The derivatives (dS/dt, dI/dt, dR/dt where ideally dt->0) can be replaced by delta-S/delta-t etc. with minimal loss of accuracy compared to other error sources:\n  * The best available dt at this point is a time delta of 1 day (resolution of the data). \n  * dS, dI, and dR are confined to integers (resolution of counting people).\n \nThis notebook implements a modified SIR as follows:\n  * BETA and GAMMA are estimated based on comparison to the seasonal flu, measles, and estimations made in the public disclosures (news and other reports).\n  * i_factor and r_factor are based on EDA of historical data.\n  * Prior to calculating (forecasting) the next values, the correction factor is applied to I and R.\n  * After calculating the next 'true' step, only the uncorrected values are saved as ConfirmedCases and Fatalities; these form the predictions.\n        \nAdditional data sources:\n 1.  Population by country from https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020). \n 1.  Population of 3711 for the Diamond Princess is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship).\n\n*Note: This notebook has room for improvement in several areas; please improve on this if you copy code! For example, some regions did not correctly get population data from the external source and are using the default value instead. i_factor and r_factor EDA could be replaced with an ML search for the best factors.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section_background'></a>\n## Notebook setup\nThis section contains imports, globals, and functions that will be used to work with the data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Week 1:\n - *Notebook for COVID-19 CA* was developed first. That notebook explored \n  - *Extended data* back to 2020-01-22 (manually added from JHU csse time series)\n  - *Initial models*\n    - 1) *NAIVE model*, akin to \"same as previous day\" but adding +5 for ConfirmedCases and +1 for Fatalities. This model performed \n    very poorly (as expected) but was an easy way to get the code set up and the first prediction submitted. \n    I considered this a \"pipe cleaner.\"\n    - 2) *SIR modified model*\n      - a simple calculation based on per-day-deltas (e.g. dS/dt is the change from one day to the next -- avoided complex math)\n      - believing that US testing is still not representative of the full extent of the infected cases (I), and further that \n        R = recoverd + fatalities while only fatalities are reported, the model was modified to SCALE both of these to estimate I and R, as in\n        - I = i_factor * ConfirmedCases\n        - R = r_factor * Fatalities\n - *Extend to WORLD*. \n   - Kept the modified SIR model with a country-keyed table of parameters. \n   - Ran out of time to customize the parameter table.\n - *Ran out of time* to upload the correctly functioning version, so the results were poor. Fortunately, I learned a lot.\n\n### Week 2:\n\n - Fit to fatalities. As in the earlier data, I believe that the data for Fatalities is more accurate than the data for ConfirmedCases, \nso the models will be built to be more accurate for the Fatalities at the potential risk of incorrectly \nestimating the ConfirmedCases.\n - SIR parameter prediction. Week 1 was focused (for me) on extending my CA notebook to WORLD data. Week 2 is \n    focused on exploring the parameter predictions and determining which input factors (population total, population density, etc.) \n    provide the best parameter fit. In theory, the parameters that provide the best fit should be CLUES to the \n    true inputs to the system. Note that I refer to these as only clues; population density may really be an indicator of cultural social distancing, housing structure, climate, or some other factor that is the true input."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np #
