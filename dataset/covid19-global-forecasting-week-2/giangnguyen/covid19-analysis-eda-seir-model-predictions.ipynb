Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n## The Challenge\nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. We are currently on week 2.\n\nWhile the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n\nAs the data becomes available, Kaggle will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n\n## Analysis\nIn this challenge, I will be analyzing the open-source data from different contributors on Kaggle to answer these critical questions:\n\n- **What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?** Ex: quarantine, cancelling large gatherings, widespread testing, etc.)\n\n- **What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?** Ex: Data on temperature, humidity and wind speed by region.\n\n- **What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?** Ex: Percentage of the population that smokes, numbers of death by lung diseses or numbers of ICU for the patients in a country.\n\n- **When should we expect the number of infected cases will start to stabilize and decrease?** \n\n- **What would be the maximum number of cases in N days?**\n\nIn addition, I will predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases as well as fatal cases in **173 countries** across the world for future dates **(ranging from April 1 - April 30)**.\n\n### Note: This is a work in progress and I will try to update the Notebook everyday with new data coming in and improve/add further analysis.\n\n**Disclaimer from Kaggle:** We understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About\n\n### COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019)\n- Caused by a SARS-COV-2 corona virus.\n- First identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Recommendations are based on my data exploration and personal perspectives. Therefore, the prediction results are solely served as reference and should not act as any concrete statement for actual future events. \n\n\n- More tuning, improvement and up-to-date data will be needed for future analysis and iteration. However, it's also fundamental to research more about the pandemic itself and learn from epidemiology experts.\n\n- It is a very statisfying experience during the #HappyAtHome self-quarantine time to learn something new, perform analysis on completely different field from what I have done before and (hopefully) provide some meaningful insights to help us combat the pandemic together.\n\n### All in all, I hope you stay safe and healthy, wash your hands, and #StayHome to help our healthcare workers who are working insanely hard in the front line!\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Further Readings:\n- [The Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Foot Traffic\n](https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns?is=5e7a66538dd3816c985d8fc7)\n\n- [Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)\n\n- [Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56)\n\n- [Flatten the curve with South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
