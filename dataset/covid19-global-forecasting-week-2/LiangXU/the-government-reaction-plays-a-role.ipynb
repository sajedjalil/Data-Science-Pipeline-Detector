The growth infection over 30 countries in the world has seen the overwhelming power of the exponential spread of COVID-19 at the early stage. While the pandemic increasingly causes damage in all aspects of people's life, no one knows how long it will last. With eventually realizing the serious situation, more and more countries start to take restrictions on people's social interactions. While the classic epidemic models succeed in predicting the exponential growth of infection, whether and to what extent the government's restriction on people's social life is effective are still hotly debated. Incorporating the external interference to the classic virus spread model adds complexity and therefore prevents analytic solutions. Hence, I present a spatially explicit social interaction model to simulate how coronavirus spreads among population, in which I consider the dynamic change of the government restriction on social activities according to how serious the pandemic becomes.   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Goal\nThe aim of this notebook is to introduce a social-interaction model on individual basis to measure how virus spreads under different speed of government reactions on social restriction. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Approach\nA simulation model is designed. By setting a set of parameters in which the speed of the government's reaction and the virulence of the virus are of great interest, one can simulate how the infection grows in a given region. Comparing the results of different scenarios may hint at the relation between the epidemic development and the speed of government's reaction.    "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model description\n\nThe model is an individual-based model. At each time step, a prescribed number (input as an argument `contactsize`) of people are sampled at a contact rate $C_{i,j}$ for each individual. The contact rate is computed for all pairs of the focal individual and the other individuals in the region. The contact rate is affected by multiple factors. First, it depends on the passions (willingness) to social activities ($Pas_i, Pas_j$) of the focal individual ($i$) and his meeting friend ($j$). If both are active to social interaction, their meeting is likely arranged, thus, leading to a high contact rate. In addition, the passion depends on individual's health state ($D_i$). If one is sick, he is not willing to go out meeting friends. The health states of all individuals are traced at each time step. Second, the contact rate is affected by the geographic distance ($d_{i,j}$) between the meeting friends. If they are far away from each other, they are not likely to meet. Third, due to the epidemic development the government restriction has influence on the contact rate. The intensity of the restriction is denoted as ($m(s,N_I)$), which is a function of the number of the infected cases ($N_I$) and the speed of reaction ($s$). Severe restriction is expected to be taken when more infected cases are confirmed, thus, reduces the contact rate to prevent virus spread. Following the intuition, the system is defined as\n\\begin{align}\nC_{i,j} &= e^{-m(s,N_I)\\cdot d^2_{i,j}} \\cdot Pas_i(D_i) \\cdot Pas_j(D_j)\\\\\nm(s,N_I) &= 2\\frac{1}{1+e^{-s\\cdot N_I/L^2}}-1\\\\\nPas_i(D_i) &= e^{\\frac{(D_i-IP)^2}{V^2}}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $L^2$ denotes the total population size of consideration, $IP$ denotes the incubation period of the virus and $V$ denotes the virulence of the virus. \nThe health states are recorded in $D_k,k=1,\\cdots,n$, which is related to time elapsed after getting infected. Thus, $D_k = 0$ denotes that the individual just gets infected. At each time step, $D_k$ is added by 1. After a recovery time period (input as an argument `recover_time`), the infected individual recovers to normal but again become susceptible to the virus. Thus, the healthy state is denoted by $D_i =$ `recover_time` which will not increase in values. This sets a upper bound to the passion function (Eq. 3) to prevent it going infinity. In the future, the mechanism of antibody of the virus that the recovered individuals have a lower chance to be reinfected can be implemented by modifying this function. Back to the model, in such a way recording the health state by elapsed days a dynamic passion to social activities based on one's health state is correctly captured. During the incubation period, the infected individual still has a certain degree of willingness to social interaction because of slight symptoms. After the incubation period, the state of illness of the individual becomes worse, which stops his outing. Eventually, the patient recovers from the illness and becomes active again. For simplicity, individual death is not modeled. The virulence ($1/V$) determines the sensitivity of the social passion to the symptom development. A large virulence (small $V$) denotes that the difference in social passions between states of illness and health is large (more convex curve in Figure 1) because severe illness substantially changes people's life style. A small virulence with a flat curve in Figure 1 accounts for little difference in social passions between illness and healthy state.      \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Simulation processes\nBefore starting simulations, a number of parameters are to be initialized.\nA squared region is initialized by setting the width of the grid (`grid_size`). This also determines the total population size in this region. Each cell hosts one individual. To trigger the epidemic, a number (`initial_virus`) of infected individuals are launched. At each time step (day), each individual can meet a certain number (`contactsize`) of friends, which can be interpreted as the connectivity or vitality of the society. The virus is characterized by setting the recovery time length (`recover_time`), the incubation time length (`incubation`) and the inversed virulence (`virulence`). The speed of the government reaction is given by `speedreaction`. The simulation is implemented in parallel. By default, 4 cpu cores are used, which can be modified by setting `num_cores=x`.\nOnce the parameters are set, one can check the curves of the following relations to get an idea of the model

However, because only slight symptoms appear the individual still has a degree of willingness to go out.

The first one is to develop an analytic likelihood formulation to the model. However, due to the complexity of the system, it is hard to achieve to my knowledge so far. Thus, some likelihood-free methods are naturally alternative avenue. \n### Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)\nApproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a kind of likelihood-free method that utilizes computational power to generate a huge amount of simulations with randomly chosen parameters to hit the target - the observations. The generating parameters that produce the results that are most analogous to the observations are chosen as the best inference of the true generating parameters. A simple version of ABC program can be found on my [blog](https://xl0418.github.io/2020/03/18/2020-03-18-generalABC/#more). But it is impossible to use in this notebook and in this competition because this individual-based simulation study together with ABC inference requires a high performance computer cluster.  \n### Deep Learning \nDeep Learning built upon multiple neural layers has advantage on recognizing character of complex data patterns. Thus, one can use the model to generate a number of data sets by setting different parameters and label the data sets for training the neural networks. Once the network is trained, people can feed the empirical data to obtain estimation of the parameters. Again, to obtain accurate parameter estimation, one needs to generate as many simulation as possible to cover the unknown parameter space. So, I am not ganna apply it here but throw out this proposal and leave it for future exercises.\n\n### Summary statistics\nBoth methods mentioned above ask for summary statistics to measure the similarity between the simulated data and the empirical data. Here, I present one summary statistic that circumvents the obstacle of the difference between the real population size and the simulation limit. The summary statistic is defined by a vector of the ratios of the newly increasing number of the infected cases and the number of the infected cases on the previous day, $ip = (ip(t_0),ip(t_1),\\cdots,ip(t_{end}-1))$, in which the elements yielding:\n\\begin{align}\nip_{t} = \\frac{N_I(t+1)-N_I(t)}{N_I(t)}.\n\\end{align}\nIn such a way, at the early stage of the simulation when the grid size is relatively large enough so that it doesn't limit the development of the pandemic the growth pattern of the infected cases is comparable to the reality.

As mentioned above, one can implement immune system in the model to see whether herd immunity is achieved and to what extent it helps stop virus spread. In addition, whether wearing masks can help prevent virus spread can be implemented by adding a probability to get infected when meeting an infected individual.
