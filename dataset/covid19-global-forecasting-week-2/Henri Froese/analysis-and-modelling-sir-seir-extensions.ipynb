Thus, it can be thought of as the **expected amount of people an infected person infects per day** (or any other timestep, I'll use days here). Example: Let the probability of an infected person to infect a healthy/susceptible person be $5 \\%$ and the average number of people a person is in contact with per day be $6$. Then, $\\beta = 0.05 \\cdot 6 = 0.3$, that is, an infected person infects $0.3$ people per day on average.\n\n\nNow one can see that the **number of days than an infected person can spread the disease** is extremely important. Let $D$ be that number. Then, the number of people an infected person infects on average is $=$ **expected amount of people an infected person infects per day $\\cdot $ number of days the person can spread the disease**, and that's exactly $\\beta \\cdot D$. This is the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) $R_{0}$. Continuing the example from above: let $D = 10$, then $R_{0} = \\beta \\cdot D = 0.3 \\cdot 10 = 3$. That means that on average, each infected person infects $3$ others.\n\nNow the model below does not use $D$ but $\\gamma$, and that's just $= \\frac{1}{D}$ (Thus, $R_{0} = \\beta \\cdot D = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$ and $\\beta = R_{0} \\cdot \\gamma$)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.integrate import odeint # a lot of the code for SIR from https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The SIR model differential equations.\ndef deriv(y, t, N, beta, gamma):\n    S, I, R = y\n    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N\n    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I\n    dRdt = gamma * I\n    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We now want to add *cumulative* Deaths $X$ to the model: $X(t) = \\textit{number of deaths from day 0 to day t}$ for $t\\geq 14$, else $0$. \n\nRecursively, the number of cumulative deaths on day $t$ is equal to the number of cumulative deaths on day $t-1$ (that's $=X(t-1)$) plus the number of newly infected 13 days prior multiplied with the case fatality rate $\\alpha$ (alpha) (I chose 13 days as that is reported as the average time from infection until death in [this study](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320_article)).\n\nNow, the number of newly infected 13 days prior (that's the people who can die on day $t$) is equal to the number of infected 14 days prior multiplied with the expected amount of people an infected person infects per day (that's $\\beta$).
