This is because the impact coding (or the base models in superlearning) are relatively complex, high-degree-of-freedom models masquerading as low-degree-of-freedom single variables. As such, they may not be handled appropriately by downstream machine learning algorithms. In the case of impact-coded, high-cardinality categorical variables, the resulting impact coding may memorize patterns in the training data, making the variable appear more statistically significant than it really is to downstream modeling algorithms.* [p.13](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09477)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4e11ee0fd26fb9156c70693fbcc93429c75225c5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"(train.groupby('breed1').size() / len(train)).nlargest(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"01834d359bb50d25ae34add8e3a0c7f94ee97b58"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"~~E.g. more than half of pets in **train** were of either 307-th or 266-th breed, which means  that for majority of **breed1** values we'll have only a handful of observations to estimate the mean.
