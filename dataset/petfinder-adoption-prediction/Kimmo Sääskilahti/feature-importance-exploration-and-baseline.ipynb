Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details. \nThis is a Kernels-only competition. At the end of the competition, test data will be replaced in their entirety with new data of approximately the same size, and your kernels will be rerun on the new data.\n\n### File descriptions\n- train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set\n- test.csv - Tabular/text data for the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format\n- breed_labels.csv - Contains Type, and BreedName for each BreedID. Type 1 is dog, 2 is cat.\n- color_labels.csv - Contains ColorName for each ColorID\n- state_labels.csv - Contains StateName for each StateID\n\n### Data Fields\n- PetID - Unique hash ID of pet profile\n- AdoptionSpeed - Categorical speed of adoption. Lower is faster. This is the value to predict. See below section for more info.\n- Type - Type of animal (1 = Dog, 2 = Cat)\n- Name - Name of pet (Empty if not named)\n- Age - Age of pet when listed, in months\n- Breed1 - Primary breed of pet (Refer to BreedLabels dictionary)\n- Breed2 - Secondary breed of pet, if pet is of mixed breed (Refer to BreedLabels dictionary)\n- Gender - Gender of pet (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Mixed, if profile represents group of pets)\n- Color1 - Color 1 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- Color2 - Color 2 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- Color3 - Color 3 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- MaturitySize - Size at maturity (1 = Small, 2 = Medium, 3 = Large, 4 = Extra Large, 0 = Not Specified)\n- FurLength - Fur length (1 = Short, 2 = Medium, 3 = Long, 0 = Not Specified)\n- Vaccinated - Pet has been vaccinated (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Dewormed - Pet has been dewormed (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Sterilized - Pet has been spayed / neutered (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Health - Health Condition (1 = Healthy, 2 = Minor Injury, 3 = Serious Injury, 0 = Not Specified)\n- Quantity - Number of pets represented in profile\n- Fee - Adoption fee (0 = Free)\n- State - State location in Malaysia (Refer to StateLabels dictionary)\n- RescuerID - Unique hash ID of rescuer\n- VideoAmt - Total uploaded videos for this pet\n- PhotoAmt - Total uploaded photos for this pet\n- Description - Profile write-up for this pet. The primary language used is English, with some in Malay or Chinese.\n- AdoptionSpeed Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: \n    0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n    1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n    2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n    3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. \n    4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n\n### Images\n\nFor pets that have photos, they will be named in the format of PetID-ImageNumber.jpg. Image 1 is the profile (default) photo set for the pet. For privacy purposes, faces, phone numbers and emails have been masked.\n\n### Image Metadata\nWe have run the images through Google's Vision API, providing analysis on Face Annotation, Label Annotation, Text Annotation and Image Properties. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your image analysis.\n\nFile name format is PetID-ImageNumber.json.\n\nSome properties will not exist in JSON file if not present, i.e. Face Annotation. Text Annotation has been simplified to just 1 entry of the entire text description (instead of the detailed JSON result broken down by individual characters and words). Phone numbers and emails are already anonymized in Text Annotation.\n\nGoogle Vision API reference: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/annotate\n\n### Sentiment Data\nWe have run each pet profile's description through Google's Natural Language API, providing analysis on sentiment and key entities. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your pet description analysis. There are some descriptions that the API could not analyze. As such, there are fewer sentiment files than there are rows in the dataset.\n\nFile name format is PetID.json.\n\nGoogle Natural Language API reference: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics\n\nWhat will change in the 2nd stage of the competition?\nIn the second stage of the competition, we will re-run your selected Kernels. The following files will be swapped with new data:\n\ntest.zip including test.csv and sample_submission.csv\ntest_images.zip\ntest_metadata.zip\ntest_sentiment.zip\n\nIn stage 2, all data will be replaced with approximately the same amount of different data. The stage 1 test data will not be available when kernels are rerun in stage 2.\n</i>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Preprocessing"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### What we'll do here  for each column\n- `PetId`: Drop\n- `Type`: One-hot encode into `Type_Cat` field, drop `Type_Dog`\n- `Name`: Create a field for if name exists or not, drop *Name* column\n- `Age`: Leave as-is\n- `Breed1`: Keep `N` most frequent categories, one-hot encode rest\n- `Breed2`: Keep `N` most frequent categories, one-hot encode rest\n- `Gender`: One-hot encode\n- `Color1`, `Color2`, `Color3`: One-hot encode all of them\n- `MaturitySize`: Leave as-is\n- `FurLength`: One-hot encode (should account for zero?)\n- `Vaccinated`: One-hot encode (should account for 3?)\n- `Dewormed`: One-hot encode (should account for 3?)\n- `Sterilized`: One-hot encode (should account for 3?)\n- `Health`: One-hot encode, accounting for 0 (not specified)\n- `Quantity`: Leave as is\n- `Fee`: Leave as is\n- `State`: Keep `N` most frequent categories, one-hot encode\n- `VideoAmt`, `PhotosAmt`: Leave as is\n- `Description`: Leave as is"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Quick look at the distributions"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"train_df.hist(figsize=(20, 10))\nplt.tight_layout()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Define transformers\nWe'll use [scikit-learn pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) to define our data preprocessing transforms.
