Not only because it undermines the legitimacy of Kaggle competitions in general, but also because I wasted quite a lot of time investigating their solution and porting it to production only to find out that it is not legitimate.\n\nIt is still an opportunity to learn though.\nFirstly, it would probably be good to only upload external data that is actually used in your solution. In this case, the entire .csv file could have been omitted because all the information is captured in the file structure anyway. I'm looking forward to discussion on this though, since it is obviously not the root cause of the problem.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly: __Everyone who wins money from a competition should be required to open-source their solution__. I am not the first one to say this and I have no idea why it is still not the case. I understand that competition sponsors should be able to opt-out of this for privacy reasons (but then again, why host a Kaggle competition in the first place if that's the case?), but it should definitely be the default.\n\nI would even go as far as automatically publicizing all submitted solutions after the competition.
