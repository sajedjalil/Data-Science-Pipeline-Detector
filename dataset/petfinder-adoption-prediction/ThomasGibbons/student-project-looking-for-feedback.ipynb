Lower is faster. This is the value to predict. See below section for more info.\n- Type - Type of animal (1 = Dog, 2 = Cat)\n- Name - Name of pet (Empty if not named)\n- Age - Age of pet when listed, in months\n- Breed1 - Primary breed of pet (Refer to BreedLabels dictionary)\n- Breed2 - Secondary breed of pet, if pet is of mixed breed (Refer to BreedLabels dictionary)\n- Gender - Gender of pet (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Mixed, if profile represents group of pets)\n- Color1 - Color 1 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- Color2 - Color 2 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- Color3 - Color 3 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)\n- MaturitySize - Size at maturity (1 = Small, 2 = Medium, 3 = Large, 4 = Extra Large, 0 = Not Specified)\n- FurLength - Fur length (1 = Short, 2 = Medium, 3 = Long, 0 = Not Specified)\n- Vaccinated - Pet has been vaccinated (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Dewormed - Pet has been dewormed (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Sterilized - Pet has been spayed / neutered (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n- Health - Health Condition (1 = Healthy, 2 = Minor Injury, 3 = Serious Injury, 0 = Not Specified)\n- Quantity - Number of pets represented in profile\n- Fee - Adoption fee (0 = Free)\n- State - State location in Malaysia (Refer to StateLabels dictionary)\n- RescuerID - Unique hash ID of rescuer\n- VideoAmt - Total uploaded videos for this pet\n- PhotoAmt - Total uploaded photos for this pet\n- Description - Profile write-up for this pet. The primary language used is English, with some in Malay or Chinese.\n### AdoptionSpeed\nContestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: \n- 0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n- 1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n- 2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n- 3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. \n- 4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n\n### File descriptions\n- train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set\n- train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set\n- test.csv - Tabular/text data for the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format\n- breed_labels.csv - Contains Type, and BreedName for each BreedID. Type 1 is dog, 2 is cat.\n- color_labels.csv - Contains ColorName for each ColorID\n- state_labels.csv - Contains StateName for each StateID"},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"mEuPVnRDdGpu","_uuid":"85ee8e66f6ed8a62f2fa6ced7938e5b74bf1ce4c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 1:  Set up Pet Data\n\n"},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"YZ1dW8lJvScd","_uuid":"7a123a4c44781034ff65912849a88487da66f222"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set up the Input and output\n\n- Training data: Information on 14,993 pets up for adoption\n- Submission data: Information on 3,948 pets where we need to predict adoption time\n\n### NOTE: This dataset is somewhat large and loading it may take a minute or two \n"},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"Z_gd5XuZvScg","outputId":"5be789e3-8ac7-49e1-f096-47722c9add04","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"bec3679e1fc80e4224b387ee2e4513785668cd56"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read data from the actual Kaggle download files stored in a raw file in GitHub\ngithub_folder = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIS3115-Machine-Learning-Scholastica/CIS3115ML-Units7and8/master/petfinder-adoption/'\nkaggle_folder = '../input/'\n\ndata_folder = github_folder\n# Uncomment the next line to switch from using the github files to the kaggle files for a submission\n#data_folder = kaggle_folder\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'train/train.csv')\nsubmit = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'test/test.csv')\n\nsample_submission = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'test/sample_submission.csv')\nlabels_breed = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'breed_labels.csv')\nlabels_color = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'color_labels.csv')\nlabels_state = pd.read_csv(data_folder + 'state_labels.csv')\n\nprint (\"training data shape: \" ,train.shape)\nprint (\"submission data shape: : \" ,submit.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Rx9hBWGZihAo","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"0c3f2fc185486359a812c8a8dfb663d28e39decc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"3ZwZyUXT9eSg","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0771223d-5454-4108-a679-032e219a0d59","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":572},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"8f481c3d63a3076d27fe263ea4f94d1e504c41d3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"OUDwOkl9PZde","colab_type":"text","_uuid":"80cb9b348ea43e2ead3774fa568a9927185cc356"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Task 2: Select features\n\nSelect which pet features to include in the training data.
