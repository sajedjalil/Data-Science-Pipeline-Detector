Now a few days have passed and I am beginning to think that we might not be working with categorical data at all.\n\nLet's have a look at the data again. Below you can see that:\n- There are 50 features, which is more than in previous TPS Challenges according to [this disucssion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-may-2021/discussion/236128)\n- The data is **sparse**, which means that we mostly have the value zero\n- There are no missing values\n- Most features are positive integers. Some can also be negative.\n\nHm... where have we seen this type of data before? This seems oddly similar to something you might have seen previously in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** problems. The data almost looks like it is a **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **Document Term Matrix (DTM)** representation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\n\n# Visualizations\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})\n\n# Encoders\nimport category_encoders as ce\n\n# Model Training\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss, make_scorer\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-may-2021/train.csv\")\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-may-2021/test.csv\")\n\n# Drop id column\n#train_df.drop('id', axis=1, inplace=True)\n#test_df.drop('id', axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n# Only for visualization purposes\ntemp = train_df.copy()\ntemp.columns = list(['id']) + list([f\"f{c}\" for c in range(50)]) + list(['target'])\nfeature_cols = temp.columns[temp.columns.str.startswith('f')]\n\ndisplay(temp[feature_cols].head(10).style.background_gradient(cmap='Greens_r', vmin=-1, vmax=1))\ndel(temp)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bag of Words / Document Term Matrix\n\nThe BoW or DTM is a way to represent text in a numerical way. Since this data is based on eCommerce listings, I will try to explain it with some eCommerce related examples:\nLet's say you have two product reviews:\n> \"This book was a great read.\" - Review 1\n\n> \"I read this book in a day. Easy read.\" - Review 2\n\nNow you take all unique words from both reviews and make them as features: {'this', 'book', 'was', 'great', 'read', 'i', 'in', 'a', 'day', 'easy'}. And then you assign the number of times this word appears in the review to the feature as follows:\n\n|          | this | book | was | great |read | i | in | a | day |easy |\n|:--------:|------|------|-----|-------|-------|---|----|---|-----|-----|\n| Review 1 | 1    | 1    | 1   | 1     |  1 |0 | 0  | 0 | 0   |0   |\n| Review 2 | 1    | 1    | 0   | 0     | 2 | 1 | 1  | 1 | 1   |1   |\n\nNow this looks quite similar to what we have above. \n\nThis is just a **wild guess but maybe we are trying to classify an eCommerce product given its product reviews**. For example, maybe we are trying to classify whether a book is a thriller, drama, novel or non-fiction based on its reviews. Of course this could be completely wrong but let's try this hypothesis.\n\nSome notes of precaution:\n* One point that does not fit this hypothesis fully at the moment is that we also have some features with negative values. BoW usually do not have negative values (how can a word appear negative times in a text?\"). \n* As [@melanie7744](https://www.kaggle.com/melanie7744) has mentioned in the comments, 50 features for BoW seems a little bit too small for a vocabulary.\n* Some \"words\" have a high frequency in the \"sentences\". For example, feature_43 is appearing 21 times in the first sample. I cannot imagine what kind of \"text\" that would be.\n\n**If you have an idea how this could relate to the idea, please share it!**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe have seen many great notebooks in this challenge sofar showcasing dimensionality reductions for the features using UMAP and t-SNE.
