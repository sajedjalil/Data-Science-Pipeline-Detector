I decided to make some crazy experiment ... \n\n\n#### I asked myself. Is it possible to build a good model on the TPS-05 data at all? I decided to simplify the issue to exclude the influence of imbalanced data between classes ans see how out-of-the LightGBM ... box works on TPS-05 data. This is how a new idea was born.\n\n#### What if I only did a classification of two classes, eg Class_1 and Class_4. Both have the same amount of data, so the problem of the lack of balance is eliminated. In addition, the classifier should separate both classes well - it's a only 2 classes instead of 4, there is no problem of unbalance etc.\n\n#### I decided to conduct set of experiments. See what came out. \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n  <strong>In this series my TPS-05 notebooks:</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li><a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/remekkinas/shap-lgbm-looking-for-best-features\">SHAP + LGBM - looking for best features</a></li>\n        <li><a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/remekkinas/tps-5-weighted-training-xgb-rf-lr-smote\">Weighted training - XGB, RF, LR, ...
