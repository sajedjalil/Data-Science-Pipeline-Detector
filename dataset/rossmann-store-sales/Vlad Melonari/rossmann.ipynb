Not because we have a Rossmann store near our house. It's because, I am also dealing in my daily job-life with time series datasets, understanding and making predictions from it.  \n\nI will go trough the following steps:\n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n\n* Problem definition (what do we want to solve)\n* Variable Identification (what data do we have)\n* Univariate Analysis (understanding each field in the dataset)\n* Multivariate Analysis (understanding the interactions between different fields and target)\n* Missig values treatment (machine learning algorythems hates fields with missing data)\n* Outlier treatment\n* Variable transformation / creation\n\n**Predictive Modeling**\n* SARIMAX\n* Prophet\n* Random Forest Regression\n* XGBoost\n\nNow get prepared, by sitting on your favorite chair in a room with a glass Wine or Cola, because this can be a long read."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6110ac5d677f8647d76f8c974a6859853ba68e73"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem definition\n\nWe have the following informations from rossmann in two different tables:\n\n* **Id**: An Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set\n* **Store**: A unique Id for each store\n* **Sales**: The turnover on a given day (our target variable)\n* **Customers**: The number of customers on a given day\n* **Open**: open: 0 = the store is closed , 1 = the store is open\n* **StateHoliday**: Indicates a state holiday. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None\n* **SchoolHoliday**: Store on this Date was affected or not by the closure of public schools\n* **StoreType**: 4 different stores:a,b,c,d\n* **Assortment**: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended\n* **CompetitionDistance**: Distance in meters to the nearest competitor store\n* **CompetitionOpenSince**[Month/Year]: gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened\n* **Promo**: Promo or not on that day\n* **Promo2**: Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating\n* **Promo2Since**[Year/Week]: describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2\n* **PromoInterval**: describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. \"Feb,May,Aug,Nov\" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store\n\nWith all this information we have to predict the sales for the next 6 weeks.
