However, make sure to pick visualizations, scales and colors that are suited for your particular question.\n\n**Look at the Kernels and Forums on Kaggle!** Kaggle is a platform for learning and sharing ideas in the domain of data mining, data processing and machine learning. Many users share their work and ideas, so please use these resources. Also don't be shy to post questions and share your approaches and ideas in the Forum if you are not in the Top 10%. It's all about learning!\n\n**Always cite (link) your sources!** Many of the ideas that you implement are not yours, and others would love to know where you took them from.\n\nYou can also use our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ViennaKaggle/allstate-claims-severity) to discuss your approach.
