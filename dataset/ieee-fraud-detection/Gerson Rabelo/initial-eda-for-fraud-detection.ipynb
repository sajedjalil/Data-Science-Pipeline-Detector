However, in the next topic we will see in a simplified way how a Supervised Machine Learning works and how it could be applied in identifying fraudulent transactions.\n\nThe data is broken into two files **Identity** and **Transaction**, which are joined by TransactionID. Below, the categorical variables we will use in our Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n**Categorical Features - Transaction** \n- ProductCD\n- card1 - card6\n- addr1, addr2\n- P_emaildomain\n- R_emaildomain\n- M1 - M9\n\n**Categorical Features - Identity**\n- DeviceType\n- DeviceInfo\n- id_12 - id_38","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.023064,"end_time":"2021-10-01T18:11:14.145772","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-10-01T18:11:14.122708","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.3 Supervised Machine Learning applied to Fraud Detection","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.023513,"end_time":"2021-10-01T18:11:14.192302","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-10-01T18:11:14.168789","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are several ways of represent a machine learning.

The accuracy is related in  mostly because to the understanding, selecting and preparation of data.\n\nHere’s a simple explanation of why accuracy is so important in a fraud detection.
