There are different types of payment card frauds, \nPayment card fraud is a serious and long-term threat to society with a huge economic impact. Frauds are increasing dramatically with the progression of modern technology and global communication. As a result, fighting fraud has become an important issue to be explored.\n\nBuilding an efficient Machine Learning model to dynamically flag a fraudulent transaction requires the following steps\n1. Acquiring data\n2. Data Preprocessing.\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis.\n4. Principal Component Analysis.\n5. Model building and training.\n\n**Acquiring data**\nThe data comes from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions. It comes under 2 categories which has Transaction ID as the common feature between them.\n          Transaction - This dataset holds the data for all the real time transactions that were recorded\n          Identity -        Variables in this table are identity information – network connection         \t         information  (IP, ISP, Proxy, etc) and digital signature (UA/browser/os/version, \t         etc) associated with transactions\n\n**Data Preprocessing.**\nThe data is cleansed by handling the missing values and treating outliers.\n\n**Missing Value:**\n\nThe dataset has a huge proportion of null values, I have handled the missing values using two approaches\n1. Dropping columns that has more than 75% of null values.\n2. Imputing the null values with appropriate measures of central tendency.\n\nNote:  I made required analysis to impute the missing values for by predicting the values using suitable Machine Learning algorithms. But my observations showed all the required columns which could be used to predict and impute also had null values. So I opted for imputing by measures of central tendency. \n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis.**\n\nDetailed EDA with code and explanation can be found below.\n\n**Principal Component Analysis.**\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. This helps in reducing the complexity and helps the model to perform with better performance.  The entire process of model building has been taken care with different trial and error basis. The approaches are as follows\n\n1. Without Outlier treatment and with imbalanced data\n2. Without Outlier treatment and with balanced data (By performing Upsampling)\n3. With Outlier treatment and with imbalanced data\n4. With Outlier treatment and with balanced data (By performing Upsampling).\n\nEach of these approaches has its own impact on the number of principal components required. \nWithout Outlier treatment and with imbalanced data\nNumber of columns retained  for 99% of info retained- 143.\nWithout Outlier treatment and with balanced data (By performing Upsampling)\nNumber of columns retained  for 99% of info retained- 142\nWith Outlier treatment and with imbalanced data\nNumber of columns retained  for 99% of info retained- 98\nWith Outlier treatment and with balanced data (By performing Upsampling)\nNumber of columns retained  for 99% of info retained- 99\n\n**Model building and training.**\n\nModels considered to use\n\nRandom Forest - Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. In two dimensional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.\n\n\nXGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting is similar to gradient boosting framework but more efficient. It  has both linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. So, what makes it fast is its capacity to do parallel computation on a single machine.\n\n\nLight GBM - LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages: Faster training speed and higher efficiency; lower memory usage; better accuracy; support of parallel and GPU learning; capable of handling large-scale data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"References
