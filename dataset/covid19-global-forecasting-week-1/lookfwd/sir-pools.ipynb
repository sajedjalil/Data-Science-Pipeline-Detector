I assume that the SEIR model isn't applicable due to any intervention being too late for a fast-spreading virus like this, especially in places with dense populations.\n\nAfter playing with the data provided in [COVID19 Global Forecasting (Week 1)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1/) (and everything else online or media) a bit, one thing becomes clear. They have nothing to do with epidemiology. They reflect sociopolitical characteristics of a country/state and, more specifically, the reactivity and attitude towards testing.\n\n\n## Notes on the testing methods\n\nThe testing method used (PCR tests) means that what we measure could potentially be a proxy for the number of people infected during the last 3 weeks, i.e the growth (with lag). It's not how many people have been infected and recovered. Antibody or serology tests would measure that, and by using them, we could go back to normality faster... but those will arrive too late. Way earlier, China will have experimentally shown that it's safe to go back to normal as soon as your number of newly infected per day is close to zero.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F197482%2F429e0fdd7f1ce86eba882857ac7a735e%2Fcovid-summary.png?generation=1585072438685236&alt=media)\n\n## Discussion/Conclussions\n\nIn the next few weeks we will see if the estimations provides by the \"naive\" SIR model based on the existing data are by any means accurate. I would love to project the morality model back to the positive cases model with some sociological-style backpropagation. This should be possible based on the following experiential observations:\n\nMy view, as a person living in NYC, about this virus, is that by the time governments react to media pressure, to lockdown or even test, it's too late. In dense areas, everyone susceptible has already amble opportunities to be infected. Especially for a virus with 5-14 days lag between infections and symptoms, a period during which hosts spread it all over on subway, the conditions are hopeless. Active populations have already been exposed, mostly asymptomatic and recovered. Sensitive/older populations are more self-isolated/careful in affluent societies (maybe this isn't the case in North Italy). As the virus finishes exploring the active population, it starts penetrating the more isolated clusters. At this point in time, the first fatalities happen. Then testing starts. Then the media and the lockdown. Lockdown seems overly effective because it coincides with the tail of this disease's spread. It also helps slow down the virus exploring the long-tail of sensitive population, and we should all contribute by doing it, but we shouldn't assume that it *causes* the end of the outbreak. It's possible they've both common cause. If lockdowns caused the end of the outbreak, then the recovered system would be unstable and as soon as people were back to normal (see China), there would be repeated outbreaks. More effective response is, if the lockdown starts when the first e.g. China cases are confirmed. Randomized testing should also start at that point and potentially mandoratory at airports. If states has access to any tests, they should not wait to develop \"their own\" just to kill time in denial. I think more people are now able to understand those subtle differences.\n\nSmart politicians will test a lot because it will make their condition look worse. It helps them demand more resources. At the same time, they will have a low rate of fatalities due to large denominator. They can take credit for managing well a disproportionally major crisis - in contrast to people who didn't test.\n\nWe were lucky this time. We, Westerners, have woken up to the potential of a pandemic. I'm sure we will give further resources for prevention. Additionally, we will be more open-minded, helping politicians to have more direct responses. We will also require from politicians to be more responsible in their messages and reactions.\n\n## Acknowledgments/Credits\n\n* Thanks [Apostolos Panagiotopoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apostolos-panagiotopoulos-4a09b615/) for all the inspiring discussions\n* Thanks [Sofia Zafeiri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiazafeiri/) for bringing my attention to this Kaggle competition\n* Thanks [Constantina Theofanopoulou](https://theofanopoulou.wixsite.com/constantina) and [Peter Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-martin-375091a9/) for helping me clarify some of the narative.\n\nThe following two were very useful and I copy-pasted a few things from these:\n\n* [COVID Global Forecast: SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/saga21/covid-global-forecast-sir-model/)\n* [SEIR Model with intervention](https://www.kaggle.com/anjum48/seir-model-with-intervention/)\n\nDatasets\n\n* `kaggle competitions download -c covid19-global-forecasting-week-1`\n* `kaggle datasets download lookfwd/covid19highestcitypopulationdensity`\n* `kaggle datasets download anjum48/covid19-population-data`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
