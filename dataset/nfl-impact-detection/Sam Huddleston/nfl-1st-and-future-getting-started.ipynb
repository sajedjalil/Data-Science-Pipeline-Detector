However, there are also helmets (players) that appear in the videos that are not participating in the play.  These players are identified with the labels V00 (non-participant on the visiting team) or H00 (non-participant on the home team).  In rare cases that a player cannot be uniquely identified that is participating in the play (for example when only the helmet is visible in a pile-up), the appropriate generic V00 or H00 label is applied to that helmet bounding box. \n\nThe Sideline and Endzone views have been time-synced such that the snap occurs 10 frames into the video.
