Use the old test file for your submission. This is necessary for better cross validation if you are going to use this kernel. </s> Nevermind... brainfart, there are stage_2_test files.\n  \n*Since the relased test ID's and former training ID's conflict with each other, I've just reset the index on final training DataFrame to make them unique and cause less confusion.
