We want to encourage our model to find parts of the weight space that are both accurate and stable. Therefore, from time to time we increase the learning rate (this is the 'restarts' in 'SGDR'), which will force the model to jump to a different part of the weight space if the current area is \"spikey\". Here's a picture of how that might look if we reset the learning rates 3 times (in this paper they call it a \"cyclic LR schedule\"):\n\n<img src=\"images/sgdr.png\" width=\"80%\">\n(From the paper [Snapshot Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00109)).\n\nThe number of epochs between resetting the learning rate is set by `cycle_len`, and the number of times this happens is refered to as the *number of cycles*, and is what we're actually passing as the 2nd parameter to `fit()`.
