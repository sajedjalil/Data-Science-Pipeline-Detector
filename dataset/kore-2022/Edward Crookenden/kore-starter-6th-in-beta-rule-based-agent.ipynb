The agent is based on the provided starter bot (https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/kore_fleets/kore_fleets.py). This notebook is aimed to help people get started in the competetion and potentially provide some initial insights into the game! It is still a work in progress so please let me know if you spot any bugs or have any code improvements to recommend. If you find it useful give it a thumbs up 🤙\n\nAnother helpful reference could be @paradite's really insightful youtube streama going though a rule based agenta and a DQN agent :) (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC965IqGwTEYCA0SNM4B1UBQ/videos?view=2&live_view=503)\n\n\n\n<div align = 'center'><img src= \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YGJ77qN9KiwctZgfqV8Bf3hNo0rZvcFaPKDTkvtS6kVbtwyCS80Pm6dpXzJCCLZE1Q\" alt =\"H & M\" style='width: 3000px;height 1000px'>\n    \n### Contents:\n\n[Helpers 🤝](#first-bullet)\n This consists of extra helper functions. This includes simple functions to calculate the shortest flight path between two points and the total number of ships for a given player. It also provides functions to calculate the maximum length of a flight plan given a fleet size (and vice versa) as well as a function to calulate the collection rate for a given fleet size. Examples of these calculations can be found in the kore rules (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/overview/kore-rules) but these functions provide precise calculations for all fleet sizes. \n    \nThe simple agent works by checking if it should take the following actions. The priority of these actions are ordered as shown below. This is executed for each shipyard independently.\n    \n[Defend 🛡](#second-bullet) If a large enemy fleet is near a shipyard the main objective is to defend. This is done by building more ships if possible.\n  \n[Attack 🧨](#third-bullet) If a shipyard has enough ships to attack a nearby enemy shipyard it should attack or start building more ships to attack.\n    \n[Build 🧱](#fourth-bullet) If the player has enough Kore and the shipyards `spawn maximum` is large enough the shipyard should expand. This expansion is to a nearby location maximising surrounding kore but away from enemy shipyards.\n\n[Mine ⛏](#fith-bullet) The agent uses 3 mining tactics..\n    \n1. A simple 'circle'. This will have a flight path of length 7 (e.g. `\"N5E5W5S\"`) requiring a fleet size of 21.\n    \n2. A 'rectangle'. This is similar as above but has a gap of 0 on two sides. This allows the flight path and, as a result, the fleet size to be much smaller. For example the flight path `\"NE5WS\"` (length 5) only requires a fleet size of 8.\n    \n3. The final route is an 'L' shape (I first saw this in the beta by @robga). This involves leaving the shipyard in an L shape and coming back along the same route. An example fligth path is `\"N6E6W6S\"` which requires a fleet size of 21.\n    \nThe agent looks at all possible mining routes and calculates which path mines the most kore per ship in the fleet.\n    \n[Spawn Ships 🚀](#sixth-bullet) If the shipyard has enough kore it will spawn the maximum number of ships.\n   \n[Replay and submission 🎥](#seventh-bullet) This shows the agent vs a baseline bot.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-11T22:19:28.711912Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-11T22:19:28.712339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-11T22:19:28.74379Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-11T22:19:28.712237Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-11T22:19:28.742459Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###
