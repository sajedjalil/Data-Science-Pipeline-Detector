In this case, the BB's are square and their lines fall in the X and Y planes. This makes it easier to calculate their distances.\n- The basic formula is -> **mm = pixel_distance * pixel_spacing**\n\nThere are various Pixel Spacing tags that can exist. Most commonly in X-Ray, we refer to the ImagerPixelSpacing tag (x0018,x1164) for measurements. This is the calibrated amount that each pixel on the receptor is multiplied by to give a real world measurement.\n\n- Pixel Spacing tags have two values seperated with a slash character .. with one value for the X plane and one for the Y plane.\n- These values are almost always the same, but they do not have to be. Some systems create images with non-square pixels (yes .. I know that seems odd, but pixels can be non-square!).\n- DICOM Pixel Spacing Reference: http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_10.7.html\n\nOf the 6443 images in the train set, 5936 images have the ImagerPixelSpacing tag present.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pydicom\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os\nfrom os import listdir\nfrom os.path import isfile, join\nimport json\nfrom pydicom.pixel_data_handlers.util import apply_voi_lut","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-22T13:54:50.456753Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-22T13:54:50.457175Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.721237Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-22T13:54:50.457091Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.720003Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the image data\nbase_path = \"/kaggle/input/siim-covid19-detection/\"\nimages_df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(base_path,\"train_image_level.csv\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.725834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.726494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.789502Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.726454Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.788422Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Function to get the first file in a study directory by study_id\ndef get_image_by_study_id(study_id):\n    study_path = base_path + \"train/\" + study_id + \"/\"\n    images = []\n    for subdir, dirs, files in os.walk(study_path):\n        for file in files:\n            images.append(os.path.join(subdir, file))\n            \n    return images","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.791195Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.791547Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.798419Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.791517Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.79733Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Function to get the BB data from the images DF\ndef get_boxes(image_id):\n    image = image_id.replace('.dcm','_image')\n    ti = images_df[images_df['id'] == image]\n    bx = [[],[]]\n    bx[0] = [0,0,0,0,\"\"]\n    bx[1] = [0,0,0,0,\"\"]\n    \n    if str(ti['boxes'].values[0]) != \"nan\":\n        box = str(ti['boxes'].values[0]).replace(\"'\",\"\\\"\")\n        boxes = json.loads(box)\n        lab = ti['label'].values[0].split(\" \")\n        i = 0\n        for b in boxes:\n            bx[i] = [str(b['x']), str(b['y']), str(b['width']),str(b['height']),str(lab[0])]\n            i = i+1\n    return bx","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.800256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.800593Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.81206Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.800561Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.810744Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Pick a random study in the train set and get image(s) from it\nstudy_id = \"00086460a852\"\nimages = get_image_by_study_id(study_id)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.813807Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.814263Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.840345Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.814228Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-22T13:54:51.839265Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"line_color = 'red'\ntext_color = 'yellow'\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\n\n# Iterate through the file list\nfor img_file in images:\n    \n    #
