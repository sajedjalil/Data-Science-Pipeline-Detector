Here we add a convolutional model instead, which is slightly less straightforward than the typical Pong-solving networks. We'll also develop the wrappers required to use the observations from the SMM version of the GFootball environment.\n\nTo keep this notebook short and focused, the example training the mode use my package [reinforcement-learning-keras package](https://github.com/garethjns/reinforcement-learning-keras). Alternatively, code in [Deep Q-learner starter code](https://www.kaggle.com/garethjns/deep-q-learner-starter-code) can be used instead, without requiring any additional packages. In either case, the model needs to be saved as a keras model to be used in a submission. This conversion process is shown below, and can be run locally by following the (again, WIP) structure and examples here https://github.com/garethjns/kaggle-football ."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Set up"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# GFootball environment.\n!pip install kaggle_environments\n!apt-get update -y\n!apt-get install -y libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev\n!git clone -b v2.3 https://github.com/google-research/football.git\n!mkdir -p football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib\n!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gfootball/prebuilt_gameplayfootball_v2.3.so -O football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib/prebuilt_gameplayfootball.so\n!cd football && GFOOTBALL_USE_PREBUILT_SO=1 pip3 install .\n\n# Some helper code\n!git clone https://github.com/garethjns/kaggle-football.git\n!pip install reinforcement_learning_keras==0.6.0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import collections\nfrom typing import Union, Callable, List, Tuple, Iterable, Any, Dict\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport gym\nimport gfootball\nimport glob \nimport imageio\nimport pathlib\nimport zlib\nimport pickle\nimport tempfile\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\nsns.set()\n\n# In TF > 2, training keras models in a loop with eager execution on causes memory leaks and terrible performance.\ntf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()\n\nsys.path.append(\"/kaggle/working/kaggle-football/\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Environment\n\n## SMM observation space\n\nThe \"GFootball-11_vs_11_kaggle-SMM-v0\" enviroment in GFootball uses the [SMMWrapper](https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/doc/observation.md) observation wrapper to return frames showing team positions, ball position, and current active player position."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_football.viz import generate_gif, plot_smm_obs\n\n\nsmm_env = gym.make(\"GFootball-11_vs_11_kaggle-SMM-v0\")\nprint(smm_env.reset().shape)\n\ngenerate_gif(smm_env, n_steps=500, expected_min=0, expected_max=255)\nImage(filename='smm_env_replay.gif', format='png')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These frames can be used by a convolutional neural network, but require pre-processing first.\n\n - Reshaping\n   - 2D convolutional layers typically expect input with the shape (None, x, y, c), where c is the colour channel and is 1 or 3.

It should be able to learn something in this environment but will probably require a lot of tweaking and significant training time. \n\nOne potential optimisation would be to reduce the inputs for the ball and active player, treating those as whole frames is expensive, and they could as well be represented by an array of (4,) ie. [x_last, y_last, x_now, y_now].\n\nThe submission still needs work too. It appears to intermittently time out during when running in the notebook enviroment, which forfeights the game.
