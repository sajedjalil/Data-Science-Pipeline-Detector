{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploring GFootball environment\n\nUpdate 13/10/2020\nI'm adding a section on running the enviroment using the Kaggle API. This is important for evulatuion, and validating the agent locally (with debugging).\n\n\n\nI'm new to the GFootball environment and these are my notes on it's usage and behaviour. I plan to try it out (and train) using the Gym API first as I have some familiarity with it, then move on to understanding how the Kaggle environment wrappers work. Hopefully this will be useful for anyone not familiar with the OpenAI Gym API.\n\nI'm also working on another couple of notebooks concurrently with this one:  \n - [Deep Q-learner start code](https://www.kaggle.com/garethjns/deep-q-learner-starter-code) - Building a deep Q-learner from scratch for the Simple115 version of this environment  \n - [Convolutional deep Q-learner](https://www.kaggle.com/garethjns/convolutional-deep-q-learner) - Upgrading the deep Q-learner to use a convolutional model with the SMM version of this environment  \n\nContents:\n  1. Setup  \n  2. Alternative setup\n  3. Gym API   \n    4. GFootball observation space and wrappers  \n    5. GFootball action space and wrappers  \n  4. Kaggle API\n    1. Debugging agents\n  6.

This returns an observation.\n\nenv.step() takes an action to apply to the environment, typically this comes from an Agent. In the above example it is just randomly sampled from the environment’s action space.\n\nIt then returns a few things:\n - new observations (which are typically passed to the agent on the next loop iteration)\n - any reward from the environment (can be negative)\n - a done flag indicating if the environment has reached a terminal state\n - \"info\" - a dict containing anything else, this isn't supposed to be used by the agent\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Registering and creating Gym enviroments"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Gym environments need to be registered in order to be created with gym.make(). 4 versions of multiple environments are automatically registered on import of the GFootball package (see https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/__init__.py).\n\nThe scenario relevant for this competition is (presumably) [11_vs_11_kaggle.py](https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/scenarios/11_vs_11_kaggle.py).
