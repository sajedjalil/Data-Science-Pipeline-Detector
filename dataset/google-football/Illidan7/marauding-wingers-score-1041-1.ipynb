I started with the sample submission, then tried to build out a rule based game strategy. I drew from my experience playing FIFA and this strategy is inspired by those I've played against who just run down the wing mindlessly and put in crosses. I find the cross-heavy gameplay particularly annoying. Not because it is particularly effective, but it just leads to a lot of throw ins and stoppages in play since the ball is concentrated close to the byline. Not fun to have a lot of stoppages and interruptions when you're playing FIFA\nAnyway, back to the bot. It is built to run down the wing and bang in crosses. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to code in first-time shots. I started a discussion on that [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-football/discussion/196035). \n\nThis bot does pretty well for being so simple. It reached a score of 1105 at one point, and now **stands at 1041.1 as of 11/09.** I wanted to add this write up so you might see the score different on this notebook when I put this out there.\n\nThere are still many other rule-based strategies that I had in mind. Like not to be sprinting all the time like this bot does, or have a better approach at finding open teammates for passing etc. But I want to move on to building out some algorithmic solutions and learn some new techniques. I don't have much experience with Reinforcement Learning and my aim is to build an RL solution that beats this benchmark I have set for myself before the competitions ends. \n\nLeave me any feedback/ questions in the comments and feel free to share some good resources! \n\nHere are some useful resources for ideas on the rule-based approach. If you see your ideas on this notebook and I haven't mentioned your notebook, let me know!\n\n1. https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/doc/observation.md#raw-observations\n2. https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/28e75806001c51f1fecbd5d3d8fe7b0aa83f33e5/kaggle_environments/envs/football/helpers.py\n3. https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-football/discussion/191804\n4. https://www.kaggle.com/piotrstanczyk/gfootball-template-bot\n5. https://www.kaggle.com/mlconsult/best-open-rules-bot-score-1020-7"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\n# Install:\n# Kaggle environments.\n!git clone https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments.git\n!cd kaggle-environments && pip install .\n\n# GFootball environment.\n!apt-get update -y\n!apt-get install -y libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev\n\n# Make sure that the Branch in git clone and in wget call matches !!\n!git clone -b v2.8 https://github.com/google-research/football.git\n!mkdir -p football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib\n\n!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gfootball/prebuilt_gameplayfootball_v2.8.so -O football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib/prebuilt_gameplayfootball.so\n!cd football && GFOOTBALL_USE_PREBUILT_SO=1 pip3 install .","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile submission.py\nfrom kaggle_environments.envs.football.helpers import *\nfrom random import randint\n\n\n# Function to calculate distance \ndef get_distance(pos1,pos2):\n    return (((pos1[0]-pos2[0])**2)+((pos1[1]-pos2[1])**2))**0.5\n\n# Function to cross ball from wing\ndef cross_ball():\n    pass\n\n# Movement directions\ndirections = [\n[Action.TopLeft, Action.Top, Action.TopRight],\n[Action.Left, Action.Idle, Action.Right],\n[Action.BottomLeft, Action.Bottom, Action.BottomRight]]\n\ndirsign = lambda x: 1 if abs(x) < 0.01 else (0 if x < 0 else 2)\n\n# Set game plan parameters\ngoalRange = 0.65\nwingRange = 0.21\n\n@human_readable_agent\ndef agent(obs):\n    \n    #
