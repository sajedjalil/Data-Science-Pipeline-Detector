I have spent my time this last week working on understanding the environment and working on a rules based bot to get a feel for how much success a rules based bot can have. \n\nThis competition brings back memories of my Artificial Intelligence for Robotics at Georgia Tech... that was an amazing class that was hard, but I loved every minute.\n\nI want to give credit to @eugenkeil (notebook baseline bot) and @raffaelemorganti (notebook rule-based way) that really helped me hit the ground running and gave me many many ideas for making a good rule based bot.\n\nThe major items in this bot that I contirbuted are a VERY CRUDE system (run_pass function) that determines where defenders are and tries to run around them or pass to open teammates nearby.  The system also runs to where the ball is going when it doesn't have the ball and then moves to ball when close - this helps the bots defense IMO and makes a big difference.\n\nI hope it helps and if so, please share ideas and code with others as that is how we all learn.  Also, if you find this useful and have an code you'd be willing to share to help me get a jumpstart on training my Deep RL with Pytorch I will gladly accept it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install:\n# Kaggle environments.\n!git clone https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments.git\n!cd kaggle-environments && pip install .\n\n# GFootball environment.\n!apt-get update -y\n!apt-get install -y libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev\n\n# Make sure that the Branch in git clone and in wget call matches !!\n!git clone -b v2.6 https://github.com/google-research/football.git\n!mkdir -p football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib\n\n!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gfootball/prebuilt_gameplayfootball_v2.6.so -O football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib/prebuilt_gameplayfootball.so\n!cd football && GFOOTBALL_USE_PREBUILT_SO=1 pip3 install .","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile submission.py\nfrom kaggle_environments.envs.football.helpers import *\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndirections = [\n[Action.TopLeft, Action.Top, Action.TopRight],\n[Action.Left, Action.Idle, Action.Right],\n[Action.BottomLeft, Action.Bottom, Action.BottomRight]]\n\ndirsign = lambda x: 1 if abs(x) < 0.01 else (0 if x < 0 else 2)\n\nenemyGoal = [1, 0]\nperfectRange = [[0.61, 1], [-0.2, 0.2]]\n\ndef inside(pos, area):\n    return area[0][0] <= pos[0] <= area[0][1] and area[1][0] <= pos[1] <= area[1][1]\n\ndef get_distance(pos1,pos2):\n    return ((pos1[0]-pos2[0])**2+(pos1[1]-pos2[1])**2)**0.5\n\ndef player_direction(obs):\n    controlled_player_pos = obs['left_team'][obs['active']]\n    controlled_player_dir = obs['left_team_direction'][obs['active']]\n    x = controlled_player_pos[0]\n    y = controlled_player_pos[1]\n    dx = controlled_player_dir[0]\n    dy = controlled_player_dir[1]\n    \n    if x <= dx:\n        return 0\n    if x > dx:\n        return 1\n\ndef run_pass(left_team,right_team,x,y):\n    ###Are there defenders dead ahead?\n    defenders=0\n    for i in range(len(right_team)):\n        if right_team[i][0] > x and y +.01 >= right_team[i][1] and right_team[i][1]>= y -
