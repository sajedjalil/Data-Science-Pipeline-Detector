{"cells":[{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is my copy of a notebook started by [Yegor Biryukov](https://www.kaggle.com/yegorbiryukov/gfootball-with-memory-patterns) with the deterministic script from [Raffaele Morganti](https://www.kaggle.com/raffaelemorganti/rule-based-way). My sincere gratitude to both of them for making my participation in this competition much easier.\n\nThe approach is rule-based and strictly human learning. :) I took the liberty of combining chunks of code from Yegor's notebook into one big chunk for easy execution. Here's the list of enhancements I made.\n\n* Defensive issues:\n1. Limit blind Action.Shot up field to goalie only. The reason for this is I found that trying to boot the ball upfield without looking at whether opponent players might be blocking is dangerous so I limit it to goalie who mostly has enough room in front of him to clear.\n2. For other players, I try to evade the chasing opponents before trying to pass while avoiding going into my own penalty box.\n3. Sliding is essential but doing it wildly can get your player sent off so I chose to slide only when the player is near both the ball and the opponent player for two steps. This is all trial-and-error.\n4. High ball overhead beyond our last defender leads to many goals so I handle this situation as a special case. The last defender does not chase the ball but chase the highest opponent player instead. This works reasonably well but not foolproof for the case of two-on-two and the ball is going to the second-highest attacker instead of the highest one. I try to fix it only to make it worse so I gave up.\n\n* Offensive issues:\n1. I notice that quick passing and shooting without taking possession of the ball is the way top players score so I mimic it by calculating whether the active player is going to be the first to the ball. If so, issue the pass or shot command before the ball arrives. This is not without a downside in that if the player turns out not to be first to the ball, he can stray too far from the opponent to impede him going for goal. Another sticky point is the fact that passing command is delayed. If the player turns the wrong direction after taking possession of the ball, i.e. facing toward our own goal, it can result in an own goal. So, I made quick passing and shooting sticky by repeating it. This is risky so I try to delay making this quick pass/shoot decision as late as possible before the ball reaches the player.\n2. When trying to dribble past defenders, I adjust the constant so we don't look at defenders that is a little bit far behind us. This improves the score quite a bit.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result. I think I achieve rank 31st only because I had many submissions with different tuning parameters. What I thought was a good change turn out not to be that good in the end. The randomness of game results results in misleading LB score makes tuning difficult. I wish I have implemented a local LB but it might not help much because of the lack of variety in agents."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# *The \"goal\" ;) of this notebook is to popularize, to the extent of my modest abilities, usage of functional programming and readable, scalable architectures.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explanation of The Architecture\n* In <code><b>agent</b></code> function data of the current environment is modified and <code><b>get_action_of_agent</b></code> function is called to get the action that will be returned.\n* In <code><b>get_action_of_agent</b></code> function list of memory patterns is provided by <code><b>find_patterns</b></code> function, then action of the first memory pattern in that list, whose constraints are met by current environment, is returned.\n* All Groups of Memory Patterns and all Memory Patterns are just functions that are taking the same arguments: <code><b>obs, player_x, player_y</b></code> and return a dictionary with at least two functions.\n* First function in that dictionary for both Groups of Memory Patterns and Memory Patterns is <code><b>environment_fits</b></code>, it returns True or False, in case constraints described in this function are met by current environment or not.
