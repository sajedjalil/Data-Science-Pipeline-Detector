I created it as a baseline to evaluate my other bots against it\nbut I am surprised myself how good it still performs a week into the competition. (At the time of writing it is number three :-))\n\nIt is a simple adaptation from the starter bot and all it does is:\n- In stadards always shot\n- If you don't have the ball, go to the ball\n- If you have the ball, go towards the goal\n- If you are close to the goal, shot\n\nMaybe it can serve as a baseline for other people as well who wants to know what they need to beat to get higher up the ladder."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install:\n# Kaggle environments.\n!git clone https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments.git\n!cd kaggle-environments && pip install .\n\n# GFootball environment.\n!apt-get update -y\n!apt-get install -y libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev\n\n# Make sure that the Branch in git clone and in wget call matches !!\n!git clone -b v2.3 https://github.com/google-research/football.git\n!mkdir -p football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib\n\n!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gfootball/prebuilt_gameplayfootball_v2.3.so -O football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib/prebuilt_gameplayfootball.so\n!cd football && GFOOTBALL_USE_PREBUILT_SO=1 pip3 install .\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile submission.py\nfrom kaggle_environments.envs.football.helpers import *\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndirections = [\n[Action.TopLeft, Action.Top, Action.TopRight],\n[Action.Left, Action.Idle, Action.Right],\n[Action.BottomLeft, Action.Bottom, Action.BottomRight]]\n\ndirsign = lambda x: 1 if abs(x) < 0.01 else (0 if x < 0 else 2)\n\nenemyGoal = [1, 0]\nperfectRange = [[0.6, 1], [-0.2, 0.2]]\n\ndef inside(pos, area):\n    return area[0][0] <= pos[0] <= area[0][1] and area[1][0] <= pos[1] <= area[1][1]\n\n@human_readable_agent\ndef agent(obs):\n    controlled_player_pos = obs['left_team'][obs['active']]\n\n    if obs[\"game_mode\"] == GameMode.Penalty:\n        return Action.Shot\n    if obs[\"game_mode\"] == GameMode.Corner:\n        if controlled_player_pos[0] > 0:\n            return Action.Shot\n    if obs[\"game_mode\"] == GameMode.FreeKick:\n        return Action.Shot\n    # Make sure player is running.\n    if  0 < controlled_player_pos[0] < 0.6 and Action.Sprint not in obs['sticky_actions']:\n        return Action.Sprint\n    elif 0.6 < controlled_player_pos[0] and Action.Sprint in obs['sticky_actions']:\n        return Action.ReleaseSprint\n\n    # Does the player we control have the ball?\n    if obs['ball_owned_player'] == obs['active'] and obs['ball_owned_team'] == 0:\n        goalkeeper = 0\n        if inside(controlled_player_pos, perfectRange) and controlled_player_pos[0] < obs['ball'][0]:\n            return Action.Shot\n        elif abs(obs['right_team'][goalkeeper][0] - 1) > 0.2 and controlled_player_pos[0] > 0.4 and abs(controlled_player_pos[1]) < 0.2:\n            return Action.Shot\n        else:\n            xdir = dirsign(enemyGoal[0] - controlled_player_pos[0])\n            ydir = dirsign(enemyGoal[1] - controlled_player_pos[1])\n            return directions[ydir][xdir]\n    else:\n        # Run towards the ball.\n        xdir = dirsign(obs['ball'][0] - controlled_player_pos[0])\n        ydir = dirsign(obs['ball'][1] - controlled_player_pos[1])\n        return directions[ydir][xdir]\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up the Environment.\nfrom kaggle_environments import make\nenv = make(\"football\", configuration={\"save_video\": True, \"scenario_name\": \"11_vs_11_kaggle\", \"running_in_notebook\": True}, debug=True)\noutput = env.run([\"/kaggle/working/submission.py\", \"do_nothing\"])[-1]\nprint('Left player: reward = %s, status = %s, info = %s' % (output[0]['reward'], output[0]['status'], output[0]['info']))\nprint('Right player: reward = %s, status = %s, info = %s' % (output[1]['reward'], output[1]['status'], output[1]['info']))\nenv.render(mode=\"human\", width=800, height=600)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
