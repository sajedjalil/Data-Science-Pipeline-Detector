To have reliable local validation, it is important to mimic the train/test split. So, let us focus on train vs. test EDA first. Based on the EDA findings we would clean data, including filling of missing entries by querying TMDB API. Along the way we would explore potential curiosities about film industry. As a helping step, we would perform adversarial validation.\n    * [EDA and data cleaning](#EDA-and-data-cleaning)\n        * [Was train/test split time-based?](#Was-the-organizers'-train/test-split-time-based?)\n        * [Budget analysis](#Budget-analysis) \n        * [Rating analysis](#Rating-analysis)\n        * [Adversarial validation](#Adversarial-validation)\n        * [Popularity Analysis](#Popularity-Analysis)\n        * [Overview and tagline analysis](#Overview-and-tagline-analysis)\n        * [Filling in missing values using TMDB API](#Filling-in-missing-values-using-TMDB-API)\n3.

It cites the study by Bettig from 1996 showing that less than 3% of released movies are going to become box office hits. As a result, Hesmondhalgh argures that *\"in the cultural industries, companies tend to offset misses against hits by means of ‘overproduction’ (Hirsch, 1990), attempting to put together a large catalogue or ‘cultural repertoire’ (Garnham, 1990) or, to put it another way, ‘throwing mud’ – or other similar substances – ‘against the wall’ to see what sticks (Laing, 1985: 9; Negus, 1999: 34).\"*\n\nThese tendencies might explain what we observe: the companies tend to produce more and more movies betting on success of just a few hits which should cover all the costs. Good news is that in the figure above we indeed see more and more successful movies with good rankings. Yet, as we've seen and as Hesmondhalgh argues, to get there, companies might need to produce more and more not so successful movies.\n\nTo sum up, I believe we should not be afraid of the film-industry apocalypse \"estimated\" before, and future generations would hopefully have enough great movies :)\n\n______________\n*Please note that I tried to remove the ranking outlier movies as well as to hide zeros and tens under NaNs. Neither improved the score. In our case having more data seem to help the model even if those additional data have distributions of parameters slightly away from the corresponding test distributions.

And the commonly used threshold of 30 is an empirical way to check that the sample is large enough. In our case we perform 5-fold CV, therefore we have only 5 samples.
