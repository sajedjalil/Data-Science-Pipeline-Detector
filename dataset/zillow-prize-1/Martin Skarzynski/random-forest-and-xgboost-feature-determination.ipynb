Kaggle was [purchased by Google](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/google-is-acquiring-data-science-community-kaggle/) earlier this year. \nThe Zillow Prize competition has recently declared to be the [second largest data science challenge on Kaggle](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-prize-ranks-as-one-of-most-popular-machine-learning-contests-of-all-time-300539347.html).\nThe purpose of the Zillow prize is to inspire data scientists around the world to work on improving the accuracy of the Zillow \"Zestimate\" <cite data-cite=\"5251998/F6YV2BYE\"></cite> home price estimate algorithm. ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Zestimate Algorithm","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Zillow’s Zestimate home valuation was first released in 2006 <cite data-cite=\"5251998/6ZB7HZKT\"></cite> and has since had a major impact on the United States real estate industry. The Zestimate algorithm created a new standard of providing free, publicly available housing data and home price estimates. \nThe Zestimate algorithm relies on [\"7.5 million statistical and machine learning models\"](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-prize-ranks-as-one-of-most-popular-machine-learning-contests-of-all-time-300539347.html) that have been refined over the years to have a [margin of error on only 5%](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1).\n\nThe real estate industry is a major contributor to the U.S economy and was worth roughly [30 trillion dollars in 2016](https://www.zillow.com/research/2016-total-home-value-rents-14028/). Homeownership equity is a major form of wealth that Americans hold, while mortgages are a major type of American private debt. It is extremely important for U.S. homeowners and for the U.S. economy that home prices are estimated correctly. Without proper estimates, lender and borrowers cannot confidently monitor their assets and liabilities. Overevaluation of real estate assets and the potential returns on real estate debt for lenders has been linked to the great recession. <cite data-cite=\"5251998/GKWP3DLG\"></cite> ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## My Goal","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"My goal in working with the Zillow Prize data was to answer the question of which features in the dataset are the most important determinants of the major evaluation metric for the Zillow Prize. This metric is called \"logerror\" in the data and is defined as the difference between the log of Zestimate price and the log of the actual sales price. To achieve this goal, I cleaned the provided housing valuation data and employed two different machine learning methods, random forest and xgboost, to calculate importance scores for each of the features in the cleaned dataset.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Methods","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"I obtained the data from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data).

This knowledge will allow me to compete in future Kaggle challenges and share my code in the form of Kaggle kernels. I also learned how to use Docker images for reproducibility, which is a useful means of recreating the environment in which a data analysis was completed.
