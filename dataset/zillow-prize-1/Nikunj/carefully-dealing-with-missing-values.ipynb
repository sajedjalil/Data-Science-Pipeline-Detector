but I've not illustrated here in the interest of the kernel speed.\n\nIdeally after each step taken to deal with missing values you would probably want to carry out some cross-validation to see if it has helped improve your model - I haven't done this here but it would be interested to know if any of the adjustments do help improve the score so please comment if they do!\n\nAs always if you found the kernel useful please upvote :) "},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"859bd85e-a886-4a5a-bb18-a6efee0010c7","_uuid":"b71062412ed7a39b993a20b756b9d4fdb9a78426"},"execution_count":null,"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom sklearn import neighbors\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"fb6663ad-72aa-4224-9585-79cad44bb0a3","_uuid":"136942079e1bb90fbb48402ea0a4c4537a69a7b8"},"execution_count":null,"source":"#Start of by reading in the data and merging the datasets\nprop = pd.read_csv('../input/properties_2016.csv')\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train_2016_v2.csv\")\n\nfor c, dtype in zip(prop.columns, prop.dtypes):\t\n    if dtype == np.float64:\t\t\n        prop[c] = prop[c].astype(np.float32)\n\ndf_train = train.merge(prop, how='left', on='parcelid')\ndel prop, train\ndf_train = df_train.drop(['parcelid', 'transactiondate'], axis=1)\n"},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"45797c73-0fca-44ee-9dd1-33948cc8aad7","_uuid":"5776538d8b966a732582288a2d9abc3c07646e6d"},"execution_count":null,"source":"#Identify numerical columns to produce a heatmap\ncatcols = ['airconditioningtypeid','architecturalstyletypeid','buildingqualitytypeid','buildingclasstypeid','decktypeid','fips','hashottuborspa','heatingorsystemtypeid','pooltypeid10','pooltypeid2','pooltypeid7','propertycountylandusecode','propertylandusetypeid','propertyzoningdesc','rawcensustractandblock','regionidcity','regionidcounty','regionidneighborhood','regionidzip','storytypeid','typeconstructiontypeid','yearbuilt','taxdelinquencyflag']\nnumcols = [x for x in df_train.columns if x not in catcols]\n\n#Lets start by plotting a heatmap to determine if any variables are correlated\nplt.figure(figsize = (12,8))\nsns.heatmap(data=df_train[numcols].corr())\nplt.show()\nplt.gcf().clear()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4c59783b-3781-4157-a5ce-ab71984c138a","_uuid":"11315617471102d30266a6e8533d640a7c02843d"},"source":"Let's start by removing some 'potentially' redundant variables\n\nThe following are all very strongly correlated as can be seen by the dark red path in the heatmap:\n'calculatedfinishedsquarefeet'\n'finishedsquarefeet12'\n'finishedsquarefeet13'\n'finishedsquarefeet15'\n'finishedsquarefeet6'\n\nBy looking at the claims description they represent very similair pieces of information (the area of the property) lets pick the one with the fewest number of missing values and drop the rest.

Also don't forgot to change fraction to 1 when you run this script (I have left it as 0.15 to prevent the kernel timing out)\n- As mentioned above, it would be reasonable to check that properties with missing values being predicted using knn are close to properties with missing values. Ie make sure your not predicting missing values using properties extremely far away in different cities/neighbourhoods etc\n- The adjustments above also have to be made to the test data, so potentially combined the train and test data and make the same adjustments\n- Prior to fitting models, categorical variables need to be one-hot encoded (there are some categorical features encoded as numbers and some tree-based methods may by default assume they are ordinal!). Probably a good idea to transform some of the skewed features aswell.\n\nJust a thought - I think we need to be very careful how we treat outliers that exist in test set. We are trying to predict errors in Zillows model. Potentially bigger errors are most likely to exist if there are outliers/errors in the data - for example, in the notebook above we spotted 2 claims where the area of the first floor is bigger than the area of the total property - probably a data error and these  two properties have errors which are larger than the average (Zillows model probably found it hard to predict them due to them being outliers/erros in data entry). But we want to be able predict these big errors and correcting these outliers I don't think will help. Likewise properties with missing values may be more difficult to predict by the Zillow model and therefore have big errors  - so filling in the missing values won't neccesarily help (which contradicts the purpose of this notebook! :) )\n\nIts probably worthwhile doing doing cross-validation work after making each change to understand if the changes help \n\nInterested to hear if any of the adjustments outlined in the notebook helps improve your score, so please comment if they do! \n\nPlease upvote if you found this notebook useful aswell :)\n"}]}
