A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables into a form digestable for algorithms without losing valuable information.

I won't be doing any feature engineering - just encoding schemes.\n\nThese categorical variables include:\n* **Binary** features\n* **Nominal** features (of varying cardinality)\n* **Ordinal** features (of varying cardinality)\n* **Cyclical** features\n\n#### Table of Contents\n1.
