There are no missing values for this particular data set, so no imputation is required.\n```\ntarget_mean = y_labelled.mean()\nfor col in X_labelled.columns:\n    stats = Xy_labelled.groupby(col)[\"target\"].agg([\"sum\", \"count\"])\n    likelihoods = ((stats[\"sum\"] + (800 * target_mean)) / (stats[\"count\"] + 800)).to_dict()\n    X_labelled[col] = X_labelled[col].map(likelihoods)\n    X_test[col] = X_test[col].map(lambda v: likelihoods.get(v, target_mean))\n```\nThis is a basic implementation of \"target encoding\". We use the constant `800` as a smoothing factor, providing a weighted average between the group target likelihood and the global target likelihood. (We chose this particular value based upon out-of-band testing. Any value between 500 and 1000 will work just fine.)\n\nNote that because there are values in the test set that are not in the training data, we must supply a default value for the test set, and the global target likelihood is the obvious choice.\n```\nmodel = LogisticRegression(solver=\"saga\", n_jobs=-1, random_state=0).fit(X_labelled, y_labelled)\nproba_predictions = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\n```\nWe apply LogisticRegression without any parameter tuning. Other solvers would likely perform just as well, but SAGA is the newest and documented to be fast for large datasets. Because we are evaluated on \"area under the ROC curve\", we need to submit \"proba\" probabilities rather than target values.\n```\noutput = pd.DataFrame({\"id\": X_test.index, \"target\": proba_predictions})\noutput.to_csv(\"submission.csv\", index=False)\n```\nFinally, we write out our predictions, submit, and profit from a barely-above-average LB score.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
