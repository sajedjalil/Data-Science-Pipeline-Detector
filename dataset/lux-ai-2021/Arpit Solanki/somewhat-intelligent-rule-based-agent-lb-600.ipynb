I actually was quite lost when I started, but then I picked up the starter [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ilialar/lux-ai-risk-averse-baseline) from Ilia Larchenko to try and understand what was happening and then began writing my own code from scratch. After spending several days between writing code and debugging, I have a somewhat intelligent rule based agent that's currently scoring 600+ points on leaderboard. \n\nThese were some of the strategies deployed on my bot - \n* **Deferring City Growth** - As a defensive tactic, I deferred growth of cities until sufficient fuel was collected. I defined different thresholds for fuel collection based on the size of the map. Until the threshold was hit I didn't add a second tile on the map. This was done to ensure that the first city has enough fuel to survive rest of the game before further tiles and cities are added. This was done primarily to ensure that in the case all resources and units on the maps are exhausted, there is atleast one city surviving the game\n* **Identifying tiles for City growth** - The amount of fuel required per city tile is inversely related to the number of adjacent city tiles. Therefore in order to give our cities better chance of survival, it is important to ensure that new tiles are either added closer to resources or adjacent to already existing citytiles. For every unit, I try to find the nearest adjacent city tile and move the unit towards it for constructing a new city tile. \n* **Collision Handling** - In my initial bots, lots of moves were getting cancelled because units ended up colliding with each other. I had to write a collision handling logic where I maintain a list with tiles occupied by all units and before moving a particular unit, I run a check to see if the tile where a unit is looking to move is unoccupied. This list keeps getting updated after every turn to ensure the latest position of all tiles is getting captured. \n* **Surviving the night** - If the cities & units don't have enough fuel before the onset of night, then there is a good chance that they may end up dying. Therefore its very important to ensure that all units & cities are stocked with enough fuel to survive the night. I applied checks on game turns to see if a night was approaching and ensured that units started moving back to cities before the onset of the night. Cities were sorted in the order of lowest volume of fuel and units were then assigned to cities. When night started approaching, every unit started moving back to the city assigned to it\n* **Cluster Identification** - An important aspect of this game is to ensure that the bot is able to identify big cluster of resources away from the starting point and starts growing cities there. This strategy kicks in if there are sufficient number of resources on the map. The last unit starts moving towards the biggest available cluster and starts growing the city there.\n* **Research** - Lots of maps available on the game environment have plenty of coal and uranium resources available. A city tile on any given turn has the option to either produce a worker or conduct research. The idea in initial turns is to focus more on research so that all the coal resources become accessible. Research is stopped when the uranium research is complete and thereafter the focus is only on producing more workers. \n* **Exception Handling** - I noticed a lot of matches were lost by my initial bots due to exception conditions like all resources getting exhausted on the maps or all city tiles dying. I added several try catch blocks to ensure I don't end up losing the match midway through the game. \n\n\nThis is the simple strategy deployed on my bot so far - \n1. At the beginning of the game, start moving towards resource tiles & collect resources\n2. Until a particular growth threshold has been reached, continue depositing the resources to the initial city tile\n3. Once the growth threshold has been reached, identify empty tiles adjacent to the citytile and start moving there to construct a new city tile\n4. If a night is approaching, ensure the unit moves back to the city assigned to it\n5. Once there are enough number of units on the map, ensure that the last unit is always looking to move towards the biggest cluster on the map. Once it gets there it should start growing a city on that cluster","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install kaggle-environments -U","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-24T06:01:42.536308Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-24T06:01:42.536716Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.91544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-24T06:01:42.536681Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.914288Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_environments import make\nimport json","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.918758Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.91921Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.924641Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.919155Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-24T06:01:49.923252Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# create the environment.

I hadn't really ever used python for a software engineering task. This competition has been a great learning for me so far where I have had to focus a lot on software engineering & debugging side of things while extensively using inbuilt data structures\n* **Rapid City Growth** - More successful bots in the 1000+ range are able to completely dominate the map and grow very rapidly to 20+tiles & workers. I need to figure out a way to emulate that as well\n* **Optimizing City Shape** - Cities with tiles in straight lines tend to burn more energy than cities in a polygon shape. So far my bot has a huge weakness that its developing small cities with 2-3 tiles and I am in no way optimizing for shape. Would like to do that soon.\n* **Usage of Carts** - I have come up against lots of opponents using carts & roads. Its worth a try since carts can hold up a lot of fuel and move much faster than workers. \n* **Observing Opponent Behavior** - So far my bot has only been focused on its own actions and strategy for growing on the map. It hasn't been observing what an opponent is doing and changing its strategy to best deal with it. I am not yet sure how to go about this, but I feel this change would be critical to ensure I move up on the leaderboard. \n* **Reinforcement Learning** - I have been learning the RL specialization on Coursera for a month now and the primary motivation for picking up this problem was to be able to use RL for a simulation competition. I wanted to get started with a basic rule based agent to get familiar with the problem statement and the API. Now that I have been able to achieve that, the idea is to be able to hopefully create a half decent RL agent by the end of this competition. \n\n\nI will be making lots of updates to this notebook in the coming days and weeks. Please suggest improvements or provide feedback in the comments. ","metadata":{}}]}
