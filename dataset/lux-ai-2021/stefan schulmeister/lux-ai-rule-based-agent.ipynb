Introduction and Idea </h1>\nHello everyone. Now that the competition is over, I thought I might share my purely rules-based agent with you. I started this competition as a small side project and ended up having a lot of fun with it. So i invested my evenings over the last few weeks. The core idea was to describe all the components of the game in separate classes in a classic object-oriented way. The overall structure suffered a bit from the rapid development of the leaderboard and the time lag on my side, but I think it's still okay overall and some of you may find it interesting. \n\n<hr>\nThe idea is that we have a general and five officers. The general takes the information from his five officers and decides which order each unit will receive for each step. The orders are divided into eight different types:\n<ul>\n  <li> <b>Expansion </b>       --> The unit finds the fastest or most strategic expansion spot and moves there. (or to a suitable harvesting location if the expansion location has no possible harvesting value).</li>\n  <li> <b>Harvest_Go </b>      --> Find the best location to harvest and harvest there. (go there first)</li>\n  <li> <b>Harvest_Return </b>  --> Return from harvesting to support the city with the highest priority.</li>\n  <li> <b>CitySupport </b>     --> Cities harvesting. Only if the support will generate enough to help the city survive the next night.</li>\n  <li> <b>SaveSpot </b>        --> Move to a safe place to survive the night. Can be a harvesting location with fuel_collection_amount > 4 or a city_tile of a city that survives the night.</li>\n  <li> <b>ClusterDefence </b>  --> Stands on a possible expansion spot to block this spot for enemy units.</li>\n  <li> <b>Distribution </b>    --> Move to the wood cluster that is not jet captured by the player. (This is cruel for a good agent).</li>\n  <li> <b>Blocking </b>        --> Block incoming units before they reach your cluster.</li>\n</ul> \n\nEach step begins with the Cartographer mapping the battlefield. Then the HarvestingOfficer takes these maps and creates the harvesting maps. Then the ExpansionOfficer, CityCouncyl, and MovementOfficer take these maps and create additional information for the General. Then the General takes all this information to order each unit for that step.\n\n<hr>\nLet's start with a small introduction for each class. This might make it easier to read the code later. As mentioned before, we have six main classes (the general and his five officers). In addition to that, each main class has several helper classes. However, sometimes these classes are just containers or enums.\n\n<ol>\n<li> <b> Cartographer: </b> <br> The Cartographer is the first class and maps the battlefield each turn. In addition, this class manages the distance logic on these maps.An important auxiliary class is the ResouceCluser, which is created by the Cartographer for each resource cluster. The ResourceCluster manages cluster-related information such as size, captures_by, territory, min_dist_to_opponent_unit, and more at each step of the game. This information plays an important role in unit distribution and expansion logic. </li>\n<li> <b> CityCouncil and DistrictMayor: </b> <br> As the name suggests, these classes are responsible for managing the cities. For this purpose, each city has a DistrictMajor that manages important information such as fuel_income_per_turn, number_of_possible_expansions, strategic_expansion_positions and so on. The CityCouncil is responsible for managing all DistrictMajors and thus tasks such as spawning units, research, and fuel priorities. </li>  \n<li> <b> MovementOfficer: </b> <br> The MovementOfficer handles all movement orders. It uses its MovementOptions helper class to evaluate all movement options for all units and execute them in an optimized way to make sure we have no collisions within our own units and no unnecessary blocking. </li>\n<li> <b> ExpansionOfficer: </b> <br> This class handles expansions. For this task, the class uses map information from the cartographer to create two expansion maps. A base map (which contains all possible expansion points with positive harvest value) and a strategic map that handles things like walls and other strategic things. </li>\n<li> <b> HarvestingOfficer: </b> <br> This class simply creates lists of all harvest positions and strategic harvest positions. Strategic here means, for example, that we don't want to harvest from a wood tile with less than 250 wood to prevent them from perishing when we have other options. </li>\n<li> <b> General: </b> <br> This is the main class. It uses all the information from the other classes to give all units a task for each step.</li>\n</ol>\n    \n<hr>\n\nI tried to leave some helpful comments in the code to make it easier to understand. Or at least I hope they make the code easier to understand. In the end, it was a growing project and some parts might not be consistent.( All in all, we are talking about 3.2k lines of code. So you could start by looking at some sample games in section 3.1 and using the table of contents for navigation). Please let me know what you think. \n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2.\"></a>\n<a id=\"2.1\"></a>\n<div style=\"display:fill;\n           border-radius:0px;\n           border-style: solid;\n           text-align:center;\n           font-size:17px;\n           letter-spacing:0.5px;\n           padding: 0.4em;\n           text-align:left\">  \n<h1> 2.
