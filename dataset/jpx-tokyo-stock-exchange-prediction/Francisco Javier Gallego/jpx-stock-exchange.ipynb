When a stock or derivative is undervalued, it makes sense to buy. If it's overvalued, perhaps it's time to sell. While these finance decisions were historically made manually by professionals, technology has ushered in new opportunities for retail investors. Data scientists, specifically, may be interested to explore quantitative trading, where decisions are executed programmatically based on predictions from trained models.\n\nThere are plenty of existing quantitative trading efforts used to analyze financial markets and formulate investment strategies. To create and execute such a strategy requires both historical and real-time data, which is difficult to obtain especially for retail investors. This competition will provide financial data for the Japanese market, allowing retail investors to analyze the market to the fullest extent.\n\nJapan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) is a holding company operating one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), and derivatives exchanges Osaka Exchange (OSE) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). JPX is hosting this competition and is supported by AI technology company AlpacaJapan Co.,Ltd.\n\n![](https://news.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stock-Market-pic-1200x800-c-default.jpg)\n\nThis competition will compare your models against real future returns after the training phase is complete. The competition will involve building portfolios from the stocks eligible for predictions (around 2,000 stocks). Specifically, each participant ranks the stocks from highest to lowest expected returns and is evaluated on the difference in returns between the top and bottom 200 stocks. You'll have access to financial data from the Japanese market, such as stock information and historical stock prices to train and test your model.\n\nAll winning models will be made public so that other participants can learn from the outstanding models. Excellent models also may increase the interest in the market among retail investors, including those who want to practice quantitative trading. At the same time, you'll gain your own insights into programmatic investment methods and portfolio analysis―and you may even discover you have an affinity for the Japanese market.\n\n<div style=\"color:white;display:fill;\n            background-color:#3f4d6f;font-size:150%;\n            font-family:Nexa;letter-spacing:0.5px\">\n    <p style=\"padding: 8px;color:white;\"><b>1.2 | References</b></p>\n</div>\n\nBefore starting, just mention some astonishing works from which I got some new ideas and inspiration. **Take a look on them !**\n\n- [Easy to understand the competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chumajin/easy-to-understand-the-competition)\n- [JPX - Detailed EDA.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abaojiang/jpx-detailed-eda)\n- [Useful features in Predicting Stock Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/code/riteshsinha/useful-features-in-predicting-stock-prices#Analyzing-SMA-(Simple-Moving-Averages)-and-EMA-(Exponential-Moving-Averages))\n\n<div style=\"color:white;display:fill;\n            background-color:#3f4d6f;font-size:150%;\n            font-family:Nexa;letter-spacing:0.5px\">\n    <p style=\"padding: 8px;color:white;\"><b>1.3 | Importing Packages</b></p>\n</div>","metadata":{"_uuid":"03a9a916-600a-4cf5-9601-1381f9ce3d4c","_cell_guid":"394c90e9-994d-414d-ace8-c584017296cf","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import clear_output\nimport os\nimport warnings\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Basic libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pandas_profiling as pp\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Clustering\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n#Mutual Information\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression\n\n# Cross Validation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold, learning_curve, train_test_split\n\n# Encoding\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OrdinalEncoder\nfrom category_encoders import MEstimateEncoder\nfrom category_encoders import MEstimateEncoder\n\n# Algorithms\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom catboost import CatBoostClassifier\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n\n# Optuna - Bayesian Optimization \nimport optuna\nfrom optuna.samplers import TPESampler\n\n# Plotly\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport plotly.offline as offline\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n# Spaceship Titanic Metric\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\ndef load_data():\n    data_dir = Path(\"../input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction\")\n    train_dir = Path(\"../input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/train_files\")\n    stock_prices = pd.read_csv(train_dir / \"stock_prices.csv\")\n    financials = pd.read_csv(train_dir / \"financials.csv\")\n    options = pd.read_csv(train_dir / \"options.csv\")\n    secondary_stock_prices = pd.read_csv(train_dir / \"secondary_stock_prices.csv\")\n    stock_list = pd.read_csv('../input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/stock_list.csv')    \n    return stock_prices, financials, options, secondary_stock_prices, stock_list\n\ndef plot_feature_importance(importance,names,model_type):\n    \n    #Create arrays from feature importance and feature names\n    feature_importance = np.array(importance)\n    feature_names = np.array(names)\n    \n    #Create a DataFrame using a Dictionary\n    data={'feature_names':feature_names,'feature_importance':feature_importance}\n    fi_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    \n    #Sort the DataFrame in order decreasing feature importance\n    fi_df.sort_values(by=['feature_importance'], ascending=False,inplace=True)\n    fi_df = fi_df[fi_df.feature_importance > 0]\n    fig = px.bar(fi_df, x='feature_names', y='feature_importance', color=\"feature_importance\",\n             color_continuous_scale='Blugrn')\n    # General Styling\n    fig.update_layout(height=400, bargap=0.2,\n                  margin=dict(b=50,r=30,l=100,t=100),\n                  title = \"<span style='font-size:36px;

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined.\n\nFor a unimodal distribution, negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule. For example, a zero value means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution, but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat. A skewness greater than 1 is generally judged to be skewed, so check mainly those greater than 1.","metadata":{"_uuid":"35a5dcb0-62a3-4fda-9a20-321a8c197f1c","_cell_guid":"a28c8bff-7521-42b7-946e-8fa0d3bc0b65","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\nprint('Skewness: ', skew(stock_prices[stock_prices.Target.isnull() == False]['Target']))","metadata":{"_uuid":"830d28ee-ffb2-44db-8edf-7ba0f0c97876","_cell_guid":"c51cbf1f-3b0c-4687-a490-447d08fc8ef4","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.033377Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.033788Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.247657Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.033736Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.246461Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Kurtosis:** In probability theory and statistics, kurtosis is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.\n\nThe standard measure of a distribution's kurtosis, originating with Karl Pearson, is a scaled version of the fourth moment of the distribution. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak; hence, the sometimes-seen characterization of kurtosis as \"peakedness\" is incorrect. For this measure, higher kurtosis corresponds to greater extremity of deviations (or outliers), and not the configuration of data near the mean.","metadata":{"_uuid":"f9bd5efe-9920-4e76-975e-620e26bd93fc","_cell_guid":"827786b0-b07a-4fe2-b5cd-6a67c6dd4fdc","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Kurtosis: ', kurtosis(stock_prices[stock_prices.Target.isnull() == False]['Target']))","metadata":{"_uuid":"7a44362c-94f9-4db5-92a9-dde0261e7cfa","_cell_guid":"08bc3371-3cd3-476e-90ae-27e890d60d71","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.251166Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.251908Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.459286Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.251862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-07T23:49:32.458113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.histogram(stock_prices[stock_prices.Target.isnull() == False], x='Target', nbins = 1000, color_discrete_sequence = [px.colors.sequential.Viridis[5]])\nfig.add_vline(x=stock_prices[stock_prices.Target.isnull() == False]['Target'].mean(), line_width=3, line_dash=\"dash\", line_color = px.colors.qualitative.Plotly[1])\n\nfig.update_xaxes(range = [-0.3,0.3])\n\n# General Styling\nfig.update_layout(height=400, bargap=0.2,                  \n                  margin=dict(r=30,l=100, t=100, b=0),\n                  plot_bgcolor='rgb(242,242,242)',\n                  #paper_bgcolor = 'rgb(242,242,242)',\n                  font=dict(family=\"Times New Roman\", size= 14),\n                  hoverlabel=dict(font_color=\"floralwhite\"),\n                  showlegend=False)\n#Title\ntext = [\n    \"<span style='font-size:35px; font-family:Times New Roman'>Target Distribution</span>\"\n]\nannotation_helper(fig, text, -0.043, 1.4, [0.095,0.095,0.065],ref=\"paper\", width=1300)\n\n#Subtitle\ntext = [\n    \"<span style='font-size:14px; font-family:Helvetica'> Target seems to have a <b>simmetric</b> distribution.

We'll begin by plotting an OHLCV chart for one of the stocks of the dataset. For a decent understanding of these charts, it is preferable to look at them in depth. In the following, therefore, we will see how to interpret them without making any mistakes. \n\n**Detail of candlestick charts**: In order to start creating and interpreting a candlestick chart, the first thing to know is that the data contains price highs, lows, opens and closes. The empty and coloured portions of the bars, are called the \"body\". The long thin lines above and below the body represent the upward or downward ranges and are generally referred to as \"shadows\", \"highlights\" or \"tails\". If the lines are placed at the top of the body, this will indicate the rising and closing price, while the line at the bottom of the chart will indicate the falling and closing price at that position. \n\n![](https://www.avatrade.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/candlestick_1.png)\n\nThe colours of the body of the candlestick vary depending on the broker, showing green or blue if the price is rising, and red if the price is falling. Longer versus shorter bodies will indicate buying or selling pressure among traders. Short bodies represent that little movement is taking place. One of the most reliable and popular patterns in chart analysis is the head and shoulders pattern. This is a pattern that indicates a change in trajectory. That is to say that its formation will signal that the current trend is soon to register a change, either from upward to downward or vice versa. There are two versions of the head and shoulders pattern:\n\n![](https://www.avatrade.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/head-shoulders.png)\n\n* **Head and shoulders top.** Usually formed at the peak of an uptrend and indicates that the price of the asset is ready to fall once the pattern is completed.\n* **Head and shoulders base (or head and shoulders reversal)**. Usually formed during a downtrend, it indicates that the price of the asset is ready to move upwards.\n\nThis following chart function was taken from [JPX - Detailed EDA.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abaojiang/jpx-detailed-eda)","metadata":{"_uuid":"0bd2dd1f-37c5-4544-9097-833285c49cb2","_cell_guid":"f5a1f407-c510-42c4-a241-6c69e3c55cf8","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_candle_with_target(stock_code, prime=True):    \n    df_ = stock_prices.copy() if prime else df_prices_sec.copy()\n    df_ = df_[df_['SecuritiesCode'] == stock_code]\n    dates = df_['Date'].values\n    ohlc = {\n        'open': df_['Open'].values, \n        'high': df_['High'].values, \n        'low': df_['Low'].values, \n        'close': df_['Close'].values\n    }\n    vol = df_['Volume'].values\n    target = df_['Target'].values\n    \n    fig = make_subplots(rows=3, cols=1, shared_xaxes=True, x_title='Date')\n    fig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(x=dates, name='OHLC', **ohlc),\n                  row=1, col=1)\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=dates, y=vol, name='Volume'),\n                  row=2, col=1)\n    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=dates, y=target, name='Target', marker = dict(color = px.colors.sequential.Viridis[5])),\n                  row=3, col=1)\n    \n    fig.update(layout_xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False)\n    \n    # General Styling\n    fig.update_layout(height=600, bargap=0.2,\n                      margin=dict(r=30,l=100, t=150, b=0),\n                      plot_bgcolor='rgb(242,242,242)',\n                      #paper_bgcolor = 'rgb(242,242,242)',\n                      font=dict(family=\"Times New Roman\", size= 14),\n                      hoverlabel=dict(font_color=\"floralwhite\"),\n                      showlegend=False)\n    #Title\n    text = [\n        \"<span style='font-size:35px; font-family:Times New Roman'>CandleStick Chart with target series</span>\"\n    ]\n    annotation_helper(fig, text, -0.043, 1.35, [0.095,0.095,0.065],ref=\"paper\", width=1300)\n    #Subtitle\n    text = [\n        \"<span style='font-size:14px; font-family:Helvetica'> CandleStick chart includes several key pieces of information per each data point recorded in the chart.

If we assume an additive decomposition, then we can write $y_t=S_t+T_t+R_t$, where $y_t$ is the target, $S_t$ is the seasonal component, $T_t$ is the trend-cycle component and $R_t$ is the residual component, all at period $t$. Also,for a multiplicative decomposition, we have $y_t=S_t*T_t*R_t$.\n\nThe additive decomposition is the most appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations, or the variation around the trend-cycle, does not vary with the level of the time series. When the variation in the seasonal pattern, or the variation around the trend-cycle, appears to be proportional to the level of the time series, then a multiplicative decomposition is more appropriate. Multiplicative decompositions are common with economic time series.\n\n#### **Trend**\n\nThe trend component of a time series represents a persistent, long-term change in the mean of the series. The trend is the slowest-moving part of a series, the part representing the largest time scale of importance. In a time series of product sales, an increasing trend might be the effect of a market expansion as more people become aware of the product year by year.\n\n#### **Seasonality**\n\nWe say that a time series exhibits seasonality whenever there is a regular, periodic change in the mean of the series. Seasonal changes generally follow the clock and calendar - repetitions over a day, a week, or a year are common. Seasonality is often driven by the cycles of the natural world over days and years or by conventions of social behavior surrounding dates and times.\n\n####

Securities markets are divided into primary and secondary markets, separating the securities issuance phase and the subsequent trading phase. It is called primary market when the financial assets exchanged are newly created, the suppliers of securities in the market are the entities in need of financial resources and that come to this market to issue their securities, on the side of the demanders are the investors, who with surplus financial resources come to these markets to acquire securities. The securities are issued in the primary market, which is used to raise savings and therefore raises new financing, and the securities already acquired are subsequently traded in the secondary market, which is a second-hand or resale market. **The placing of shares on the primary market always involves an increase in a company's share capital. Secondary market shares, on the other hand, are securities that already exist in the company and do not represent an increase in the company's share capital.**\n\n* `33SectorCode`: 33 Sector Name [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_13_sector.pdf).\n* `33SectorName`: 33 Sector Name [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_13_sector.pdf)\n* `17SectorCode`: 17 Sector Code [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_13_sector.pdf).\n* `17SectorName`: 17 Sector Name [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_13_sector.pdf).\n* `NewIndexSeriesSizeCode`: TOPIX New Index Series code [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_).\n* `NewIndexSeriesSize`: TOPIX New Index Series Name [ref](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/markets/indices/line-up/files/e_fac_).\n* `TradeDate`: Trade date to calculate MarketCapitalization.\n* `Close`: Close price to calculate MarketCapitalization.\n* `IssuedShares`: Issued shares.\n* `MarketCapitalization`: Market capitalization on Dec 3 2021.\n* `Universe0`: a flag of prediction target universe (top 2000 stocks by market capitalization).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pp.ProfileReport(stock_list)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T23:54:21.309423Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T23:54:21.309679Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T23:54:41.176205Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-07T23:54:21.309648Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-07T23:54:41.175436Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Early Insights:** analysing the previous report we are able to conclude the following: \n\n* More than a half of the stocks belongs to companies from **First Sector**.
