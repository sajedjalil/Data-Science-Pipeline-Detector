The tutorial covers sentiment analysis; specifically, text-processing and utilizing Bag-Of-Words and Word2Vec. Bag-Of-Words is the traditional method of understanding semantic relationships among words, while Word2Vec is Google's new deep-learning approach.  \n\nSentiment analysis is determining the meaning underlying a language. It is challenging as people express themselves in obscure ways using sarcasm or ambiguity.\n\nThe goal of the kernel is to create a model that can accurately determine if a movie review is positive or negative. The dataset consists of 100,000 IMDB positive and negative multi-paragraph movie reviews. Submissions are juded on area under the ROC curve."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# [2] Bag of Words"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.chdir('/kaggle/input/utilities')\nfrom data import DataLoader\nos.chdir(\"/kaggle/working/\")\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport re\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom gensim.models import word2vec\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s',\\\n    level=logging.INFO)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# [2.1] The Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dl = DataLoader('/kaggle/input/word2vec-nlp-tutorial')\ndl.files","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dl.load_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\n    'labeledTrainData.tsv',\n    header=0,\n    delimiter=\"\\t\",\n    quoting=3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(train['review'][0][500:1000])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# [2.2] Preprocessing\n\nWe need to remove HTML tags, abbreviations, punctiations, etc.  \n\nWe can use BeautifulSoup to remove all HTML content."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"example = BeautifulSoup(train['review'][0])\nprint(example.get_text()[500:1000])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To deal with punctuation, numbers, and stop words, we can use NLTK and regular expressions.
