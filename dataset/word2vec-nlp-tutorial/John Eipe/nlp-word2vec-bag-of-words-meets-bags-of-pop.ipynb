If we were working with email data, on the other hand, the word “movie” may not be frequent and would be useful.\n\nThe simplest way to account for these overrepresented words is to divide word count by the proportion of text documents each word appeared in. For example, the document:\n> “I loved this movie! It was great, great, great.”\n\ncontains the word “loved” and “movie” once each. Now, let’s suppose that we look at all the other documents and find that, in total, “loved” appears in 1% of text documents and “movie” appears in 33%. We could now weight our scores as\n\n`“loved” = times it appears in text / proportion of texts it appears in = 1 / 1%`\n`“movie” = times it appears in text / proportion of texts it appears in = 1 / 33%`\n\nBefore applying weights, both “loved” and “movie” had a score of 1 (since each word appeared in the sentence once). After we apply weights, “loved” has a score of 100 and “movie” has a score of 3. The score for “loved” is much higher relative to “movie”, indicating that we care about the word “loved” much more than “movie”.\n\nIn fact, our score for “loved” is now 33 times larger than our score for “movie”. While we suspect that “movie” should be less important than “loved” for predicting whether a review is positive or negative, this relative difference might be too big. Very rare words — perhaps, misspelled words — will receive too much relative weight in our current weighting scheme.\n\nWe need to strike a balance between downweighting very frequent words without overweighting rare words. This is what term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighting does for us. In the simple weighting scheme, we used the formula:\n\n`times a word appears in text * (1 / proportion of texts it appears in)`\n\ntf-idf weighting alters this formula slightly by taking the log of the second term:\n\n`times a word appears in text * log(1 / proportion of texts it appears in)`\n\nBy taking the log, we ensure that our weight changes slowly in relation to how frequently a word appears in all our documents. \nThis means that while common words are downweighted, they aren’t downweighted too much."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://miro.medium.com/max/428/1*VJoVz80UUvU2m_ln70JxeQ.png)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To read more about tf-idf see this medium post: \nhttps://medium.com/civis-analytics/an-intro-to-natural-language-processing-in-python-framing-text-classification-in-familiar-terms-33778d1aa3ca"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\npipe = Pipeline([('count', countVectorizer),('tfid', TfidfTransformer())]).fit(clean_train_reviews)\ntrain_data_features = pipe.transform(clean_train_reviews)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"type(train_data_features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data_features.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.asarray(train_data_features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print (\"Training the random forest (this may take a while)...\")\n\n\n# Initialize a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees\nforest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 100)\n\n# Fit the forest to the training set, using the bag of words as\n# features and the sentiment labels as the response variable\n#\n# This may take a few minutes to run\nforest = forest.fit( train_data_features, train[\"sentiment\"] )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Testing - we pick only the first 2 test reviews alone to save time\n\n\n# Create an empty list and append the clean reviews one by one\nclean_test_reviews = []\n\nprint(\"Cleaning and parsing the test set movie reviews...\\n\")\nfor i in range(0,2):\n    clean_test_reviews.append(\" \".join(KaggleWord2VecUtility.review_to_wordlist(test[\"review\"][i], True)))\n\n# Get a bag of words for the test set, and convert to a numpy array\ntest_data_features = countVectorizer.transform(clean_test_reviews)\nnp.asarray(test_data_features)\n\n# Use the random forest to make sentiment label predictions\nprint (\"Predicting test labels...\\n\")\nresult = forest.predict(test_data_features)\n\n# Write the test results \nprint(\"*****manual verification*******\")\nprint(test[\"review\"][0])\nprint(result[0])\nprint(test[\"review\"][1])\nprint(result[1])\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 2"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Distributed Word Vectors\n\nWord2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words.

For details on the algorithms below, see the word2vec API documentation as well as the Google documentation. \n\n1. Architecture: Architecture options are skip-gram (default) or continuous bag of words. We found that skip-gram was very slightly slower but produced better results.\n1. Training algorithm: Hierarchical softmax (default) or negative sampling. For us, the default worked well.\n1. Downsampling of frequent words: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\nReferences: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/95266/subsampling-of-frequent-words-in-word2vec\n1. Word vector dimensionality: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n1. Context / window size: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n1. Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n1. Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles.
