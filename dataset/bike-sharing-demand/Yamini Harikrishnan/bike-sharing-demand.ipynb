Ernest Callenbach 's novel Ecotopia (1975) illustrated the idea. \n\n# Wiki \n\nA bicycle-sharing system, public bicycle scheme,or public bike share (PBS) scheme,is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a \"dock\" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place. Other systems are dockless.\n\n\n# Advantages of bike-sharing systems \n\nThey use smart-cards to allow the bicycles to be returned to any station in the system, which facilitates one-way rides to work, education or shopping centres. Thus, one bike may take 10–15 rides a day with different users and can be ridden up to 10,000 km\n\nThe data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city.\n\n# For many systems, smartphone mapping apps show nearby available bikes and open docks. In July 2020, Google Maps began including bike shares in its route recommendations\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"filename = (\"../input/bike-sharing-demand/train.csv\")\n\ntrain=pd.read_csv(filename)\n\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Attribute Information:\n\ndatetime - hourly date + timestamp\nseason - 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter\n\nholiday - whether the day is considered a holiday\n\nworkingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday\n\nweather - \n* 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy \n* 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n* 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n* 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n\ntemp - temperature in Celsius\n\natemp - \"feels like\" temperature in Celsius\n\nhumidity - relative humidity\n\nwindspeed - wind speed\n\ncasual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated\n\nregistered - number of registered user rentals initiated\n\ncount - number of total rentals"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# My Hypothesis \n\nGeneral factors that would impact the prediction of increase in bike demand for rentals are -\n\n1) Favourable seasons to enjoy bike ride \n\n2) Clear Weather conditions suitable for bike riding\n\n3) Holidays for biking recreation purposes\n\n4) Working days - Fitness enthusiasts who may commute to schools/colleges/work during weekdays"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.isnull().sum() \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are No null values.\n\n\nThere are some Columns which have interger values for season, holiday,weather,working day columns but these should be categorical data types.
