The following is just my opinion. \n\nFrom a logical point of view, unless the shops price their products in USD, the GDP in local currency should be used. If they priced in USD and the USD became stronger, then indeed the products would appear as more expensive to the locals, and the number of items sold would decrease, following what the GDP in USD would suggest. Also, as we are forecasting the number of items sold, not the sales in currency units, the real GDP, which is inflation adjusted, should be used instead of the nominal GDP. This is because the item price should go up with inflation, so the number of items sold would stay the same if the real GDP stayed flat, for example.\n\nFrom the point of view of this competition, whichever GDP gives a higher score on the LB should be the one to use :-).
