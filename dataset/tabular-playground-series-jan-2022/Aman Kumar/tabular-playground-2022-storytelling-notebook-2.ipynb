I'll try to look through this dataset, do some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and try to build a story using beautiful yet impactful open-source visualization tool - Flourish. Flourish makes it easy to visualize data using easy approaches without need of code. Interactive data dashboarding to analytics storytelling, that's what I wish to explore in the Playground Jan 22' Series.  \n\nThis data doesn't simulates a real-world environment, but data storytelling is a fun thing to do.

Unavailability of Goods or partial closure of few stores, might be a potential cause for this trend.

I'll possibly be doing comparable analysis for Norway & Sweden as well, when done. Would update the notebook ;)\n\nI always loved building stories out of data, and I loved very much writing these series of 2 notebooks to answer some basic questions with open source visualization tools. [Marília Prata](https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke) made me aware about the event, and with concluding the last notebook on this series, I would specially like to Thank you, for the great source of inspiration & support you had been to me.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions on this notebook. Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amankumar01/). It was happy writing this notebook. Cheers!!","metadata":{}}]}
