We've been provided with a number of datasets around match score statistics, player records, awards & events within a season. In this notebook we'll be looking to understand the datasets provided and try and understand how different factors like scores, teams, time of the year contribute to variations in player Engagement. \n\nIf you like me don't have lot of domain knowledge about baseball then this discussion [thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlb-player-digital-engagement-forecasting/discussion/245457) will be a good place to understand the format of the tournament as well as rules for the game & the statistics measured in baseball.\n\n\n## Datasets Provided\n* **train.csv** - Dataset at a playerId, date level. Contains nested JSONs for following - ```games, rosters, playerBoxScores, teamBoxScores, awards, events, playerEngagement etc.``` etc. The 4 playerEngagement variables are - ```target1, target2, target3, target4``` target1-target4 are each daily indexes of digital engagement on a 0-100 scale. Data is provided from 2018 - 2021.\n* **teams.csv** - Dataset containing info for teams like ```teamName, location, league & division``` that they play in.\n* **seasons.csv** - Contains dates for various phases of a season - ``preSeason, regularSeason, playoffs, postseason`` etc. from 2017-2021\n* **players.csv** - Dataset containing info for players - ```DOB, birthcountry,mlbDebutDate, position``` etc. \n\n\n## Initial Questions on Data<a name=\"que\"></a>\n\n* How do the four target engagement variables vary from one year to the other and how are they related to each other?\n* How does engagament score decay with time after a baseball game?\n* How are engagement score values autocorrelated with each other?\n* How do engagement scores vary with time of the year & progress of the season? Is there seasonality associated with these scores?\n* Does successful teams enjoy higher engagement scores compared to remaining teams? Do higher ranked teams see more engagement from fans?\n* How does starting position of a player play a role in driving engagement scores? Are players in certain positions likely to drive higher engagement?\n* How does a player's demographic attributes play a role in determining their engagement scores?\n* How do run scoring & pitching stats impact engagement scores? Does good & bad performance both lead to higher engagement from fans?\n\n## Importing the datasets<a name=\"import\"></a>\n\nThis section below has been borrowed from the notebook provided by the competition organizers. The section of code below unpacks the JSON for various columns in the ```train.csv``` and creates a nice tabular dataset for us to run further analyses.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip install raceplotly","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.1805Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.180908Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.185727Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.180825Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.184362Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing packages\nimport gc\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport ipywidgets as widgets\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.deterministic import (CalendarFourier,\n                                           CalendarSeasonality,\n                                           CalendarTimeTrend,\n                                           DeterministicProcess)\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\n\n#from raceplotly.plots import barplot\n\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\n# Set Matplotlib defaults\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn-whitegrid\")\nplt.rc(\"figure\", autolayout=True, figsize=(11, 5))\nplt.rc(\n    \"axes\",\n    labelweight=\"bold\",\n    labelsize=\"large\",\n    titleweight=\"bold\",\n    titlesize=14,\n    titlepad=10,\n)\nplot_params = dict(\n    color=\"0.75\",\n    style=\".-\",\n    markeredgecolor=\"0.25\",\n    markerfacecolor=\"0.25\",\n    legend=False,\n)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.36093Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.361261Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.8088Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T16:48:42.36123Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.807909Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load and Join Data #","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_dir = Path('../input/mlb-player-digital-engagement-forecasting/')\n#training = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'train.csv')\nplayers = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'players.csv')\n\n\n# Convert training data date field to datetime type\n#training['date'] = pd.to_datetime(training['date'], format=\"%Y%m%d\")\n\n#display(training.info())","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.812339Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.812602Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.836065Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.812575Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T16:48:47.835299Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are in addition a number of supplementary files.

Some of these players have been inactive for upto 2-3 years before they even played a game.

There are several peaks observable around 200, 800 and 1000 day period. \n* We looked at the drop in engagement immediately after the game and observed it initially goes down but then picks up again around 3-5 day period and then goes down again\n* The rise in target engagement for players after remaining inactive for 1000 days was a bit perplexing. Therefore we filtered the data for these players and identified such players. 22 year old Brailyn Marquez & 23 year old Alex Kiriloff had the highest engagement scores\n* A quick Google search revealed that some of the reasons for high engagement are player transfers & players returning from injury after a long break, leading to an increase in engagement.

Greater the number of Home Runs scored in the game, higher the engagement.**\n* Another statistic for batter performance is RBI - Runs Batted In. It shows that the number of runs scored by a team where a player was involved in. This also shows that higher the RBI number, greater the engagement for a player\n* Also the **team as a whole tends to have higher engagement levels when the runsScored are higher**.\n\nSince this is essentially a time series dataset, we should also look at autocorrelations for target variables - autocorrelation measures correlation of a time series value at any point with its previous values.
