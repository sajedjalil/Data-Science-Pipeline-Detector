The present work shows that cGAMP can leave the cell through the anion channel VRAC and diffuses to non-infected cells in the vicinity. After entering the cell – again through VRAC – it binds to a receptor called STING and stimulates indirectly the synthesis of interferon, which leaves the cell and suppresses, after binding to a receptor, the propagation of the virus (left cell). This provides a powerful amplification of the innate immune response against DNA viruses.

The experimenter uses a set of electronic equipment (referred to here as a voltage-clamp device) to hold the membrane voltage at a desired level (the command voltage) while measuring the current that flows across the cell membrane at that voltage. The voltage-clamp device uses a negative feedback circuit to control the membrane voltage. To do this, the equipment measures the membrane voltage and compares it with the command voltage set by the experimenter. If the measured voltage is different from the command voltage, an error signal is generated and this tells the voltage-clamp device to pass current through an electrode in the neuron in order to correct the error and set the voltage to the command level. This can be accomplished using two microelectrodes inserted into the cell, one to measure voltage and another to pass current (see Figure Below), or using one large-diameter electrode that performs both functions.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128153208000041-f04-10-9780128153208.jpg?_)\n\n> Figure Description : The two-electrode voltage-clamp technique.\n> This diagram depicts the circuit that is used to clamp the voltage of a neuron and measure the current that flows at that membrane voltage."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For more about Ion channels understanding please check this research paper : [Voltage Clamp](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/voltage-clamp) , this nature publication [Deep-Channel uses deep neural networks to detect single-molecule events from patch-clamp data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0729-3) and also this beautiful EDA kernel : [Ion Switching Competition : Signal EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/tarunpaparaju/ion-switching-competition-signal-eda)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"as from this kernel [One Feature Model](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/one-feature-model-0-930) we get to know that The training data is recordings in time.
