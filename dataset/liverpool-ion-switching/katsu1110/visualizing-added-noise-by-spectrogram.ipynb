The aim was to clearly visualize the nature of the added noise and see if there is any correlation between Fourier features of the signal and the open channels. If the noise is a pure white noise where the power is equal across different frequencies, we don't have a high hope to use some Fourier features to make a good prediction. If there is a systematic pattern in the noise, well, let's think about what we can do:) "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy import signal\nfrom scipy.fft import fftshift\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm\n\n# visualize\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.style as style\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import ScalarFormatter\nsns.set_context(\"talk\")\nstyle.use('fivethirtyeight')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's load the data and split it into the 10 separate measurement sequences.
