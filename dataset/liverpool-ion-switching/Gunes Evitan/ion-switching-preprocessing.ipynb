Introduction**\nCompetition data has only three features `signal`, `time` and `open_channels`. `open_channels` is the target and `signal` is the only predictor. It is a very small dataset in terms of features and samples.\n\n> **IMPORTANT**: While the time series appears continuous, the data is from discrete batches of 50 seconds long 10 kHz samples (500,000 rows per batch). In other words, the data from 0.0001 - 50.0000 is a different batch than 50.0001 - 100.0000, and thus discontinuous between 50.0000 and 50.0001.\n\nThis is a very important detail to consider. Every **500,000** samples are coming from different batches. Data analysis and feature engineering should be done on batches independently.\n\nCompetition test data is split by 3/7.
