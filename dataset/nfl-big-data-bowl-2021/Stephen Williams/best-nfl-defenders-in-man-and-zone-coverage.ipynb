{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this analysis was to try to determine when a defence applies man or zone defences based on player tracking data, and then analysing the effectiveness of these defensive strategies against various offensive formations. A deeper dive was then done to break it down to the individual player level, to see which defenders play the tightest coverage, and how defenders stack up generally when they are operating in zone or man defence. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Man vs Zone Coverage\n\nHow can we tell from the data when a defender is in man or zone coverage? Whilst there are many possible different defensive play calls which do not fit neatly in the category of strictly all man or all zone, this analysis attempted to approach this question by looking at the individual defensive players and measure the distance between them and the closest receiver to them (presumed to be the opponent they are marking up against) at each event from the beginning of the play snap up until the point when the pass arrives. If their marked opponent (the receiver) did not change throughout the whole play up until the pass arrived, it was assumed therefore that this defensive player was in a man coverage. \n\nThe Free Safety position was left out of this however and assumed to be playing in some type of zone coverage at the back. Players categorised were therefore CBs, LBs and SSs. The code used to run this is included below (the code has been commented out to reduce runtime. Final results will be explored further on in the notebook).\n\nThis code returns a summary of all defensive players on the field at each time frame, listing the closest receiver to them and the distance between them at that point in time.
