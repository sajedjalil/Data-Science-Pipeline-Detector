Welcome to our NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 presentation. \n\nA blitz is a tactic used by the defense to disrupt pass attempts by the offense. During a blitz, a higher than usual number of defensive players will rush the opposing quarterback, in an attempt to hurry the pass. Our team defined a blitz as when four or more passrushers bring pressure to sack the quarterback or to disrupt the play. \n\nSome plays in football are more critical in determining the outcome of the game than others. Situations where a blitz occurs is considered to be one of those moments. Due to the intensive nature of a blitz, NFL teams may find useful insights when analyzing the specific instances where blitzes occur and seeing what variables contribute to the overall defensive success. \n\nIn this project, we analyze interesting relationships between the blitz and other features to figure out the optimum instances of when blitzes are most successful. This information will be highly valuable to NFL teams as they will be able to use this in live game situations based on the features we have identified. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Pre-installed Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import pandas and numpy for data analysis\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Import Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n#Regular Expressions\nimport re\n\n#Warning Messages Control\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n#Handle Date Time Convertions between pandas and matplotlib\nfrom pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters\nregister_matplotlib_converters()\n\n# Use white grid plot background from seaborn\nsns.set(font_scale=1.5, style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#We are using the Bayesian Method \nplt.style.use('bmh')\n\n#We automatically generate the EDA using the Pandas_profiling package\nimport pandas_profiling","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"##This gives the maximum columns in a pandas dataFrame.

One of the main challenges when defining whether a blitz is successful or not is figuring out how exactly to quantify success. While a sack is oftentimes one of the easiest and most widely identified outcomes of a blitz, it is not the only outcome that is useful. This is why our team created a new category called defense success to accurately measure the success of a play. Success is defined as 1, while failure is defined as 0. \n\nFirstly, we defined success for a blitz as being when the play results in the lack of a completion. Our team did this for a couple of reasons. There are times in which a quarterback doesn't take a sack, however the result of the pressure results in an incompletion. We define this as being a success for the defense as the play didn't result in net positive yardage for the offensive. \n\nSecondly, we looked at the plays where it resulted in the yards to go being greater than the play result. This indicates to our team that the offense did not gain the necessary amount of yards that was necessary to gain a first down. We looked at those plays on thth down as this means the offensive will now either have to punt, kick a field goal, or go for it on 4th down. Each of these results is not an ideal scenario for the offensive. \n\nThirdly, we looked at plays where the play result resulted in less than 3.5 yards. Typically if an offense gains less than 3.5 yards per play, they will have reached 4th down as they won't have converted on the 3rd down. By limiting the total amount of offensive yards to less than 3.5 yards per play, a defense can successfully limit the productivity of the offense. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Defense Success\n\ndef DefenseSuccess(df):\n    #Return df if the function has been executed\n    if 'Defense_Success'in df:\n        return df \n    \n    #use 'passResult' \n    df['Defense_Success'] = np.where(df['passResult'] != 'C',1,0 )\n\n    #fourth down - playResult < yardsToGo\n    df['Defense_Success'].loc[(df['yardsToGo'] > df['playResult']) &  (df['down']==4 )] = 1\n    \n    #At least 3.5 yards per play\n    df['Defense_Success'].loc[(df['playResult']<3.5) &  (df['down']!=4 )] = 1\n\n    return df\n\nplays = DefenseSuccess(plays)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 3 - Additional Cleaning\n\nFurthermore, we cleaned the data to fill in the missing values in how the game clock was adjusted,for the possession team, the offensive formation, and dropback type.

This is interesting as the other downs were nowhere as close to being successful. Blitzes failed a majority of the time on 1st and 2nd down, and were about 50-50 split on 4th down. One of the reasons is due to 3rd down being a high pressure moment and the additional pressure of the blitz may result in more opportunities for defensive success. One may assume or expect that trend to continue on 4th down, however generally if an offensive team decides to go for it on 4th down, they only have a few yards to go before converting.

The key number that we are analyzing here is how many passrushers should the defense send to generate the highest defense success percentage. When teams sent 4 passrushers or less(not a blitz), there was less defensive success as opposed to when blizes occurred with 5 or more passrushers. One critical point to mention however, is that when 7 passrushers were sent into blitz, it had the worst defense success percentage at around only 20%. When only 6 passrushers were sent into blitz, interestingly enough, it had the highest defensive success percentage at around 60%. This indicates that a team can send too many passrushers which resulted in a bad defense success percentage, and based on our data, that number is 7. This is because when teams send passrushers to blitz, it leaves wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs more wide open because there are less defensive players covering them, as they are trying to blitz to the play. While the quarterback may have less time to throw, they may have an easier time making a play to one of their other offensive teammates, which is what the data shows. 6 is the optimal number of passrushers because it balances resources on the field between coverage of offensive players and conducting the blitz.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#numberOfPassRushers\ndf3 = pd.DataFrame(plays.groupby(['numberOfPassRushers'])['Defense_Success'].mean())\ndf3['Defense_Fail'] = 1-df3['Defense_Success']\ndf3 = df3.reset_index()\n\n#Remove 1 and 8 to avoid confusion\ndf3 = df3[2:8]\n\n#Plot\ndf3.plot(x=\"numberOfPassRushers\", y=[\"Defense_Fail\", \"Defense_Success\"], kind=\"bar\")\nplt.legend(loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))\nplt.title(\"Number of PassRushers v.s.

Based on the graph below it appears that the Houston Texas and Miami Dolphins have  the highest blitz percentage at around 50% and the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills had the lowest blitz percentage at about 10%.

While this may be counterintuitive, it actually makes a lot of sense. It is standard that there are at least 4 defensive backs, consisting of two cornerbacks and two safeties. If there are less than 4 defensive backs, it may indicate there is some sort of goal line formation where blitzes are more typical and there may be substituted linebackers on the passrush instead. Additionally, with a greater number of defensive backs at 6 or 7, not all of them may be blitzing, but some will, which is a considerable amount of pressure to put on the quarterback.
