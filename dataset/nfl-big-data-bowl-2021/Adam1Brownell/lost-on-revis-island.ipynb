Week 12 of the NFL Regular season. Finishing my weekend chores _just_ before gametime, I excitedly turn on my Carolina Panthers vs. New York Jets on the living room TV. I throw a bag of popcorn in the microwave, relax, and watch the opening kick off...\n\n... and within the first 4 minutes of play, Darrelle Revis intercepts Delhomme and returns it for a Touchdown. A Pick 6.\n\nRevis would go on to hold Steve Smith, our star receiver, to 1 catch for 5 yards on 6 targets. The Jets would go on to win 17 to 6. \n\nA Sunday ruined...\n\n--\n\nMy nightmarish memory of Darrelle Revis against my team that Sunday was not the exception, but the rule. Revis consistently dominated whomever he was matched up against; which was often future first-ballot HOFers like himself. 2009 Revis was the definition of a \"Shutdown Corner.\"\n\n![](https://i.redd.it/mj85t54nxta51.jpg)\n\nWhat is so amazing about Revis as a player is that through his career he made a name for himself for matching up against the best receivers in the league, and absolutely annihilating their offensive output. Playing man-to-man with no Safety help, he could hold receivers coming off 200+ yard games to a single catch. His notoriety for shutting down phenomenal WRs incepted the idea of Revis Island in the minds of Football Fans.\n\n> **Revis Island:** A term describing the effect Darrelle Revis had on the receivers he covered. No matter how good they were, Revis always found a way to neutralize their game impact, seemingly getting lost on the Island (Revis' career coincident with the airing of the show LOST, likely where the idea of getting lost on an island came from)\n\nAfter Revis retired after the 2017 season, I've always wondered if a CB could ever take up the mantle of Revis Island. Would there ever be a defensive player so dominant in the passing game as Revis ever again? \n\nIt is with this in mind that led me to Dat Bowl 2021: **In Search of Revis Island**. Specifically, focusing on answering these select questions:\n\n### 1. Can we quantify not just the reduction in targets and yards, but actual **Game Impact** of a defensive player?\n\n### 2. Who truly are the **Shutdown Defensive Backs** of NFL in 2018?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below is a outline of the analytics notebook, along with questions/comments addressed in each section:\n\n### PART I: SETTING THE TABLE\n**1.

Determining Coverage\n\nThe objective of this section was to determine which defensive player was covering which offensive player on every passing play from 2018. Using frame-by-frame data of distances and velocities, I was able to determine this to a relative strong degree of reliability (metrics below). \n\nWhile this process was interesting from a Data Science perspective, an extensive debrief on the subject would be tangental to this notebook's true purpose: Measuring game impact resistance of defensive players. In addition, the preprocessing required to determine coverage takes several hours, so for expediency (and saving space in this NB) I generated csv files of the data rather than include all of the code to rerun. You can absolutely check out my entire process in this [public notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adam1brownell/setting-the-table-determining-coverage).\n\nSkip to next section if more interested in insights/analytics than preprocessing"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**In a Nutshell:** \n\nI built three models: (1) play-level man/zone predictor, (2) player-level man/zone predictor, and (3) player-level coverage (offense and defense) predictor.

The features used were a mix of homebrewed values and those outlined in \"Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data\" (although the unsupervised method was not a very strong predictor in the end).

Not all Catches are Created Equal\n\nWhile the traditional DB metrics of targets, completions, and yards allowed directionally show who is a stronger/weaker defensive player, they fail to capture the critical element of **game context**. A 5 yard completion on 3rd and 2 is much worse than a 5 yard completion on 2nd and 22, even though the stat sheet would count the, as equal.

While generally increasing linearly with absolute yards gained, **Game Impact**  spikes when a play results in a Touchdown or First Down, particularly on 3rd or 4th down. Large plays on 3rd down in close games are painful for defenses, and so Game Impact captures this effect reasonably well. Conversely, large chunks of yards that have no impact on the game are dropped to 0 game impact, ensuring that garbage-time yardage does not penalize a DB.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n\n**Play #1** marked above is a 47 yard touchdown passs on 4th down with less than 2min of play left. An absolutely terrible play to give up, as a stop would likely sealed the game up; hence the Game Impact of that play is significant.\n\n**Play #2** marked above, while resulting in _more_ yards gained than Play #1, was a hail mary that did not reach the endzone before time expires. The DB on the play did his job by preventing a TD, and so the Game Impact is neutralized.\n\nThe act of weighting plays by their game context will help our later analysis separate generally good DBs from those that _almost never_ give up a big play... and hopefully reveal a few corners whose performance is actually much worse than their stats show at first glance"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"incomplete_pd = plays_pd[((plays_pd.passResult == 'I')|(plays_pd.passResult == 'IN'))&\n                         ~(plays_pd.playDescription.str.contains('sack'))&\n                         ~(plays_pd.playDescription.str.contains('PENALTY'))&\n                        ~(plays_pd.playDescription.str.contains('FUMBLE'))&\n                        ~(plays_pd.playDescription.str.contains('Intentional Grounding'))&\n                        ~(plays_pd.playDescription.str.contains('Roughness'))].copy()\n\n# If increases chance of victory \nincomplete_pd['epa_yards'] = incomplete_pd.epa+incomplete_pd.epa*(incomplete_pd.down-1)\n# incomplete_pd.loc[incomplete_pd.passResults == 'IN', 'epa_yards'] = \n\n\n# If Close Game\nincomplete_pd.loc[abs(incomplete_pd.preSnapHomeScore - incomplete_pd.preSnapVisitorScore)<=10, 'epa_yards'] = incomplete_pd.epa_yards * \\\n                                                                                                          (0.9 + incomplete_pd.quarter/10)\n\n# If RedZone\nincomplete_pd.loc[incomplete_pd.absoluteYardlineNumber <= 45, 'epa_yards'] = incomplete_pd.epa_yards * \\\n                                                                    (1 + (45-incomplete_pd.absoluteYardlineNumber)/30)\n\n\ncolor = ['green','yellow','orange','red']\ndwn = ['1st Down','2nd Down','3rd Down', '4th Down']\n\nlayout = go.Layout(\n                title='Weighting Contextually Important Incompletions',\n                paper_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)',\n                plot_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)',\n                xaxis = dict(title = 'Yards to Endzone'),\n                yaxis = dict(title = 'Game Impact', range=[-25,0.5]),\n    \n)\n\nfig = go.Figure(layout = layout)\n\nfor i in range(4):\n    d = incomplete_pd[incomplete_pd.down == i+1]\n\n    trace1 = go.Scatter(\n    x=d.absoluteYardlineNumber,\n    y=d.epa_yards,\n    text=d.playDescription,\n    name= dwn[i],\n    hoverinfo='text',\n    mode='markers',\n    marker=dict(\n        color=color[i]))\n    \n    fig.add_trace(trace1)\n\n\n\nfig.update_layout(shapes=[\n    dict(\n      type= 'line',\n      line=dict(\n        color=\"gray\",\n        width=1,\n        dash=\"dot\",\n        ),\n      yref= 'y', y0= 0, y1= 0,\n      xref= 'paper', x0= 0, x1= 1,\n    )\n    \n])\n\niplot(fig)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Just as some completions are worse coverage plays than overs, some _incompletitons_ are better defensive plays than others.

To start, along the X Axis shows the typical stat line shown for a DB-- given their WR was targetted, what is the average yards given up. At first glance, this should cleanly separate DBs by skill. However, when taking into account the game ramifications of those yards, we start to see a different picture of DB skill.\n\n_Note: Good corners would have less yards/game impact forfeit, so the bottom left section is the \"best\" section_\n\nBy cutting the dataset into quadraints, we get the following groups:\n\n### 1. Posers: Low Absolute Yards Forfeightted, but High Game Impact Allowed\nOn paper, these DBs look like very strong defensive players. But what the statline does _not_ capture is the significant game impact of these yards allowed. They may only allow a 4 yard completions, but it'll be on a 3rd and 2 in a close game. Rely on these DBs for 80% of the game, but when you really need a stop, look for a more Clutch DB to cover their WR1\n\n### 2. Busts: High Absolute Yards Forfeightted with High Game Impact Allowed\nThese DBs have had unfavorable matchups this year. For whatever reason, they have found themselves giving up big yardage plays to the deteriment of their team (and likely season). Supporting these DBs with on-field help and off-field traing is the logical remedy\n\n### 3. Bend-Don't-Breaks: High Absolute Yards Forfeightted, but Low Game Impact Allowed\nThese DBS understand that an 12 yard completion on 3rd and 15 is acceptable, even if not optimal. They may appear . Often these DBs are covering some of the most elite WRs in the league, and doing a fine job. These DBs are underrated, and despite their stat line at times, should be on the field on pivotal plays\n\n### 4. Gems: Low Absolute Yards Forgeightted with Low Game Impact Allowed\nGems look good on paper and on the field. They are excellent DBs in all situations. They rarely give up yards, and more importantly, rarely give up a big important play that gives the offense momentum. If Gems ask for a higher salary, pay them.\n\nA note on **Holton Hill**-- While seeming to be THE elite DB in the NFL in 2018 based on this graph, it is important to look at the average difficulty of match-ups. Jalen Ramsay, an excellent CB, had a much more challeneging suite of WRs to cover, whereas Hill has one on of the easiest covering duties amongst players plotted.

With the best DBs in football falling into a distinct categories, lets add some meaining and context to each of these buckets:\n\n### Cohort Descriptions: \n\n- **Impact Only:** The DBs are likely to give up yardage and catches, but know how to tighten up when it matters. They rarely give up the big play. There is likely a preference for LBs in these metrics, since LBs are often covering short routes by RBs and TEs as opposed to deep plays downfield\n\n- **Targets Only:** Playstyle likely leads to the QB avoiding this matchup unless its open, but when it is, the pass usually nets the offense a large chunk of yards. Could be indicative of inconsistent DB performance by a strong player\n\n- **Completions Only:** Usually  paired up against WRs QBs love to throw to, but often can make a good play to prevent a completion. Scoring may indicate an overcommitment to deflect/disrupt pass, which leads to big plays when missed\n\n- **Impact & Completions Only:** Often play against WRs that QBs love to throw to, even in tight coverage. Despite the high targetting rate, these DBs often make a good play on the ball. This group of DBs are high caliber\n    - **Spot Check:** It makes perfect sense that Jalen Ramsey would fall in this cateogory. We saw in our earlier analysis that he was often covering very strong WRs but did a praise-worthy job at mitigating their impact\n\n- **Impact & Targets Only:** Known to allow the receiver to get open and catch on occassion, but mostly on shorter, less meaningful routes. Typically plays tight coverage and does not give up the big play. Likely also plays against WR1 + high-target WRs less often-- perhaps consider moving them to play more difficult matchups.\n    - Spot Check: [Humphrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Humphrey) was first-team AllPro and made the ProBowl the year after this season (2019) for the first time. Maybe the Ravens _also_ saw the same potential this analysis is revealing!\n\n- **Target & Completions Only:** Does a good job covering their players most of the time, but when they get beat they get beat badly\n\n- **All Three Categories** DBs who are represent the top 10% for Target, Completion, and Impact Resistance. This segement is where all DBs should strive to be-- significantly reducing a WR's output across all meaningful metrics. While I don't have data to prove this, I would assume a HOF corner like Revis would often find their seasons stats placing them in this section."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.

These is a wide gap across both completion and impact resistance between these players and the rest of the DBs in the NFL. According to game resistance on man coverage, these are the most elite DBs in the leage. If your team is looking to gain a shutdown DB, trade for one of these players.\n\n_Note: Taron Johnson, while I'm sure an elite player, has fewer man-to-man snaps than his fellow Revis Islander. The jury is still out on his status_\n\n### Revis Explorers\nThere is an interesting cohort of DBs that also falls out of this list: DBs who have a low number of man coverage plays in 2018, but have some promising results. Particularly Anothony Brown, Adoree' Jackson, and Carlton Davis. They have started to separate themselves from the rest of the leage in terms of impact, but have a small sample size and average completion resistance. A recommendation for teams that these DBs play for is to test their mettle by playing more man coverage, ideally against WR1s, and see if they have what it takes to make it to Revis Island. Stephone Gilmore, Adoree' Jackson, and William Jackson all also fall into this category, but have a larger number of snaps. Perhaps they need some more technical help to acheive Revis-Island-status, but they clearly still have the potential!\n\n#### Interesting Specific Examples:\n\n**Janoris Jenkins** sits somewhere between the Revis Islanders and Explorers. Depending on his previous year stats, he could be trending towards Revis-Island status or dropping down out of it. Either way, he is in a year of transition it seems.\n\n**Stephon Gilmore**, the best corner in the game according to all plays is \"only\" in the Explorers grouping. The explorers are still the top 10% of corners in the league, but I would have expected him to be a Revis Islander This leads me to believe that these he is great in team defenses, but when it comes to one-on-one coverage, there are better specialists than he.\n\n**Richard Sherman** is a famous CB in football today, due to his spectacular [\"Swat Heard Round the World\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhtfaME_v0Y) in coverage against Crabtree. Before this analysis and based on that playoff moment, I assumed he was an excellemt shutdown corner. But the data shows that he is not that great in man-to-man coverage.

The elite DBs of the NFL playing against the elite WRs of the NFL.\n\nInterestingly, **Jimmy Smith** has played enough man-to-man snaps against top-10 WRs (25) to make this list. But his inclusion is welcome, because it highlights how strong the remaining 3 DBs are. **Bradberry, Ramsey, and Harden** are on Revis Island against all players, and maintain their dominance with elite WRs. These are clearly the best shutdown DBs in the leage in 2018. \n\nAn surprising element of this chart not immediately obvious that no CB that had more than 25 snaps against a top 10 WR has a negative Impact Resistance. The narrative this fits is that if you can't prove you can cover Julio Jones, they'll pull you off that matchup. \n\n**Lattimore** is an intruguing entry because he middle of the pack in terms of man-to-man coverage in general, his team trusts him to make the plays against the best in the league. And does a decent job of it too!  clearly has the potential to be the top shutdown corner in the lead, and already is almost there for elite WRs. \n\n**Marlon Humprhey**, present in Revis Island for all man-coverage plays, does not make this list, leading us to believe that perhaps he is a shutdown corner against your typical WR, but not Julio Jones and company. Or maybe he simply needs more reps against top-10 receivers, and he can prove this analysis wrong in Data Bowl 2021.\n\n### Real World Data\n\nAfter the 2019 season, Jalen Ramsey [signed a 5 year, 105million dollar contract, 71 million of it guaranteed](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29844575/rams-cb-jalen-ramsey-agree-five-year-105m-contract-agent-says). This was the largest guarantee in a contract for a DB in the history of the NFL. \n\nSome sports analysts questioned whether he was worth that much. \n\nBut using the data collected from above, Ramsey is absoltely one of THE BEST cornerbacks when it comes to shuting down tough receivers in man-to-man coverage. Which is particuarly impressive given his resume of WRs he covered in 2018. If your team is in need of a modern-day Darelle Revis, paying him a gigantic contract makes perfect sense, and the data supports this.\n\n![](https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-908463338.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion: There and Back Again\n\nLet's recap what we covered, and few interesting insights/actions uncovered:\n- **Process:** By modifying play outcome by game context and matchup difficulty, we can distill out the true **game impact** of a play. Game Impact often varies significantly from play outcome\n- **Process:** By comparing a WR's game impact acheived against a DB versus a WR's typical performance, we can capture a DB's **resistance** to forfeitting targets,completions, and game impact\n- **Insight:** While Marlon Humphrey and Tradvious White are stellar DBs, their yards stat line is not what it first appears. They give up fewer yards than average, but the yards they give up are worse than the appear. Turn to a Clutch cornerback like Denzel Ward or John Norman-- who gives up a few more yards but makes the big plays\n- **Insight:** Stephon Gilmore, while one of the strongest overall cornerbacks in the league, is not comparable to Darelle Revis in terms of shutdown man coverage. That honor is reserved for Jalen Ramsay and Marlon Humphrey\n- **Action:** If your team has a DB that is a \"Revis Explorer,\" provide them with more opportunities to play man-to-man against WR1. You may have a budding Darelle Revis on your hands!\n- **Action:** On critical plays in the game, play your most Clutch DB agaisnt their best receiver-- Ignore the statline, Cluth DBs are more likely to get a stop\n\n## Next Steps\nAka \"things I wish I could've done\"\n- I would absolutely love to run this analysis for Darelle Revis' 2009 and 2010 seasons, and see where he compares to the 2018 cohort. Would Jalen Ramsay and company be comperable? Better, worse? It would be a fun yardstick to measure success on\n- **No Man is a (Revis) Island:** Sticking with the narrative around individual-player performance, I had to scrap my analysis around team-level strength. But now that I have player-levels stats, it would be a fun exercise to explore if the best defensive teams always have the best players, or if a collection of above-average players does a better job than 1 super star\n- **Making a Revis:** A further analysis that would so fun for someone to explore is finding explanatory elements of what makes a shutdown corner. This analysis alluded to strictly output, but finding technique-related differences would be amazing to see (this would require pretty serious tracking equipment...maybe 2024)\n- **QB Games** Shaking off QBs, or messing up their reads, would be an amazing future topic. My original metric for difficulty included which read number a WR was. But we did not have QB head movement, so could not check who their first/second reads.\n- **Longitudinal Study:** Strong Football metrics can stand the test of time. Would love to see resistance scores over multiple seasons, and see how they improve/degrade for each corner back. Hopefully **Resistance** can be used to track a DBs skill across their career! I also wanted to run this on college prospects and see if it (1) translated to the pros and (2) could result in draft-prospecting strategies\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed!\n\n![](https://blog.sevenponds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/800px-Sunset_in_Zadar_2-513x344.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
