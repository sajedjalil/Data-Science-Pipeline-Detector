Because of long calculation times for even only one poition we will pick: cornerback and widereceiver in every full play (from snap till it is completely over). This demands some preparation and a lot of calculation time for the kaggle cloud 📊.\n\n#### Note: This could be done with every other pair of positions by simply chaing the letters in the script to the corresponding position.\n\n### ***Preparation:*** Mesure the distances (What this script does)\nIt takes the position of every cornerback and sorts out the position of a given widereceiver and mesures the distance for every secound of every play.\nUsing this data a list of average distances or \"coverage\" is created.\n\nOf course this is only one variable that could be used to mesure the efficiency of a cornerback, as there are many more metrics than just distance to widereceiver to take into account - for example the play situation the player is facing, where the ball is, a interception, etc.\n\n![How it works](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wwhEZBTP-nUO8uIzCkDtOMkCgOre2DpZ)\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n#takes the week data and extracts two positions to get the distance, this is the core of this analysis\ndef getPerformanceForWeek(weekNr):\n    week = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week' + str(weekNr) + '.csv')\n    week.fillna(0)\n    if not os.path.exists('./week_' + str(weekNr)):\n        os.makedirs('./week_' + str(weekNr))\n\n    week[\"new_secoud\"] = week.time.apply(lambda x: x.split(\"T\")[1].split(\".\")[0])\n    \n    #filter relevant positions\n    week_cbs = week[(week.position == \"CB\")] #(week.gameId == 2018090600) if you want to make it only for one game of week 1\n    week_wrs = week[(week.position == \"WR\")] #(week.gameId == 2018090600) if you want to make it only for one game of week 1\n\n    #group it for: play per player per week\n    week_wrs_plays = [x for _, x in week_wrs.groupby(['nflId', 'playId'])]\n    week_cbs_plays = [x for _, x in week_cbs.groupby(['nflId','playId'])]\n\n    i = 1 # for logging\n    for _refPlay in week_cbs_plays:\n        _refPlay = _refPlay.drop_duplicates(subset='new_secoud', keep=\"last\") # generates a secound based play-data-frame\n        _refPlayId = _refPlay['playId'].iloc[0]\n        shortestStartDistance = 9999;
