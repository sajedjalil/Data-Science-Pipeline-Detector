According to the *New York Times* article, [How Offense Took Over the N.F.L.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/sports/nfl-offense-records.html), teams passed the football 47% of the time in 1980. However, in the past three years, teams have averaged around a 60% passing rate. With NFL offenses passing on more plays than ever, it is imperative for teams to have lockdown cornerbacks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://nflmocks.com/wp-content/uploads/imagn-images/2017/07/15225265.jpeg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\nThe most effective cornerbacks are able to create or maintain a tight separation between himself and the target receiver at the point of pass arrival.

Data Wrangling\n\nPrior to analysis, the data was cleaned, standardized,and aggregated by play. For each play, the target receiver and closest defender were identified, along with their position, separation, speed, and orientation at the point of pass release and pass arrival.\n\nA few key notes:\n* Pass Classification: passes were classified by distance\n    * 1: distance < 10 yards\n    * 2: 10 yards <= distance <= 20 yards\n    * 3: distance > 20 yards\n    \n    \n* Difference in Separation = separationAtRelease - separationAtArrival\n    * Positive difference in separation: defender gained ground on the receiver\n    * Negative difference in separation: defender lost ground on the receiver\n    \n    \n* For the purpose of this analysis, we define cornerbacks as both \"CB\" and \"DB\". \n\n* Players with less than 30 plays were filtered out of the analysis.\n\n* Plays were filtered for all plays where a wide receiver was the target receiver and a cornerback was the closest defender.\n\n* For classification of pass_outcomes, pass_outcome_touchdown is included in pass_complete and pass_outcome_interception is included in pass_incomplete"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#

Future Directions\n\n**1. Effect of Player Load on Separation**\n\nWith the increase in availability of biometric data, many teams have begun tracking player load, a measurement of a player's work commonly calculated from acceleration data. The addition of player load data to play by play enables coaches and trainers to evaluate the effect of load on performance. With regard to cornerbacks, since we see a trend of an increase in separation as the game progresses, it is likely there is a point where player load effects the separation a cornerback is able to create or maintain. With this analysis, the coaching staff could make an informed decision on when to make a substitution or how to better manage the player's load to maintain a tight average of separation throughout the game. \n\n**2. Coverage Breakdown: Man vs. Zone**\n\nBreaking down the analysis of separation related to fatigue a step further, a cornerback's separation at arrival over time could be evaluated in a man coverage versus a zone coverage. With this analysis, a coach could better decide defensive coverage depending on defensive scheme, an opponent, or healthy personnel. Players with a strong closing speed, who can gain tightness in separation may be better suited for a zone coverage, while players who are able to maintain a tight degree of separation from pass release to arrival may be better suited for man coverage in the beginning of the game, but does that trend hold throughout the whole game?\n\n**3. Situational Breakdown**\n\nLastly, identifying trends in separation for players under certain situations may help identify effective personnel for certain game day situations. For example, in looking at end of game situations where the defense is winning in a one possession game, you may identify one cornerback who plays a tighter coverage than average to try to eliminate the pass to his receiver. On the other hand, what if a different cornerback plays a looser coverage than normal to be able to help out his teammates if needed. Which player do you go with? It may depend on the opponent, coaching staff, or other personnel on the field. However, with this information, coaches are informed on which player to choose in certain situations."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
