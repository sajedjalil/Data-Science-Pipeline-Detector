Here, we explore the importance of a defensive back's position relative to his receiver at the beginning of each play, offering some relevant, actionable insights to NFL organizations.\n\nWe chose this topic of research primarily because it is particularly actionable. There exists a wealth of research on the relevance of statistics during a play to the plays outcome or possible strategies. However, many of these plays rely on information of a play that is not known *a priori*, such as the routes of the receivers. Thus it remains a challenge to implement these research ideas in practice, especially since one defensive strategy against certain types of pass play may be completely undermined by a different one.\n\nWe have not seen much work done on exploring how defenders line up at the beginning of the play, but we believe that insights on this matter can be directly implemented during the games *without loss of generality*, which makes it of particular value to organizations.\n\nThus the goal of our work is to determine the most influential factors in different coverage types (position of the defensive back). Knowing this information would allow defensive coaches to determine the most favorable coverage matchups in a certain situation, for any type of defensive position they take. \n\nWe subset this notebook submission into a few main sections for clarity and organization. At each technical step of our work, we offer analysis and interpretation of key figures/results, building to a few key conclusions and recommendations proposed at the end of the notebook. Source code is typically hidden, but can be expanded for detailed viewing.\n\n\nMany of the intermediate analyses depend on somewhat long scripts, so we have implemented them as external functions to make the code in the body of the report more readable and concise. All the functions not explicitly implemented in the body will be included in the Appendix, sorted by alphabetical order by function name.

Breaking down their play by coverage type and alignment is even better, as man vs zone schemes and slot vs wide alignment are all fundamentally different. Going a step further, however, previous studies ([FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-new-metric-shows-how-good-nfl-receivers-are-at-creating-separation/), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-nfls-new-pass-defense-metric-can-and-cant-tell-us/)) have found it helpful to break down their play by Press Type. This allows us to separate off coverage from tight bump-and-run coverage, which again are fundamentally different techniques and situations. \n\nWhile evaluating a defender's press coverage ability could take hours of film study and can be subjective at times, tracking data can provide the same insight during just the first seconds of the play ([MaddenGuides](https://www.maddenguides.com/press-normal-and-soft-coverage/)) Shown below, the cornerback successfully limits the receiver using this technique to slow down the timing of the receiver running the route. \n\n![](https://images.actionnetwork.com/blog/2018/11/brad.gif)\n\nThis form of coverage is largely dependent on the distance between the defender and the receiver for the duration of the play. As such, we are motivated to further pursue this separation distance in the broader context of quantifying pass defender performance. As we see in our exploratory data analysis, this separation can be made in both the *x* and *y* axes, defined as shown below (from the competition page).\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3258%2F820e86013d48faacf33b7a32a15e814c%2FIncreasing%20Dir%20and%20O.png?generation=1572285857588233&alt=media)\n\nWe will refer to the *x* and *y* axes in this way throughout the report.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exporatory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nWe begin by exploring the given data regarding pass distances to see if there are any surface-level underlying features driving pass distance, which would in turn influence pass coverage."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\n# Loading in all the raw datasets we will use here\npass_plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv\")\npass_plays = pass_plays[pass_plays['playType'] == \"play_type_pass\"]\nplayers = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv\")\nall_plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv\")\n\n\n\n# Setting global parameters to make the plots look nicer\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.rcParams[\"axes.spines.right\"] = False\nmpl.rcParams[\"axes.spines.top\"] = False\nmpl.rcParams['axes.linewidth'] = 2\nmpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 12\nmpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 12\nmpl.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 12\nmpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 12\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are interested in exploring the role of defender starting position in a given pass play.

Even though there is a slightly different variance between the two, the fact that they have zero mean and Gaussian shape suggests that any differences can be confidently attributed to noise.\n\nThus we focus our attention solely towards positioning on the x-axis (left figure). Fortunately, we have a good way of describing this type of positioning in the context of a real football game. These distances fall into one of three categories (press, medium, soft coverages). Additionally, the figure above suggests that defensive backs who start closer to the receiver in a typical play may do better in preventing a completed pass, but this is only an associative effect. The causality and certainty of such a claim will be explored in great depth throughout the rest of this analysis. \n\nWe also wish, here, to be concrete about what we would consider to be a \"press\", \"normal\", or \"soft\" coverage.

Another benefit of this model was that it easily provides us with a measure of how important a feature is as well as the direction of association.

The biggest factor is the average separation when the ball is thrown. More separation means a completion is more likely.\n\n2. In normal coverage, most of the weights are less significant than average separation. However, the defender's max speed has a positive weight while the defender's average speed has a negative weight. This suggests that a defender will be unsuccessful (high catch probability for the receiver) if they are more changes in speed / direction, situations which cause the defender to slow down. This suggests that a hitch route will be successful against normal coverage.\n\n3. The defender's distance ran varies greatly in the three cases. In soft coverage, the weight is large and negative. In normal coverage, the weight is near 0. In press coverage, the weight is large and positive. This is indicative of that in soft coverage, defender running far means they have time to recover the separation the receiver starts with. In press coverage, the defender running far means the receiver has time to create separation. \n\n4. The distance the defender and receiver ran are both important for soft coverage (the distance the receiver ran is only weighted heavily in soft coverage). A receiver needs to run further than the defender (and in the process creating separation) for an overall net zero contribution from these inputs. This also suggests that a defender does not need to move as far to be successful in soft coverage. \n\n5. The longer a play goes, the less likely it is to be a completion (may be indicative of a quarterback scrambling). Time of play has more of an effect on press coverage, which is tied to closer (likely man) coverages where if receivers aren't open after a few seconds then the quarterback may simply throw the ball away or be sacked."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Analysis of Special Cases\n\nHere we study, for each type of coverage, one particular play which has a very low catch probability.

High average separation (represents a successful soft coverage, maintaining a cushion of space until the ball is thrown so as not to get beat). \n3. The defender's average speed was lower than the receiver's average speed, although the max speeds were similar, signifying that the defender made up ground only when the RB entered the appropriate zone. The orientation also allows us to understand that this was likely a zone coverage. \n\n#### Conclusions\nFor soft coverage, a defensive back should not commit to a receiver too early, but need the speed to catch up if the receiver chooses to accelerate.

The key variables that contributed to this low catch probability are: \n\n1. Fairly low separation in the air (given the speeds, this is significant)\n2. Extremely high average defender speed (only slightly lower than receiver metric)\n3. The maximum defender speed was not vastly different than the average speed, meaning that the defender maintained the high speed and was not beaten on something like a double move. \n\nThe defender's speed was what made the model predict low catch probability even though the defender had to run a large distance.\n\n#### Conclusions\nPress coverage is successful when the defender is fast and can respond quickly to the situation. In this play, the defender is able to change direction extremely quickly, which is significant because he starts very close to his receiver and cannot afford to get beat."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pred_press = clf_press.predict_proba(X_test_press)[:,1]\n\nworst = np.argpartition(pred_press, 10)[6]\n\nprint (\"Low catch probability (press coverage): {prob:.2f}%\".format(prob=pred_press[worst] * 100))\n\nworst_play = list(zip(desired_cols, list(scaler_press.inverse_transform(X_test_press[worst]))))\n_, worst_separation = worst_play[0]\nplay_id = 3613\ngame_id = 2018091610\n\nprint (list(all_plays[(all_plays['playId'] == play_id) & (all_plays['gameId'] == game_id)]['playDescription'])[0])\n\nall_defenders[all_defenders['avg_separation'] == worst_separation]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusions\n\nIn this report, we motivate and perform an analysis on the starting defender's position during a pass play. We begin by showing why this is an important problem to study and how the problem is significantly nuanced. We heuristically define three types of coverage which depends on this metric: press, normal, and soft. Then, we demonstrate that a high amount of the variance regarding whether a pass is completed can be explained by the feature set we propose. Using sensitivity analysis, we build logistic models for each of the play types and study which features increase and decrease in importance in each model. Using a cross-validated logistic model, we then are able to show what types of plays might be successful for each type of pass, which allows to make suggestions based on what attributes of a certain type of coverage are important.\n\nImportantly, we find what makes a certain type of coverage (especially press v.s. soft) successful **depends on different criteria** (listed above), which teams should look into depending on the defensive coverage scheme they wish to use. Further research could be done with regards to formalizing these criteria to do some form of probabilistic analysis how they empirically affect the catch probability."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Appendix\nThis contains the function files for all the codes used in this report"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def angle_diff (ang1, ang2):\n    \"\"\"Given two angles from 0 to 360, find the difference between the angles, ranging from -180 to 180\"\"\"\n    diff = ang1 - ang2\n    if diff < -180:\n        diff += 360\n    elif diff > 180:\n        diff -= 360\n    return diff\n\ndef ball_thrown_to(play):\n    \"\"\"Given a play, figure out to whom the ball is thrown to, by checking the closest receiver to \n    the football at the 'pass_arrived' frame, which exists for every throw.\"\"\"\n    \n    \n    pass_arrived = play[play['event'] == 'pass_arrived']\n    football = pass_arrived[pass_arrived['displayName'] == \"Football\"]\n    \n    receivers = find_all_receivers(play)\n    closest_receiver = np.float(\"NaN\")\n    mindist = 100\n    for rec in receivers:\n        dist = distance(pass_arrived, rec, 0) \n        if dist < mindist:\n            mindist = dist\n            closest_receiver = rec\n    return closest_receiver \n\ndef distance(play, id1, id2):\n    \"\"\"For a given play, given the id's of two players, calculate the average distance per frame\n    b/w them through the entire play.
