The DB Position Group includes Safeties (S, FS, SS) and Cornerbacks (CB). DBs dominate when they effectively shut down their Receivers, cause an incomplete pass, turnover, intercept the ball, etc. For example, see[ this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcFi07b12jY) to hear former Philadelphia Eagles Safety Malcolm Jenkins break down some tactics that make for a successful Safety.\n\nHere is a summary of my project's outcomes for evaluating Defensive Back (DB) Domination for the [NFL Data Bowl 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/overview) and [data provided](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/data) on drop-back pass plays for the 2018 Regular Season.

We need a defense category added!\n\nI took a [machine learning approach to my analysis rather than a statistical one ](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-actual-difference-between-statistics-and-machine-learning-64b49f07ea3) in order to dive deeper in my knowledge of ML concepts, practice implemention, and to challenge myself to make repeatable predictions of DB performance, which can be assessed by # Completions VS # Incompletion (and Interceptions) of the guarded Target Receiver on offense. \n\nAdditionally, focusing on the 2018 regular season data, which is season data that teams may potentially have access to real-time in the future, can help me figure how this data can actually be used throughout the season by the League, Defensive Coordinators, teams, and individual players.\n\n\n# Notable Engineered Features, Visualizations, & Data Formatting\n\nI used Python to create the following notable engineered features and visualizations. Before getting to this point, I conducted Research (see Appendix A - Research) and started formatting the data (see Appendix B - Data Formatting for more details and full code on Github [here](https://github.com/klordi/lordi_nfl_big_data_bowl_2021)).

Normalized DB Separation Visualization\nFor input to the Machine Learning XGBoost Trees to classify pass outcome as Complete (0,C) or Incomplete (1,I), I thought that it would be beneficial to normalize the positions defenders and the football to the target receiver at (x,y) = (0,0) to see how these normalized positions change over the course of the play at critical events in the play such as:\n- Ball_Snap \n- Pass_Forward (moment ball leaves the QB's hands)\n- Pass_Arrived (moment ball arrives at Target Receiver)\n- Pass_Outcome (Caught, Touchdown, or Incomplete)\n- Time Intervals after Pass_Outcome_Caught to assess how well DBs stop Receivers gaining yardage after a catch (Future Work)\n- Time Intervals between each \n\nThen, I visualized the positions of DBs relative to the Normalized Target Receiver using a [Hexagonal Bin Plot](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/hexagonal-binning/#:~:text=Hexagonal%20binning%20plots%20density%2C%20rather,the%20area%20of%20the%20hexagons.&text=There%20are%20many%20reasons%20for,2D%20surface%20as%20a%20plane.). Hexagonal Binning is useful because it shows density of the points, so we can see where more DBs tend to position themselves around the target receiver on Successful Completions (C) VS Incompletions (I). I binned the densities by log base 2 in order to make the color pop.\n\nIn the figures below, the plots show the target receiver in blue at the origin and the densities of how often DBs position themselves on ALL PLAYS IN 2018 around them for Completions (Figure 3) and Incompletions (Figure 4) at distances of 2, 5, and 10 yards away from the target receiver. What we can see from comparing the figures is that for Completions, more DBs are behind target receiver and the direction of the ball. This makes sense since receivers are more likely to make a completion when they're open and don't have a defender in between them and the QB. \n\nQuestions: Can we further query on orientation of defenders? can we label each chart better? I feel like some fancy math can be done to better quantify this. Make it a % so that it is even across data since there are way more completions than incompetions?

For example, the league and Next Gen Stats can report a metric called *DB Separation Rank* (or rename it something better), a new Next Gen Stat under a new Defensive Stats Category, which assesses and ranks DBs by how well a DB they cover receivers at critical points during play action such as pass_arrived and pass_forward (the moment the QB throws the ball). By creating more in-depth stats beneath this category named *DB Separation Zone Rank* and  *DB Separation Man Rank* for example that query on data such as defensive coverage, target receiver's route, yards to touchdown to quantify the amount of space available to defend on the field, down, etc., one can identify how well certain DBs and teams perform in a variety of:\n* Game Scenarios: Down, # yards to 1st down, # yards to touchdown, type dropback by QB, weather, etc.\n* Offensive Formations and Strategies: Route run by receiver, offensive formation, \n* Defensive Formations and Strategies: Defense Coverage Scheme (ie. Cover 0-6, Man VS Zone), individual player tendencies and skillsets \n\nFor example, this data can be used to assist with watching game film in prep for the week to determine what defensive strategies / skillsets need to be optimized in the gameplan and during practice to help with root cause analysis of how specific DBs can best limit separation in different game scenarios and defensive schemes."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1C.

For example, based on a DBs depth, position, speed, acceleration, etc. following the catch by the receiver, how many yards is the receiver likely to gain? Analyzing this is another beast. \n* Assess certain special skills that successful DBs employ depending on factors such as Game Scenario, Offensive Scheme, and Defensive Coverage. For example, like I said at the start of this notebook, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcFi07b12jY) to hear former Philadelphia Eagles Safety Malcolm Jenkins break down tactics that make for a successful Safety. Also, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6kYFFoVOp4) to hear  CB Xavier Rhodes breakdown his technique. \n* So much more it's football. \n\n### Machine Learning Model\n* Investigate classifying defensive coverages (Cover 0-6, Nickel, Dime, Quarters, etc.) using supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods. This can help enhance current XGBoost Model to Classify Pass Outcome. \n* Investigate classifying a play as Man VS Zone as players move around field over time.
