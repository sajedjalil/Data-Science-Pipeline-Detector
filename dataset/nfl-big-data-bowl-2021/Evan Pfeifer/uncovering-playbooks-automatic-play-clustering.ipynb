One can simply use existing NFL dataset fields such as offensive formation or defenders in the box to improve play efficacy knowledge. However, these fields contain more coarse information and may not offer key insight into play performance.\n\nWe contribute a novel data mining method that automatically determines a set of offensive and defensive play type categories based on the movement of the players and the football. In summary, we transform offensive and defensive player movement from each play into trajectories in higher dimensional space and cluster them into similar play categories.\n\nOur data mining method populates two new columns in the Plays table: offensive play category and defensive play category. Parameters allow for finer or coarser play categories, so that one can delve into the nuances of player movement. This is an improvement over exisiting dataset fields such as defensive formation since our new play categories offer richer and more detailed information.\n\nWe essentially uncover the playbook, both offensive and defensive, for all teams."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Mining Method\nSeveral steps, listed below, are involved in mining offensive and defensive play categories from player movement data.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize each play**<br>\n(i) Rotate players and the football in each play such that the offense always moves toward the same direction.<br>\n(ii) Translate players and football so that the first frame has the football starting at coordinate (0,0).\n\n**Step 2: Determine all the unique offensive and defensive player role sets for all plays**<br>\nEach offensive or defensive play contains a set of player positions/roles. We identify all unique player role sets. As an example, for offense there were 13305 plays with the player role set of (QB, RB, TE, WR, WR2).\n\nIf two players have the same role, append an incremental number (e.g. WR, WR2) starting at top of field, and sort ascending.\n\n**Step 3: For each play compute an offensive trajectory and a defensive trajectory in higher dimensional space**<br>\nA trajectory in d-dimensional space is sourced from the normalized player position table and is a matrix of rows (frames) and columns (player x/y coordinates). Each row corresponds to a trajectory vertex and the number of columns represents the size of the d-dimensional space. For example, an offensive play with 100 frames and player role set of (QB, RB, TE, WR, WR2, FTBL) will have a corresponding trajectory matrix of 100 rows and 12 columns (QB has two columns for x and y, RB has two columns for x and y, etc). In this example, the trajectory is in 12-dimensional space.\n\n**Step 4: Create clusters**<br>\nFor each offensive and defensive player role set, obtain the underlying trajectories, and then cluster them into *k* clusters, stopping when the radius of the largest cluster is less than *m* (in our experiments we set *m* to 1000, which results in clusters that have visually similar player movement). A larger m results in coarser play categories, and a smaller m results in more refined play categories.\n\nEach offensive and defensive play cluster is assigned a unique ID, which are used to populate the offensive play category and defensive play category in the Plays table. So, play categories represent clusters of similar plays.\n\nWe use the [Gonzalez (1985)](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271538/1-s2.0-S0304397500X05245/1-s2.0-0304397585902245/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQDGfxpaGACnccvlqmpBdBRqDVHIiZ8X3lCBJ4S%2FDgNAeAIhAK8%2FMI4ZT7dq9aFBS%2FlC36OKGKp8AiF4uO%2B5XVWJ7eo5KrQDCDoQAxoMMDU5MDAzNTQ2ODY1Igxf0fq1SH3J5xaye7EqkQOu%2BpyLPBjl121xWljCYSHdsxvc0puui3sbthzaX5t7s9eiPR0FSXnng4KjDMnKlIWU5p6bmaS%2Bu1%2B97sP1BXUNBoqEKehWGfbau%2B3xVNHOVfPpac%2BHmLlQmVjHAlvulFKJcrJFcaPCHTMyXbqtN%2FsuKMB%2FHAbLp2cyAkTfFo4pn4WY3h1RXE1rlkXDMdoAlC2P6TNcmGDcy%2FxR2ZeptaTO9IBsnzrYBX%2F%2BCWfeE2oYC9tydFlOb2FwgaLRtL110CQZNuUezxmncqlXJoCEb2RFpcYkHfqIqNeLZeYXLaYpsJZ6hDuohZgImZUfSu%2FMBLMkqIJ%2BEm5z9GC3C4A3wOmCsvfv2Ae1TLr6v8vogCd6fOWsEH8xSgE1et5QOQBCQIShhxX8oC28lvh7S9NondhhOaNzWvpfwVc27PH2Jyy%2FlVIhZsvRG%2BLtooN4vC2AxA5Fd3QS1fixVEF7XM3pMeeGd8Owwt7Bc%2FfHL572evpNFT7hm79wfeU4SLJXqUSW68J17nGnGZYq%2FF6nU90J%2BhNmFjC8t9n%2FBTrqAZjuSa4ZByPcfgFkJyh6gOR5DhGjmFVfUfXqBSx%2FuXUrXCu143G2aIZ0ZghC%2B33G0sCGQf3LyMRCi7P%2BsNCoka6WSnl7rJ17DHoq94hF1JcbMqjc9rwJJPEZeBFubpfESACS%2FgqL5Ly8U2bCuTbXDiZBCSM7QBQfIJeKubnvrPjZ8jsMB9xuqIO1URnZGN2wyJKIniBXHeRWtbjOesN5lxQLBEOUqaXklQIVseZsTndy4KRPXr9fBUulb53YmGlhsGGVosI4j9R%2FodsnInv9X%2BFrXNgqiO78PZSLzSSmAHbYtQ58Phy1KpoILA%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20210107T012913Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYTJKIFFML%2F20210107%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=304481e7a552dad5232e21f4abe2b3e59bb0832ecb045f4d21826150b69d3439&hash=696736a59b490f986429d934a6ab3ca98ddd680ca2a0944690a1f5db659a0c09&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=0304397585902245&tid=spdf-bc85b58f-90ee-4086-8401-9dbeecb72201&sid=66ebbdbe8fe9294e38791ed7a4f0aa32eb98gxrqa&type=client) clustering algorithm, since it produces clusters that have radii at most two times the optimal cluster radii. We use the Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) [Keogh et al. (2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225230134_Exact_indexing_of_dynamic_time_warping) distance measure to compute distances between trajectories since it can smooth individual player outlier movement.\n\n**Outliers**<br>\nWe exclude outlier offensive/defensive player role sets and outlier offensive/defensive clusters, i.e. exclude those that have few plays associated with them. All visuals presented only contain data from clusters that contain at least ten different plays.\n\n**Cluster Creation Speedup**<br>\nThe DTW algorithm runtime is quadratic in the number of trajectory vertices (frames), which can be computationally expensive for larger trajectories. We simplify the trajectories (reduce the vertices) using a straightforward linear-time algorithm by [Driemel et al. (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221589940_An_algorithmic_framework_for_segmenting_trajectories_based_on_spatio-temporal_criteria). This results in much faster preprocessing runtimes.\n\nOur simplification error for the experiments is 3 yards, which results in much smaller trajectories that still describe the movement well.\n\n**Cluster Example**<br>\nFor proof of concept, the algorithm clustered two defensive plays shown below into the same play category. Visually, it is easy to verify that the two plays are quite similar.\n\nWe used functions from [Rob Mulla's notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/nfl-big-data-bowl-plotting-player-position) to visualize plays."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(\"../input/nflvisuals/CINvsPIT.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(\"../input/nflvisuals/DALvsDET.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Experiments using new play categories"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Overview\n\nWe first consider which categories had the best and worst outcomes for both ofensive and defensive plays, measured by the yards gained by the offensive team.
