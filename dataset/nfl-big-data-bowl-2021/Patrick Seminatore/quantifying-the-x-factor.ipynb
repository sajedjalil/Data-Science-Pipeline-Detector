Part of the reason for this is that factors for success are different at every level of the sport.  In college, a player can dominate simply because he is able to physically outclass his competition.  However, once you get to the NFL, almost every player has elite physical tools.  Especially on defense, where the game is based around disrupting the other team's plan, the game becomes much more complex than simply being stronger or faster than your opponent.  Thus, the determining factor in a defender's success in pass defense must be some other X-Factor.

The idea is that each player must make the plays he is responsible for making, no more and no less.  What does this mean in terms of pass coverage? Sure, each defensive scheme might prescribe a zone to defend or a man to guard, but pass defense is not as simple as just being in a specific area or standing near a receiver.  In our estimation, the \"job\" of each defender is to make sure that as many attempted passes as possible fall incomplete.  Of course, another element of successful pass defense is dissuading the pass from even being thrown in the first place, but we can save that for further investigation.  \n   \n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# True Completion Percentage Allowed\nDue to the variety of defensive schemes utilized by NFL teams, it can be difficult to quantify exactly how effective defenders are at making sure passes are not completed.  A statistic that is often used is *Completion Percentage Allowed As Closest Defender*.  However, particularly in zone coverage, two defenders could easily be close enough to the receiver to make a play on the ball, and should be credited as such.  To account for this, we are going to borrow a concept from another NFL Big Data Bowl Submission (*that has since been deleted*): **Radius of Influence**.  The idea is that there is a given area on the field that each defender can realistically influence, based on how far away the defender is from the ball.

For a quick overview of how multivariate linear regression works, take a look at [this](http://mezeylab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/labmembers/documents/supplement%205%20-%20multiple%20regression.pdf) paper from Dr. Martina Bremer. At a high level, all we are attempting to do is construct the formula: \n\n$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + ... + \\beta_nx_n + \\epsilon$$\n\nWhere *y* in this case is the predicted TCPA, each *x* is one of our *n* number of input features, with a corresponding $\\beta$ as the *regression coefficient* (the weight applied to each *x* to make the model fit), $\\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of our line, and $\\epsilon$ represents the residual terms of the model.  This $\\epsilon$ is what we would like to minimize to obtain a more accurate model given our parameters.  We will use a metric called *mean squared error (mse)* to approximate the average error for the model across all data points.  \n\nNow, we can plug in our input variables.  We will be using:\n\n* **Top Speed** - The player's highest recorded speed in the provided tracking data.\n* **Max Acceleration** - The player's highest recorded acceleration in the provided tracking data.  This also effects a player's explosiveness and change of direction.\n* **Height** - The player's reported height in the provided dataset.\n* **Weight** - The player's reported weight in the provided dataset.\n* **Age** - The player's age based on reported birthdate as of Sept. 1st of 2018.  This also acts as a proxy for a player's experience.  \n\nThus, the equation for our model will be of the form:\n\n$$TCPA = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(TopSpeed) + \\beta_2(MaxAccel) + \\beta_3(Height) + \\beta_4(Weight) + \\beta_5(Age) + \\epsilon$$\n\nWhich will allow us to predict the TCPA based on raw physical characteristics.

There must be some other factor that needs to be accounted for.  This makes sense, as there is obviously more to football than just raw physical characteristics.   Unfortunately, we run into the problem here of simply not having enough information.  There is just too much that goes into defending a pass to calculate from the information we have been given.  \n\nSince we already know the TCPA for each player, we can actually quantify how far our model's predictions are from the expected result.  Recall the $\\epsilon$ from our regression equation.  This is the *error*, or difference between the projected result and the expected result.  Since we know we are missing some sort of feature for each player, we can deduce that the feature and it's coefficient must be a part of that error.
