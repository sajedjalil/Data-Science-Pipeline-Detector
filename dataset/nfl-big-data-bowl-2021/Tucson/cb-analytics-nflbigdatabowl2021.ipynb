{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### This notebook aims to employ player tracking data to tackle two main questions:\n- Which cornerbacks are the best at closely tracking receivers as they try to get open before the ball is thrown? \n- Which cornerbacks are the best at closing on receivers when the ball is in the air?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, we developed a simple score for evaluating cornerbacks' performance on each of the following events during a play: \n- from 'ball snap' to 'pass forward' (before the ball is thrown)\n- from 'pass forward' to the next non-None event in the play (ball is in the air). \n\nThis score consists of two components: personal ability and coverage ability, where each component is measured by simple and related metrics defined in terms of player tracking data on different plays.\n\n**Personal ability** is used to measure how good a cornerback is, which is composed of three related metrics as follows:\n- agility is used to measure the ability to change direction of a cornerback during a play, which is defined by the mean of the maximum direction changing of a cornerback on consecutive timestamps during different plays\n- speed is used to measure the fastest speed the cornerback can run, which is defined by the mean of the maximum speed of a cornerback during different plays\n- acceleration is used to measure a rate at which a cornerback will reach his fastest speed, which is defined by the mean of the maximum acceleration changing of a cornerback on consecutive timestamps during different plays\n\nThe personal ability is computed by weighted sum of these three metrics, whose weights are assigned subjectively with respect to importance and the nature of the event being considered\n\n**Coverage ability** is used to measure how good a cornerback can cover the closest offensive player during a play, which is composed of six related metrics as follows:\n- distance tracking is used to measure the ability to get close to his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the mean of the mean distance between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n- speed tracking is used to measure the ability to match his speed toward the speed of his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the mean of the mean different speed between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n- acceleration tracking is used to measure the ability to match his accerelation toward the acceleration of his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the mean of the mean different acceleration between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n- orientation tracking is used to measure the ability to match his orientation toward the orientation of his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the mean of the mean different orientation between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n- direction tracking is used to measure the ability to match his direction toward the direction of his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the mean of the mean different direction between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n- persuit is used to measure the ability of a cornerbak in closing in his responsible offensive player, which is defined by the closest distance and the time used to reach the closest distance between a cornerback and the closest offensive player during different plays\n\nNote that we consider to use only plays that the mean distance between a cornerback and the closest offensive player is smaller than a given threshold to compute these six metrics as this condition indicates that at least one offensive player is covered by the cornerback\n\nThe coverage ability is computed by weighted sum of these six metrics, whose weights are assigned subjectively with respect to importance and the nature of the event being considered\n\nThe score used to evaluate cornerback's performance is computed by weighted sum of personal and coverage abilities, whose weights are assigned with respect to importance and the nature of the event being considered\n\nHere, we hypothesize that some cornerbacks may perform better than others in closely tracking recievers before the ball is thrown. Some may perform better than others during the ball is in the air. By combining the scores computed from both events, we may be able to pinpoint the best cornerbacks in the game.\n\nWe present the usefulness of the devloped score through experiments on a small set of examples containing a few best cornerbacks in 2018 and a larger set of examples containing first 40 cornerbacks selected from the 'players.csv'
