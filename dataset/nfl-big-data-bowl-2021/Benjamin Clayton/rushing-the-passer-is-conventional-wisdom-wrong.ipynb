When exploring one idea we discovered a simple, yet significant, outcome. Could the [Conventional Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom) of defensive play callers truly be this different to the reality presented by the data?\n\nThe analysis has been written as a narrative, so it is recommended you don't just skip to the end.\n\nCan you spot the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)\">Easter Egg</a> associated with the colour scheme?\n\n\n# Summary\n\nThe reality presented by the data does not agree with the Conventional Wisdom of rushing 4 players the majority of the time. Although progress should be cautious and gradual, defensive play callers should look to significantly change the amount they use different numbers of rushers. They should reduce the amount they rush 4 players and should show a greater preference for rushing 5 and 6."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Assumptions\n\nFor our analysis we rely upon the [EPA (Expected Points Added)](https://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/home/stats/stats-explained/expected-points-and-epa-explained) value for each play. The power of this metric is how it allows us to [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlling_for_a_variable) for other variables that we are not considering in our analysis. It also allows us to determine binary classifications for which plays are a 'success' for the defence (i.e. a negative EPA-value) and which ones are a 'failure' (i.e. a positive EPA-value). As the EPA-values are supplied from the NFL with the dataset we are confident in their accuracy, however this assumed accuracy is a fundamental assumption of our analysis.\n\nIt is also important to remember these conclusions are drawn from the dataset of *passing plays* only (as this was the only data supplied by the NFL).

If so, it may be worth going back a few steps having a quick refresh.\n\nSo what does this final plot tells us? \n\nBegin by considering the **'Reward'** subplot. As with the first Monte Carlo analysis, the *'Best'* bars show that the ***reward*** increases with increased numbers of rushers. But the additional results of this analysis allow us to look deeper than this. From the *'Second-best or better'* bars, we can also see that the trend of increasing ***reward*** with more rushers continues. This trend flattens off (and reverses slightly) when considering the *'Third-best or better'* bars, which demonstrates the higher ***risk*** associated with higher numbers of rushers.\n\nWe can consider risk further with the second **'Risk'** subplot. As would be expected from Conventional Wisdom, if we just consider the *'Worst'* bars, they show that rushing 4 players poses the lowest ***risk***, followed by 3 rushers, with 5 and 6 rushers being approximately the same. However, if we now consider the *'Third-best or worse'* and *'Second-best or worse'* bars we can see that the opposite trend exists: *the higher the number of rushers, the lower the* ***risk***.\n\nHence, we have shown that. \n* Rushing more players gives a higher chance of achieving the ***best*** outcome\n* The Conventional Wisdom of rushing 4 players the majority of the time gives the highest chance of avoiding the ***worst*** outcome\n* **But**, rushing more players reduces the risk of the ***second-worst*** and ***third-worst*** outcomes (a bit mind-bending to think about, heh?)\n\nWe have demonstrated there is a huge gap between the frequency of each number of rushers used by defensive play callers and the reality of their impacts on the game. Hence, we draw a \nquite radical conclusion: \n\n> Defensive play callers should look to significantly change the amount they use different numbers of rushers. They should reduce the amount they rush 4 players and should show a greater preference for rushing 5 and 6.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember an important principle: **Equilibrium**. What we have found is the **gradient**, the direction in which change needs to occur. Defensive play callers should undoubtedly look to increase the amount they rush more players, but this should occur in a gradual fashion. For example, the irregularity of rushing 6 players lends it the advantage of surprise; a significant increase in using 6 players will reduce the surprise element and so could impact the effectiveness. \n\nUnderstanding the balance between ***risk*** and ***reward*** will allow defensive play callers to make more informed decisions on how many players to rush. Rushing more passers increases volatility, but on average has the greatest impact on swinging the scoreboard in the Team's favour. Defensive play callers can use this knowledge, with their current appetite for risk (depending on the game situation), to make better decisions to help win Football games!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About the Authors\n\nBen and Arthur met in their first year of university, studying Engineering at the University of Cambridge.
