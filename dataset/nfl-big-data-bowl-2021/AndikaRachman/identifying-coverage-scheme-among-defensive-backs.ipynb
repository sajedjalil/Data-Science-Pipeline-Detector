The main contribution of the paper is to define a set of features from the tracking data that distinguish between \"man\" and \"zone\" coverage of defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques. \n\nThe method can simply be described as follow:\n1. **Feature Generation**: Define a set of features from the tracking data that distinguish between \"man\" and \"zone\" coverage.\n2. **Clustering**: Use mixture models to create clusters corresponding to each group, allowing us to provide probabilistic assignments to each coverage type (or cluster).\n\nOur focus is to analyze the coverage scheme of cornerbacks. Generally, cornerbacks are more adept at providing close coverage on wide receivers and defending passes.The position requires speed and agility, and the ability to track a receiver (in man coverage) or occupy a space and read the quarterback (in zone coverage).\n\nPLEASE UPVOTE if you like this kernel. It will keep me motivated to post more kernel :)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom ipywidgets import interact, fixed\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\nfrom matplotlib import animation\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FFMpegWriter\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n\nimport dateutil\nfrom math import radians\nfrom IPython.display import Video\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.0.

Opportunities for Improvement\nThe paper uses NFL 2019 Big Data Bowl dataset, which does not have player orientation information. The paper identifies two features involving the players’ orientations on the field that may help distinguish man vs. zone coverage:\n1. Orientation of the defensive back relative to the line of scrimmage at different points throughout the play.\n2. Orientation of the cornerback relative to the corresponding offensive player at different points throughout the play.\n\nI will update this kernel to include these two features because our the 2021 dataset has information about players' orientation.\n\n\nThe framework can be used to analyze the coverage types of safeties and, when appropriate, linebackers. However, a complete analysis of these positions would require the design of new features specific to the safety position and the patterns of motion of safeties in relation to their teammates and opponents."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
