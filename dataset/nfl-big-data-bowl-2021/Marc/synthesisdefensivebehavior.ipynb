Data\n\nFor training the model, we used 14 weeks of the regular season game data, 2 weeks for evaluation and one week for testing. \n\nthe input data consists of all the plays conducted with 13 tracked players and the football.\n\nFor each player, we had the features: \n* absolute position,\n* relative position to the ball,\n* velocity in x and y coordinates \n\nfor each timestep, we hand the model the information of:\n\n* features of each player, \n* down, \n* yards left for the offensive team to get the next touchdown\n\nWe do NOT use the orientation of the players, as it is hard to predict the upper body orientation, as it is somewhat uncorrelated to the movement and have not really improved the prediction as it also needed to be estimated.\n\nAll the presented features resulted in a feature vector length of 82. 78 of those entries are features correlated to specific players 2 are the ball absolute position and the last 2 features are the meta data.\n\nThe players are sorted according to their team and position. first we included the features of the defensive team sorted after following positions: \n\n1. 'CB'\n2. 'SS'\n3. 'FS'\n4. 'S'\n5. 'DB'\n6. 'DE'\n\nThe offensive team is sorted as follows: \n\n\n1. 'WR'\n2. 'RB'\n3. 'TE'\n4. 'FB'\n5. 'QB'\n\nAs the most positions are double staffed, we filled up the positions in the appearing order.

Model \n\nThe problem of synthesising the defensive team can be formulated as predicting the next position of a set of previous positions of a single agent and collaborators. Therefore, our dataset consist of a sequence of demonstrations of the players positions and its meta data described in (2. Data). We assume, that every single agents identity does not change over a single demonstration - this means that the role does NOT change dynamically within the same sequence, this reduces our prediciton problem, as we do not need to match the agents with their corresponding models in training.\n\nThis problem is described in [Ross et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686) and is a subarea of reinforcement learning -> Policy Learning. \nThe problem is abstracted to learning the action $a_k$ of agent k corresponding to policy $\\pi_k$ as $\\pi_k(s_k)=a_k$ where $s_k$ describes the state of agent k. This decentralized setting can be decomposed into minimizing $$\\mathcal{L}_{imitation} = \\sum_k \\mathrm{E}_s[l(\\pi_k(s_k))]$$ where $l$ determines the loss function: In our case its the L1-Loss.\n\nTo prevent the model to deveate to much from the training distribution we use DAgger to train the estimator. DAgger is coded as: \n1. Predict next action with estimator from the baseline dataset\n2. Update trainig Data with prediction from 1. and create an updated dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{star}$\n3. Train Estimator with dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{star}$\n\n> The main idea is to use the learned policy's own prediction in the construction of subsequent states, thus simulating the test time performance during training. \n[Le et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03121)\n\nAs estimator we use LSTM Networks as they are especially matching the requirements of learning sequential information. The training data are all the plays from ball snap until the (bitter) end. We use a sequence length of 15 frames and train with sequence overlap of 5 frames.\nOverall we train with 62.000 training samples a 15 frame sequences with 82 features.

Results\n\nDue to a lag of time, we did not train our networks till the validation set did not further improve or build ensamble models -> those will be found in the github repository belonging to this report. The models discussed here hat a mean training error of 1.2m, were not pretrained with the pure immitation dataset and were not fully converged at the time of submitting the report.\n\n\nLet's compare the estimated trajectories from ball snap to Quarterback forward pass with the true trajectories to get a feeling for the accuracy of the predictions:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Functions\ndef compute_speed(data):\n    data['v_x'] = np.sin(data['dir']*np.pi/180) * data['s']\n    data['v_y'] = np.cos(data['dir']*np.pi/180) * data['s']\n    data['v_theta'] = np.arctan(data['v_x']/data['v_y']) if data['v_y'] != 0 else 0 \n    return data\n\ndef roll_out(params):\n\n    prev_feature_vector, legacy_feature_vector, pos_prediction, roleOrder = params\n    #prev_feature_vector = np.concatenate((prev_feature_vector[:roleOrder*13], np.zeros(3),prev_feature_vector[roleOrder*13:]   ))\n    #legacy_feature_vector = np.concatenate((legacy_feature_vector[:roleOrder*13], np.zeros(3),legacy_feature_vector[roleOrder*13:]   ))\n    ### Automate rollout for different amount of players\n    legacy_current = legacy_feature_vector[:,0:78] # 308 = 28*11\n    ball_current = legacy_feature_vector[:,-4:-2] # 317 = 28*11 +9\n    meta_current = legacy_feature_vector[:,-2:]\n    legacy = legacy_current.reshape(legacy_current.shape[0],13,6)#30,13)\n    previous = prev_feature_vector[:,:78].reshape(legacy_current.shape[0],13,6)\n    ball = ball_current[:,0:2]\n    new_matrix = np.array(legacy)\n\n\n    for person in range(pos_prediction.shape[0]):\n        player = legacy[:,person]\n        player[:,:2] = pos_prediction[person,:, :] #position\n        player[:,2:4] = pos_prediction[person,:, :] -

Summary and Future Outlook\n\nWe trained a neural network witch is able to capture general movement of players. Theoretically, it is possible to scatch offensive plays and let the model generate the defensive player movement. The models are not fully converged and we assume that after a few more hours of training we are going to have a more precise model without any wiggeling. With the current model it is not really useful to change meta data as number of down, yards-to-go or player alignment, as the details of the predicted position would vanish in the noise of the model, yet I am confident future models in the [Repository](https://github.com/marcimarc1/NFL2021) are going to be able to capture small differences in defender movement."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# -1.
