Identifying Zone vs Man Coverage</h2>\n\nA fundamental issue to address in this challenge was to identify which coverage types defenses were employing. Traditionally, teams line up in either zone or man coverage. In zone coverage, teams attempt to cover different parts of the field by assigning each player to a zone. Contrastly, in man coverage, each defensive player is responsible for covering one offensive player. \n\nThere are many variations of zone and man coverages, and defenses frequently disguise their coverages to confuse opposing offenses. \n\nSince the data in this challenge was so detailed, we realized that we could use the defensive player data in conjunction with various data science models and statistical analyses to generate predictions about whether the defense was in man or zone coverage. We used unsupervised machine learning in an attempt to classify whether the defense was in man or zone coverage. \n\nTo accomplish this, we generated (with help from some excellent Public Notebooks), new features to determine the variance in distances and relative speeds between defensive and offensive players (`varX`, `varY`, `varS`, `oppVar`, `oppMean`, `mateMean`, `oppDirVar`, `oppDirMean`, `meanOppMateDistRatio`, `varOppMateDistRation`) to better grasp how frequently the defense employed each coverage scheme.\n\nWe then used K-Means, Mini Batch K-Means, and Gaussian Mixture models to classify zone or man coverage, and used our algorithms’ predictions as outputs. As seen below, the models all say the same thing –– that the defenses primarily employ zone coverage schemes."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-01-07T17:04:01.014345Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-01-07T17:04:01.013617Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.460554Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.459913Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.47028,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.460683","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:00.990403","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.50967Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.509024Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.750419Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.749778Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.270201,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.750536","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.480335","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv\")\ncoverage_preds = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nflcoveragepredictions/coverage_preds.csv\")\n\nall_dbs = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nflbdbtopplayers/all_dbs.csv\")\nall_lbs = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nflbdbtopplayers/all_lbs.csv\")\nall_top = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nflbdbtopplayers/all_top.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019921,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.799338","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.779417","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3 style=\"color:gray\">1.1 Using K-Means for Clustering</h3>"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019476,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.839088","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:04.819612","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We used a simple K-Means algorithm to cluster zone vs. man coverage.

This was due to memory constraints and various errors in our debugging process. \n\nNevertheless, we still strongly believe that our overall conclusion is accurate and applicable throughout the entire season.\n\nAnother issue our team faced was that the player names in the play descriptions that were fed into the parsing algorithm were in a different convention than the player names in the players.csv file. \nThis caused some player names to not match up when building on the resultant data to create the linebacker and defensive back data frames.\n\nLastly, when we were exploring various correlations between attributes and defensive performance in linebackers and defensive backs, some of our conditional parameters for attributes (height, weight, age) yielded a data frame with less than 10 observations, which could result in some biased correlations. We felt that despite these smaller sample sizes, because the other attributes were relatively close in value, and the data frame was inherently a subset of a subset, the correlations were worth noting.\n\nUltimately, we believe that our analysis is strong, even with these various technical challenges. \nWe are all in agreement that tackling these issues head-on enabled us to all grow as data scientists and sports analytics enthusiasts. \nWe hope that our findings are of use, and welcome any feedback or suggestions."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.025485,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.320411","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.294926","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"color:blue;font-family:'Tahoma'\">Appendix</h1>"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024759,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.370315","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.345556","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our analysis on man vs zone coverage was inspired by Andika Rachman's [Notebook on Identifying Coverage Scheme Among Defense Backs](https://www.kaggle.com/ar2017/identifying-coverage-scheme-among-defensive-backs)."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.426166Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.424648Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.439056Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.439531Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.043901,"end_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.439687","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-07T17:04:06.395786","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ### FOR DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE BY EVENTS\n# #######################################\n\n# plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv\")\n# players = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv\")\n\n# #
