The objective of the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction contest is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of households using both individual and household characteristics. This \"data science for good\" project offers the opportunity to put our skills towards a task more beneficial to society than getting people to click on ads!\n\nIn this notebook, we will walk through a complete machine learning solution: first, get introduced to the problem, then perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, work on feature engineering, try out multiple machine learning models, select a model, work to optimize the model, and finally, inspect the outputs of the model and draw conclusions. __While this notebook may not get us to the top of the leaderboard, it is meant to be used as a teaching tool to give you a solid foundation to build on for future machine learning projects. Kaggle projects can teach us a lot about machine learning, but several of the strategies used to get to the very top of the leaderboard are not best practices, so here we'll stick to building a very good - although not quite first place - machine learning solution. While Kaggle projects are competitions, I think they are best described as \"a machine learning education\" disguised as a contest!\"\n\nIf you are looking to follow-up on this work, I have additional work including a [kernel on using Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/featuretools-for-good) with [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/#minute-quick-start) for this problem (with slightly higher leaderboard score). (If you enjoy my writing style and explanations, I write for [Towards Data Science](http://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/))\n\n## Problem and Data Explanation\n\nThe data for this competition is provided in two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns while the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents __one individual__ and each column is a __feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of the individual__. The training set has one additional column, `Target`, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale and is the label for the competition. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty. \n\nThis is a __supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem__:\n\n* __Supervised__: provided with the labels for the training data\n* __Multi-class classification__: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to predict poverty on a __household level__. We are given data on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household. In order to create a dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some _aggregations of the individual data_ for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but _\"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring\"_ which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis. \n\n__Important note: while all members of a household should have the same label in the training data, there are errors where individuals in the same household have different labels. In these cases, we are told to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where `parentesco1 == 1.0`.__ We will cover how to correct this in the notebook (for more info take a look at the [competition main discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/discussion/61403)).\n\nThe `Target` values represent poverty levels as follows:\n\n    1 = extreme poverty \n    2 = moderate poverty \n    3 = vulnerable households \n    4 = non vulnerable households\n\nThe explanations for all 143 columns can be found in the [competition documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data), but a few to note are below:\n\n* __Id__: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use! \n* __idhogar__: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\n* __parentesco1__: indicates if this person is the head of the household.\n* __Target__: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\n\nWhen we make a model, we'll train on a household basis with the label for each household _the poverty level of the head of household_. The raw data contains a mix of both household and individual characteristics and for the individual data, we will have to find a way to aggregate this for each household. Some of the individuals belong to a household with _no head of household_ which means that unfortunately we can't use this data for training. These issues with the data are completely typical of __real-world__ data and hence this problem is great preparation for the datasets you'll encounter in a data science job! \n\n### Metric\n\nUltimately we want to build a machine learning model that can predict the integer poverty level of a household. Our predictions will be assessed by the __Macro F1 Score.__ You may be familiar with the [standard F1 score](http://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/) for binary classification problems which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\n$$F_1 = \\frac{2}{\\tfrac{1}{\\mathrm{recall}} + \\tfrac{1}{\\mathrm{precision}}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}}$$\n\nFor mutli-class problems, we have to average the F1 scores for each class. The macro F1 score averages the F1 score for each class _without taking into account label imbalances_. \n\n$$\\text{Macro F1} = \\frac{\\text{F1 Class 1} + \\text{F1 Class 2} + \\text{F1 Class 3} + \\text{F1 Class 4}}{4}$$\n\nIn other words, the number of occurrences of each label does not figure into the calculation when using macro (while it does when using the \"weighted\" score). (For more information on the differences, look at the [Scikit-Learn Documention for F1 Score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) or this [Stack Exchange question and answers](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/15989/42908). If we want to assess our performance, we can use the code:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nf1_score(y_true, y_predicted, average = 'macro`)\n```\n\nFor this problem, the labels are imbalanced, which makes it a little strange to use macro averaging for the evaluation metric, but that's a decision made by the organizers and not something we can change! In your own work, you want to be aware of label imbalances and choose a metric accordingly. \n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe end objective is a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of a household. However, before we get carried away with modeling, it's important to understand the problem and data. Also, we want to evaluate numerous models before choosing one as the \"best\" and after building a model, we want to investigate the predictions. Our roadmap is therefore as follows:\n\n1. Understand the problem (we're almost there already)\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Feature engineering to create a dataset for machine learning\n4. Compare several baseline machine learning models\n5. Try more complex machine learning models\n6. Optimize the selected model\n7. Investigate model predictions in context of problem\n6. Draw conclusions and lay out next steps \n\nThe steps laid out above are iterative meaning that while we will go through them one at a time, we might go back to an earlier step and revisit some of our decisions. In general, data science is a non-linear pracice where we are constantly evaluating our past decisions and making improvements. In particular, feature engineering, modeling, and optimization are steps that we often repeat because we never know if we got them right the first time!\n\n# Getting Started\n\nWe have a pretty good grasp of the problem, so we'll move into the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. For the EDA we'll examine any interesting anomalies, trends, correlations, or patterns that can be used for feature engineering and for modeling. We'll make sure to investigate our data both quantitatively (with statistics) and visually (with figures). \n\nOnce we have a good grasp of the data and any potentially useful relationships, we can do some feature engineering (the most important part of the machine learning pipeline) and establish a baseline model. This won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will provide a strong foundation to build on! \n\nWith all that info in mind (don't worry if you haven't got all the details), let's get started!

This is that part of the analysis: we have to define the columns that are at an individual level and at a household level using the [data decsriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data). There is simply no other way to identify which variables at are the household level than to go through the variables themselves in the data description. Except, I've already done this for you, so all you have to do is copy and paste!\n\nWe'll define different variables because we need to treat some of them in a different manner. Once we have the variables defined on each level, we can work to start aggregating them as needed.\n\nThe process is as follows\n\n1. Break variables into household level and invididual level\n2. Find suitable aggregations for the individual level data\n    * Ordinal variables can use statistical aggregations\n    * Boolean variables can also be aggregated but with fewer stats\n3. Join the individual aggregations to the household level data\n\n### Define Variable Categories\n\nThere are several different categories of variables:\n\n1. Individual Variables: these are characteristics of each individual rather than the household\n    * Boolean: Yes or No (0 or 1)\n    * Ordered Discrete: Integers with an ordering\n2.

Therefore, as the `warning` increases, the poverty level also increases which makes sense because this was meant to show potential bad signs about a house. The `hogar_nin` is the number of children 0 - 19 in the family which also makes sense: younger children can be financial source of stress on a family leading to higher levels of poverty. Or, families with lower socioeconomic status have more children in the hopes that one of them will be able to succeed. Whatever the explanation, there is a [real link between family size and poverty](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/157217/adbi-rp68.pdf)\n\nOn the other hand, for the positive correlations, a higher value means a higher value of Target indicating the poverty severity decreases. The most highly correlated household level variable is `meaneduc`, the average education level of the adults in the household. This relationship between education and poverty intuitively makes sense: [greater levels of education generally correlate with lower levels of poverty](https://www.childfund.org/poverty-and-education/). We don't necessarily know which causes which, but we do know these tend to move in the same direction.\n\nThe general guidelines for correlation values are below, but these will change depending on who you ask ([source](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/pearsons.pdf) for these):\n\n*  .00-.19 “very weak”\n*  .20-.39 “weak”\n*  .40-.59 “moderate”\n*  .60-.79 “strong”\n*  .80-1.0 “very strong”\n\nWhat these correlations show is that there are some weak relationships that hopefully our model will be able to use to learn a mapping from the features to the Target.\n\nNow we can move on to the Spearman correlation.

We already tried one basic model, the Random Forest Classifier which delivered a best macro F1 of 0.35. However, in machine learning, there is no way to know ahead of time which model will work best for a given dataset. The following plot shows that __there are some problems where even Gaussian Naive Bayes will outperform a gradient boosting machine__. This is from [an excellent paper by Randal Olson that discusses many points of machine learning](https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb18/olson.pdf)\n\n![algorithm_comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/algorithm_comparison.png)\n\nWhat this plot tells us is that we have to try out a number of different models to see which is optimal. Most people eventually settle on the __gradient boosting machine__ and we will try that out, but for now we'll take a look at some of the other options.  There are literally dozens (maybe hundreds) of multi-class machine learning models if we look at the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html). We don't have to try them all, but we should sample from the options.\n\nWhat we want to do is write a function that can evaluate a model. This will be pretty simple since we already wrote most of the code. In addition to the Random Forest Classifier, we'll try eight other Scikit-Learn models. Luckily, this dataset is relatively small and we can rapidly iterate through the models.

Machine learning is really just a series of steps, each simple by themselves, with the overall result often extremely powerful. \n\nOur path was as follows:\n\n1. Understand the problem\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n    * Deal with data issues\n    * Fill in missing values\n3. Feature Engineering\n    * Aggregate data \n    * Feature selection in stages\n4. Model Selection\n    * Try many different models to see which one is most promising\n    * Feature selection can also come into play\n5. Model Optimization\n    * Choose the best performing model and tune\n6. Implementing best model\n7. Investigate predictions\n    * Identify model shortcomings\n8. Try new techniques\n    * Experiment and learn! \n  \nAs stated in the introduction, while these steps do have a general order, there is nothing preventing us from repeating them based on subsequent work. For example, we often go back to feature engineering/selection after modeling if we are not satisfied with our performance. After investigating predictions, we might return to the modeling stage and re-think our approach.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that machine learning is largely empirical: there are few established best practices so you need to constantly experiement to determine what works best. That's why we included the last step: we got to try out some new methods and even if they don't pay off for this project, they may be useful in the future. As data scientists we need to be constantly learning to do our work more effectively with the best tools possible.\n\nOur final model does well compared to others in the competition, but overall is not extremely accurate. There might be ways to improve performance, but overall, we might not have enough data to achieve exceptional metrics. That's an important point to remember: at the end of the day, the success or failure of a data science project will rest on the quality and quantity of available data. We have solved the problem of classifying household poverty in Porto Rica as well as we can with the available tools, and the next process if we were in charge would be figuring out what more data could be collected to yield a better solution.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAlthough we tried many possible approaches, there are still some methods that we did not implement but might prove useful:\n\n* Further Hyperparameter tuning: we did not spend much time optimizing the model and there are other packages for optimization that we could try. \n* Further feature selection: we probably do not need to retain all of the features to get the same performance\n* [Oversampling the minority class](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/over_sampling.html) / undersampling the majority class: an advanced techinque that might improve performance\n* Ensembling or stacking multiple models. We could train models on different sections of the data and then combine their predictions to try and better separate the classes. It might also be worthwhile to include models other than the gradient boosting machine. \n\nThe most valuable part of a Kaggle competition is never the rewards, but the knowledge gained along the way. These contests are great for learning how to solve realistic problems and I approach every new problem as an opportunity to improve as a data scientist. Thanks for reading!\n\nIf you're looking for more on this competition, I have a kernel using automated feature engineering for this problem: [Featuretools for Good](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/featuretools-for-good). \n\nBest,\n\nWill \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9d93c507f54c2c9e95d3cb82e5221290c089565","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
