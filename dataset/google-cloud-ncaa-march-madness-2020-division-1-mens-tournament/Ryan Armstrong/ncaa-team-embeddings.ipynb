{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# NCAA Embeddings\n> Learning complex features of NCAA teams with limited data.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Intro\n\nOne of my big projects this past year was preparing to my first Kaggle competition - both the NCAA [Men's](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament) and [Women's](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-womens-tournament) basketball tournaments! Unfortunately, the NCAA tournament was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Regardless, working through my different ideas was a great way to learn some of the basics and nuances of training an ML model effectively.\n\nI tried a few different types of models including a simple 2 layer neural net using [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/) and an ensemble model (XGBoost). These were relatively comprable and both required a similar level of feature engineering to get a good result (I think due to the limited data set - ~64 games per year since 2003 with the detailed game data). The results were fine, but I was wondering if there was a solution that could allow for less feature engineering and still give a reasonable result.\n\nEnter embeddings... in this notebook I'm going to explore a simple Keras implementation of embeddings to represent each NCAA team (e.g. Duke 2019 $\\neq$ Duke 2020). For now, I will use those embeddings to perform some exploratory analysis to verify that they have learned useful features and in a following notebook I will use these embeddings as input features to an NCAA tournament model. This work was inspired by [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/abhijitbrahme/embedding-ncaa-model). Though the predictions aren't spectacular, I think the exploratory analysis shows that embeddings could be a useful feature if paired with more detailed data and a model refined to predict NCAA tournament games as opposed to regular season games.\n\n**What you will see in this notebook at a high level:**\n - Brief data prep - we are only using wins/losses, points, home/away, and team IDs as inputs to the model. *This work will later be expanded to incorporate more advanced statistics.\n - Model build - This model is being built with the sole purpose of generating useful embeddings. To achieve that we are training the model to be predictive of features that we would ordinarily use as feature inputs to a real tournament model (in this case, regular season wins and losses).\n - Training and validation - the model is trained using only regular season data from all years and is validated on a secondary set of tournament data ([NIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Invitation_Tournament)). This is difficult because we have a slight mismatch between our training and validation data. The validation data is generally similar and likely more representative of the real NCAA tournament.\n - Sense check and exploratory analysis - First thing is to check that predictions from the model are sensisble, but what we really care about is the embeddings. Do they carry more useful information than simple aggregations of the data they represent? In short, Yes!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Packages and Data\n\nI'll be implementing this in Keras. My previous attempt using [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/) was quick and easy. Using embeddings for categorical data made the FastAI model a bit more elegant than XGBoost. However, we need two input variables (team 1 and team 2) to call the same embeddings matrix in this solution. FastAI can't do that out of the box and so I get to venture into the world of building my own in Keras. I plan on going one step deeper and building my final tournament model with TensorFlow."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define and register a kaggle renderer for Altair\n# Source for this: https://www.kaggle.com/jakevdp/altair-kaggle-renderer\n\nimport altair as alt\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\nKAGGLE_HTML_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\n<style>\n.vega-actions a {{\n    margin-right: 12px;\n    color: #757575;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-size: 13px;\n}}\n.error {{\n    color: red;\n}}\n</style>\n<div id=\"{output_div}\"></div>\n<script>\nrequirejs.config({{\n    \"paths\": {{\n        \"vega\": \"{base_url}/vega@{vega_version}?noext\",\n        \"vega-lib\": \"{base_url}/vega-lib?noext\",\n        \"vega-lite\": \"{base_url}/vega-lite@{vegalite_version}?noext\",\n        \"vega-embed\": \"{base_url}/vega-embed@{vegaembed_version}?noext\",\n    }}\n}});\nfunction showError(el, error){{\n    el.innerHTML = ('<div class=\"error\">'\n                    + '<p>JavaScript Error: ' + error.message + '</p>'\n                    + \"<p>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification. \"\n                    + \"See the javascript console for the full traceback.</p>\"\n                    + '</div>');\n    throw error;\n}}\nrequire([\"vega-embed\"], function(vegaEmbed) {{\n    const spec = {spec};\n    const embed_opt = {embed_opt};\n    const el = document.getElementById('{output_div}');\n    vegaEmbed(\"#{output_div}\", spec, embed_opt)\n      .catch(error => showError(el, error));\n}});\n</script>\n\"\"\"\n\nclass KaggleHtml(object):\n    def __init__(self, base_url='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm'):\n        self.chart_count = 0\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        \n    @property\n    def output_div(self):\n        return \"vega-chart-{}\".format(self.chart_count)\n        \n    def __call__(self, spec, embed_options=None, json_kwds=None):\n        # we need to increment the div, because all charts live in the same document\n        self.chart_count += 1\n        embed_options = embed_options or {}\n        json_kwds = json_kwds or {}\n        html = KAGGLE_HTML_TEMPLATE.format(\n            spec=json.dumps(spec, **json_kwds),\n            embed_opt=json.dumps(embed_options),\n            output_div=self.output_div,\n            base_url=self.base_url,\n            vega_version=alt.VEGA_VERSION,\n            vegalite_version=alt.VEGALITE_VERSION,\n            vegaembed_version=alt.VEGAEMBED_VERSION\n        )\n        return {\"text/html\": html}\n    \nalt.renderers.register('kaggle', KaggleHtml())\nprint(\"Define and register the kaggle renderer.
