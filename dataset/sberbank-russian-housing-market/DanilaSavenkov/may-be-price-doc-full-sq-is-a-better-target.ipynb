{"nbformat":4,"cells":[{"source":"For me the idea is quite obvious:\nthe majority of given features are able to characterise not the price of the apartment, but how expensive the apartments like this are in general. For example if I have kremlin_km==3 I can easily infer that it's the city centre, apartments are expensive here and I can get the certain range for price_doc/full_sq for such apartments. This range will be much less wide than the range of price_doc because price_doc/full_sq in the selected area would be more or less equal for flats with full_sq=40 and full_sq=80. While the price_doc could differ in 2 times.","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"5eb84c21961ca292c08e934051dbac54606537f2"},"outputs":[]},{"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv',index_col='id',parse_dates=['timestamp'])\n\n#we have to drop entries with unlikely low full_sq\nprint(len(data[data['full_sq']<15]), ' entries drop')\ndata = data.drop((data[data['full_sq']<15]).index)\n\ndata['price_per_meter'] = data['price_doc']/data['full_sq']","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"df5c8d4a809c51d34fc44322c0c789e4ca9a1b93"},"execution_count":23},{"source":"data.loc[:,data.columns.drop('price_per_meter')].corr()['price_doc'].sort_values()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"a306f5e125ce79e8eba6eec3e4aded5fbc107f14"},"outputs":[]},{"source":"data.loc[:,data.columns.drop('price_doc')].corr()['price_per_meter'].sort_values()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"62baa2aeaaaf03f45ef82a561cd6c55e75ef4be4"},"outputs":[]},{"source":"As you see, price_per_meter is much more correlated with the features.\nBut at the moment I couldn't get any yield of it.
