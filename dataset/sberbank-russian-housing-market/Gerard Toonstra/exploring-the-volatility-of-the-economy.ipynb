In this dataset, the economy is highly volatile, as the following will show.

When inflation goes up, people see their income disappear straight into a black hole of purchases and consumption. Investing into fixed assets is a strategy to maintain more control over your income in an attempt to bridge periods of high volatility in the economy. So high inflation does not necessarily mean that people avoid purchasing houses, it can cause people to purchase more. The interest rate makes borrowing money very expensive, which reduces people's willingness to purchase more houses. Then there is also the delay over which people make decisions, you don't buy a house in one or two month's time, first you need to select a property whilst following the news how inflation and interest rates are making an impact. Then you need to worry if the contract you're about to close and the associated rates allow you to sustain a living or if the economy goes back to normal and you're stuck with an excessively high interest rate payoff that you closed off in a really bad time period. All these factors in a volatile period make it extremely difficult to predict the house price, especially given the fact that near the end of the training set we see this huge spike in the way, which has a huge impact on actions that people take and which could go either way.\n\nWhen more people decide to purchase property, the price goes up beyond the inflation rate, because moscow has land scarcity and people are looking at the best investment they can make. The inflation rate and interest spike could cause people to wait on the purchases, leading to an increasing trend of house prices due to inflation, but maybe not entirely following the inflation trend due to demand falling off."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"db614bc7-2bb0-8f54-9d74-d05f9c0e4d7a"},"source":"What people have already noticed is that RMSE so far is a better error metric than RMSLE, which suggests that RMSLE is under-valuing the house prices for the test set and further suggests that the algorithm doesn't embed the trend very well. We are looking at an anomalous situation however and it's unclear how the house prices truly react to that. Also, it should be the goal to find great explanators or models that truly predict things well rather than training on RMSE itself, because that doesn't provide a generic model. This model would then (potentially) show a good performance when the house price goes up, but be awful when the house prices are going down or stabilizing over another period."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5d1db943-ea0e-4014-d07c-caac66a24e0b"},"source":"**Vote up if these insights are useful to you!**"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"57a9e519-2d4d-e893-752e-aacc6125b97d"},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
