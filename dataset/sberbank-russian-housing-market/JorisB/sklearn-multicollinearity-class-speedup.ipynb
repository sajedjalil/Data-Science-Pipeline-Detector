As noted by original author the script is very slow. This one provided a significant speedup (when applied to many columns with infinite VIF values as is the case here) by not adding much code.\n\nThis notebook is based on the prior work done by Roberto Ruiz in https://www.kaggle.com/robertoruiz/sberbank-russian-housing-market/dealing-with-multicollinearity. As such, I won't go into explanation of the theory because they have already done a fantastic job of doing so. If you have any questions on the theory then please feel free to ask, but I'd definitely suggest that everyone read Roberto's work as an introduction."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c7759a04-234e-8b52-700d-b4af8b36f7ef"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\n# Extra imports necessary for the code\n\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer\n\nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8f071591-16d3-c4f3-3ab4-7022aa162b0f"},"source":"Based on the work set out by Roberto, I've created a scikit-learn transformer class that can be used to remove columns that have a high VIF factor (in short, they have high colinearity with other columns within the dataset and as such should probably be removed).\n\nThis class is based on a standard scikit-learn transformer and also uses the statsmodel library for calculating the VIF number.
