The reason I wanted to try it out is that it's a model that is reasonably simple to understand and get an intuitive feel for. I can more or less code the algorithm myself and this brings the benefit that it's a lot easier to understand what is going on and make the right choices when trying to improve the model by cleaning the data, trying out different parameters, et c.\n\nJust applying Random Forest or Gradient Boosting without knowing how they work or what each parameter of the model does feels kind of scary. It might be reasonably easy to get a good \"score\" but how can I tell if I reached the right conclusions, how well the model would transfer to a sligthly different scenario or how changes in the raw data would affect the model? I would love to learn more about these models as well but as I've recently gotten started with this I am taking one step at a time.\n\nI've tried to include all relevant steps of my analysis but have omitted some that would result in a long output.

On the one hand this might indicate why linear regression won't really work for this type of problem/data. The price of an apartement is heavily influenced by its geographical location. On the other hand, the \"area attributes\" can only take the values 0 or 1 and (although I have normalized all input variables) it might take a pretty strong coefficient to bump up the importance of these values enough to get the correct effect on the target variable (sale price).\n\nMaybe a linear regression model would work better if we had a \"distance from city center\" attribute that would take on linear and not binary values.\n\nThe way a human would estimate the price would certainly be to look at similar apartements in the area so any estimator that could simulate that would probably do better. Maybe that is what you could get a random forest regressor to do (i.e. split on the area attribute high up in the decision trees) but I'll leave that for a future experiment.\n\n## Conclusion\nI want to emphasize that I'm quite new at this and I probably made several mistakes along the way. I would be very happy if someone could point these out - that's the best way to learn. Further, I did not put too much rigour and thought into the different steps and perhaps there are ways to make this work better that I just did not see because I didn't spend enough time thinking about it but that's the benefit of not doing this professionally - I can just do enough to learn and then call it a day and move on once I think I have learned enough. To do a real analysis of all this data would for sure take months if not years.\n\n### What to do next\nI actually tried out a few other linear models (Lasso and ElasticNet) that do not penalize the square of errors but the absolute errors and they resulted in slightly, but not _that_ much, better results. It might also have been an idea to try out other things with the macro data, e.g. using a longer period of macro data instead of just the current month. However, I have a strong feeling that linear regression is not the way to approach this problem so if I continue working on it I will try out some other models.\n\nThank you, if you read all the way here and now at least you know what not to try out for the competition and hopefully you agree with my theory about why!"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
