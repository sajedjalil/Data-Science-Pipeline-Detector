This is effectively the same as the standard Lasso algorithm, but it will use cross validation to figure out the best parameters each time you use the model.

To me this makes sense since the model used is OLS, and the Lasso belongs to this family of regressors.\n\nThe Bonferroni corrected test is included in Statsmodels, so we'll use it here.

Passive Aggressive Regression\n    8. Huber\n3. A whole list of data engineering steps:\n    1. Making Year and Month categorical\n    2. Playing around with GarageYrBuilt\n    3. Adding in external data (interest rates)\n    4. etc etc\n    \nIf anyone has tips on stacking that would be greatly appreciated! I'd love it for someone to take the data from here and use it to beat my score with a stacked model :)","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"ce88a86dde4dc8f9bd859ecd3c1886b62e6fa30b","_cell_guid":"cdc896bc-5c87-4ef7-927a-86cf08cb6b31"},"execution_count":null,"source":"# Appendix","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"a047bbf90bb135ffa8aabc1ff0eab17427479fd1","_cell_guid":"69325c7e-ae5d-464d-8613-ce73ef95e092"},"execution_count":null,"source":"## Sumbit Code","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"3ec357f740a9300d7c241fffc9bc3db41cc02962","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"651c06f8-1343-4c02-8e3a-ad7ee77fef24"},"execution_count":null,"source":"xgb_ens.fit(X_train, y_train);\nscale_LCV.fit(X_train,y_train);","cell_type":"code"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"3e21f26121c9442dc2f0bfd39505fd4194d35939","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"556216c9-7aa3-4dad-a79c-7470962ba773"},"execution_count":null,"source":"preds_x = np.expm1(xgb_ens.predict(X_test));\npreds_l = np.expm1(scale_LCV.predict(X_test));\npreds = (preds_x+preds_l)/2\nout_preds = pd.DataFrame()\nout_preds['Id'] = test['Id']\nout_preds['SalePrice'] = preds\nout_preds.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)","cell_type":"code"}],"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4}
