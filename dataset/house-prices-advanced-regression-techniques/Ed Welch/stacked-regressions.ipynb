I've read  some great notebooks here. To name a few:\n\n1. [Comprehensive data exploration with Python][1] by **Pedro Marcelino**  : Great and very motivational data analysis\n\n2. [A study on Regression applied to the Ames dataset][2] by **Julien Cohen-Solal**  : Thorough features engeneering and deep dive into linear regression analysis  but really easy to follow for beginners.\n\n3. [Regularized Linear Models][3] by **Alexandru Papiu**  : Great Starter kernel on modelling and Cross-validation\n\nI can't recommend enough every beginner to go carefully through these kernels (and of course through many others great kernels) and get their first insights in data science and kaggle competitions.\n\nAfter that (and some basic pratices) you should be more confident to go through [this great script][7] by **Human Analog**  who did an impressive work on features engeneering. \n\nAs the dataset is particularly handy, I  decided few days ago to get back in this competition and apply things I learnt so far, especially stacking models. For that purpose, we build two stacking classes  ( the simplest approach and a less simple one). \n\nAs these classes are written for general purpose, you can easily adapt them and/or extend them for your regression problems. \nThe overall approach is  hopefully concise and easy to follow.. \n\nThe features engeneering is rather parsimonious (at least compared to some others great scripts) . It is pretty much :\n\n- **Imputing missing values**  by proceeding sequentially through the data\n\n- **Transforming** some numerical variables that seem really categorical\n\n- **Label Encoding** some categorical variables that may contain information in their ordering set\n\n-  [**Box Cox Transformation**][4] of skewed features (instead of log-transformation) : This gave me a **slightly better result** both on leaderboard and cross-validation.\n\n- ** Getting dummy variables** for categorical features. \n\nThen we choose many base models (mostly sklearn based models + sklearn API of  DMLC's [XGBoost][5] and Microsoft's [LightGBM][6]), cross-validate them on the data before stacking/ensembling them. The key here is to make the (linear) models robust to outliers. This improved the result both on LB and cross-validation. \n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python\n

Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here **train** and .**holdout** )\n\n2. Train several base models on the first part (**train**)\n\n3. Test these base models on the second part (**holdout**)\n\n4. Use the predictions from 3)  (called  out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs  to train a higher level learner called **meta-model**.\n\nThe first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration,  we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold). \n\nSo, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as \nnew feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.\n\nFor the prediction part , We average the predictions of  all base models on the test data  and used them as **meta-features**  on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"69f216ce13eb61f0d07403986a2d38b11e18ae6a","_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"cb18e314-968d-4765-942a-5706d0f4f815"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Faron](http://i.imgur.com/QBuDOjs.jpg)\n\n(Image taken from [Faron](https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/18153#post103381))","metadata":{"_uuid":"5e232cc0edea67af1fc672ee07a93c435e7e2f98","_cell_guid":"7a1d4b95-ad19-4522-8459-99f0839a49bb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![kaz](http://5047-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image5.gif)\n\nGif taken from [KazAnova's interview](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/06/15/stacking-made-easy-an-introduction-to-stacknet-by-competitions-grandmaster-marios-michailidis-kazanova/)","metadata":{"_uuid":"7c4d68ee6e6dffdf0b816bee48fd55b29bd66386","_cell_guid":"9e3f01cb-cd76-4861-81c0-775c613f7d7f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On this gif, the base models are algorithms 0, 1, 2 and the meta-model is algorithm 3.
