Hypothesis Generation <a id=\"2\"></a>\nHypothesis generation, in general, is to create a set of features that should impact the target variable given a confidence interval (taken as 95% all the time). We should do this before looking at the data to avoid biased thoughts. This step often helps in creating new features. Defining a hypothesis has two parts: Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternate Hypothesis(H1).\n* The H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is no relationship between our independent and dependent variables.\n* The H1 (Alternate Hypothesis): There is indeed a relationship between our independent and dependent variables.\n\nNow how do we can accept or reject any hypothesis? Usually, we look for probablity values(p value) between our predictor and target variables. That is if the p-value is significant (less than 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternate hypothesis. On the other hand, if p value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and therefore conclude that there is statistically no relationship between our target and predictor variables. The features that I think should have an impact on the price of the house are:\n1. Area the house has been built on.\n2. Number of floors it has.\n3. Number of bedrooms it has.\n4.

By now, we should have a idea about the distribution of the variables and the presence of outliers in those variables. For categorical variables mode-imputation is performed and for numerical variable mean-impuation is performed if its distribution is symmetric(or almost symmetric or normal like Age). On the other hand, for a variable with skewed distribution and outliers, meadian-imputation is recommended as median is more immune to outliers than mean.\n\nHowever, one clear disadvantage of using mean, median or mode to impute missing values is the addition of bias if the amount of missing values is significant. So simply replacing missing values with the mean or the median might not be the best solution since missing values may differ by groups and categories. To solve this, we can group our data by some variables that have no missing values and for each subset compute the median to impute the missing values of a variable. \n\n**For this purpose we would merge train and test data together. This will eliminate the hassle of handling train and test data separately thought it might induce some data leakage problem.

Moreover, all the preprocessings done combinedly lead to better a leaderboard score (may be due to data leakage).**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"890393ca4238f23e5304dc8e43296ed58ba7dd01"},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Separate our target variable first.'''\ny_train = df_train.SalePrice\n\n'''Drop SalePrice from train data.'''\ndf_train.drop('SalePrice', axis = 1, inplace = True)\n\n'''Now combine train and test data frame together.'''\ndf_merged = pd.concat([df_train, df_test], axis = 0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"05f4f3d752b3f7d4d0aae57f0842ff6d3b2c79f7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Columns with missing observations.'''\nmissing_columns = df_merged.columns[df_merged.isnull().any()].values\n'''Number of columns with missing observations.'''\ntotal_columns = np.count_nonzero(df_merged.isna().sum())\nprint('We have ' , total_columns ,  'features with missing values and those features (with missing values) are: \\n\\n' , missing_columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"222e4e0868da915019064c385edccbd96b630bbe"},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Get and plot only the features (with missing values) and their corresponding missing values.'''\nmissing_columns = len(df_merged) - df_merged.loc[:, np.sum(df_merged.isnull())>0].count()\nx = missing_columns.index\ny = missing_columns\ntitle = 'Variables with Missing Values'\nscatter_plot(x, y, title, 'Features Having Missing Observations','Missing Values', 30, 'Picnic')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"23ccaf99b9084bd4d5fe9f9f6a3666582d079875"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Usually we drop a variable if at least 40% of its values are missing.

But train accuracy of a model is not enough to tell if a model can be able to generalize the unseen data or not. Because training data is something our model has been trained with, i.e., data our model has already seen it. We all know that, the purpose of building a machine learning model is to generalize the unseen data, i.e., data our model has not yet seen.

For this problem, we don't know the ground truth for the test set but we do know for the train set. So the idea is to train and evaluate the model performance on different data. One thing we can do is to split the train set in two groups, usually in 80:20 ratio. That means we would train our model on 80% of the training data and we reserve the rest 20% for evaluating the model since we know the ground truth for this 20% data. Then we can compare our model prediction with this ground truth (for 20% data). That's how we can tell how our model would perform on unseen data. This is the first model evaluation technique. In sklearn we have a train_test_split method for that. Let's evaluate our model using train_test_split method. **Note: From now on, we will be using root mean squared error as the evaluation metric for this problem. So smaller is better.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"abe53fd9df9e4db4138feab9e0f29559cbaf2934"},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Evaluate models on the holdout set(say on 30%).'''\ndef train_test_split_score(model):\n    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(df_train_final, y_train, test_size = 0.3, random_state = seed)\n    model.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n    prediction = model.predict(X_test)\n    mse = mean_squared_error(prediction, Y_test)\n    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)\n    return rmse\n\n'''Calculate train_test_split score of differnt models and plot them.'''\nmodels = [lasso, ridge, kr, elnt, dt, svm, knn, rf, et, ab, gb, xgb, lgb]\ntrain_test_split_rmse = []\nfor model in models:\n    train_test_split_rmse.append(train_test_split_score(model))\n\n'''Plot data frame of train test rmse'''\ntrain_test_score = pd.DataFrame(data = train_test_split_rmse, columns = ['Train_Test_RMSE'])\ntrain_test_score.index = ['LSO', 'RIDGE', 'KR', 'ELNT', 'DT', 'SVM', 'KNN', 'RF', 'ET', 'AB', 'GB', 'XGB', 'LGB']\ntrain_test_score = train_test_score.round(5)\nx = train_test_score.index\ny = train_test_score['Train_Test_RMSE']\ntitle = \"Models' Test Score (RMSE) on Holdout(30%) Set\"\nscatter_plot(x, y, title, 'Models','RMSE', 30, 'RdBu')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5a63a05bf602ac76dd44a4a0e11584009c4c89ce"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Being root mean squared error, smaller is better. Looks like, SVM is the best regression model followed by Ridge, GB and XGB. Unfortunately, LR can't find any linear pattern, hence it performs worst and hence discarded.** \n\nHowever, train_test split has its drawbacks. Because this approach introduces bias as we are not using all of our observations for testing and also we're reducing the train data size. To overcome this we can use a technique called cross validation where all the data is used for training and testing periodically. Thus we may reduce the bias introduced by train_test_split. From different cross validation methods, we would use k-fold cross validation. In sklearn we have a method cross_val_score for calculating k-fold cross validation score.\n\nHowever, as the train set gets larger, train_test_split has its advantage over k-fold cross validation. Train_test_split is k-times faster than k-fold cross validation. If the training set is very large, both train_test_split and k-fold cross validation perform identically. So for a large training data, train_test_split is prefered over k-fold cross validation to accelerate the training process.\n\n### 11.2.1 K-Fold Cross Validation <a id=\"11.2.1\"></a>\nLet's say we will use 10-fold cross validation. So k = 10 and we have total 1456 observations. Each fold would have 1456/10 = 145.6 observations. So basically k-fold cross validation uses fold-1 (145.6 samples) as the testing set and k-1 (9 folds) as the training sets and calculates test accuracy.This procedure is repeated k times (if k = 10, then 10 times); each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation or test set. This process results in k estimates of the test accuracy which are then averaged out."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a6031106257b50623102ea376d86c95e11ae602a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Function to compute cross validation scores.'''\ndef cross_validate(model):\n    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n    neg_x_val_score = cross_val_score(model, df_train_final, y_train, cv = 10, n_jobs = -1, scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error')\n    x_val_score = np.round(np.sqrt(-1*neg_x_val_score), 5)\n    return x_val_score.mean()\n\n'''Calculate cross validation score of differnt models and plot them.'''\nmodels = [lasso, ridge, kr, elnt, dt, svm, knn, rf, et, ab, gb, xgb, lgb]\ncross_val_scores = []\nfor model in models:\n    cross_val_scores.append(cross_validate(model))\n\n'''Plot data frame of cross validation scores.'''\nx_val_score = pd.DataFrame(data = cross_val_scores, columns = ['Cross Validation Scores (RMSE)'])\nx_val_score.index = ['LSO', 'RIDGE', 'KR', 'ELNT', 'DT', 'SVM', 'KNN', 'RF', 'ET', 'AB', 'GB', 'XGB', 'LGB']\nx_val_score = x_val_score.round(5)\nx = x_val_score.index\ny = x_val_score['Cross Validation Scores (RMSE)']\ntitle = \"Models' 10-fold Cross Validation Scores (RMSE)\"\nscatter_plot(x, y, title, 'Models','RMSE', 30, 'Viridis')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"80e52bda2b7b6551aa772a1785d455bb3d5ad68c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Looks like Ridge has managed to beat SVM as the best regression model on 10-fold cross validation.

In the following section we would introduce ensemble technique and try to improve our position on leaderboard.**\n\n# 12.Introduction to Ensemble <a id=\"12\"></a>\n**Ensembles combine predictions from different models to generate a final prediction, and the more models we include the better it performs. Better still, because ensembles combine baseline predictions, they perform at least as well as the best baseline model. Most of the errors from a model’s learning are from three main factors: variance, noise, and bias. By using ensemble methods, we’re able to increase the stability of the final model and reduce the errors caused by bias, variance, and noise. By combining many models, we’re able to (mostly) reduce the variance, even when they are individually not great, as we won’t suffer from random errors from a single source. The main principle behind ensemble modelling is to group weak learners together to form one strong learner.**\n\n**To implement an ensemble we need three basic things:**\n* A group of base learners that generate predictions.\n* A meta learner that learns how to best combine these predictions outputed by base learners.\n* And finally a method for splitting the training data between the base learners and the meta learner.\n\n**An ensemble works best if:**\n* There is a less correlation in the base models' predictions.\n* We increase the number of base learners though it might slow the process down.\n\n**Ensemble methods can be divided into two, i.e., **\n1. Simple Ensemble Method 2. Advanced Ensemble Method\n\n## 12.1 Simple Ensemble Methods <a id=\"12.1\"></a>\nThey're the simpliest yet so useful form of ensembles. They can be further categorised into\n* Voting,\n* Averaging, and\n* Weighted Average.\n\n**Being a regression problem, we would perform averaging only. Before performing averaging ensemble, we need to investigate the correlations among the base models' predictions so that we can choose the most diverse model that would perform better than correlated models.
