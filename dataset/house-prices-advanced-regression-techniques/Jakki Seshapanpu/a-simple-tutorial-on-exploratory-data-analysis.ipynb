It is an approach for summarizing, visualizing, and becoming intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.\n\n### Value of Exploratory Data Analysis\nExploratory Data Analysis is valuable to data science projects since it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts. Such level of certainty can be achieved only after raw data is validated and checked for anomalies, ensuring that the data set was collected without errors. EDA also helps to find insights that were not evident or worth investigating to business stakeholders and data scientists but can be very informative about a particular business.\n\nEDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning. Once data scientists become familiar with the data set, they often have to return to feature engineering step, since the initial features may turn out not to be serving their intended purpose. Once the EDA stage is complete, data scientists get a firm feature set they need for supervised and unsupervised machine learning.\n\n### Methods of Exploratory Data Analysis\nIt is always better to explore each data set using multiple exploratory techniques and compare the results. Once the data set is fully understood, it is quite possible that data scientist will have to go back to data collection and cleansing phases in order to transform the data set according to the desired business outcomes. The goal of this step is to become confident that the data set is ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis is majorly performed using the following methods:\n\n- Univariate visualization — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set\n- Bivariate visualization — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest\n- Multivariate visualization — is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset\n- Dimensionality reduction — helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data.\nThrough these methods, the data scientist validates assumptions and identifies patterns that will allow for the understanding of the problem and model selection and validates that the data has been generated in the way it was expected to. So, value distribution of each field is checked, a number of missing values is defined, and the possible ways of replacing them are found.\n\nAdditional benefits Exploratory Data Analysis brings to projects\nAnother side benefit of EDA is that it allows to specify or even define the questions you are trying to get the answer to from your data. Companies, that are only starting to leverage Data Science and AI technologies, often face the situation when they realize, that they have a lot of data and no ideas of what value that data can bring to their business decision making.\n\nHowever, the questions always come first in data analysis. It doesn’t matter how much data company has, how many tools they have available, whether the data is historical or real time unless business stakeholders have the questions they are trying to solve with their data. EDA can help such companies to start formalizing the right questions, since with wrong questions you get the wrong answers, and take the wrong decisions.\n\n#### Why skipping Exploratory Data Analysis is a bad idea?\n\nIn a hurry to get to the machine learning stage or simply impress business stakeholders very fast, data scientists tend to either entirely skip the exploratory process or do a very shallow work. It is a very serious and, sadly, common mistake of amateur data science consulting “professionals”.\n\nSuch inconsiderate behavior can lead to skewed data, with outliers and too many missing values and, therefore, some sad outcomes for the project:\n\n- generating inaccurate models;\n- generating accurate models on the wrong data;\n- choosing the wrong variables for the model;\n- inefficient use of the resources, including the rebuilding of the model.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used on the one hand to answer questions, test business assumptions, generate hypotheses for further analysis. On the other hand, you can also use it to prepare the data for modeling. \n\nThe thing that these two probably have in common is a good knowledge of your data to either get the answers that you need or to develop an intuition for interpreting the results of future modeling.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to reach these goals as follows:\n\n1. Import the data\n\n2. Get a feel of the data ,describe the data,look at a sample of data like first and last rows\n\n3. Take a deeper look into the data by querying or indexing the data\n\n4. Identify features of interest\n\n5. Recognise the challenges posed by data - missing values, outliers\n\n6. Discover patterns in the data\n\nOne of the important things about EDA is  Data profiling. \n\n**Data profiling** is concerned with summarizing your dataset through descriptive statistics. You want to use a variety of measurements to better understand your dataset. The goal of data profiling is to have a solid understanding of your data so you can afterwards start querying and visualizing your data in various ways. However, this doesn’t mean that you don’t have to iterate: exactly because data profiling is concerned with summarizing your dataset, it is frequently used to assess the data quality. Depending on the result of the data profiling, you might decide to correct, discard or handle your data differently.\n\n\n### Key Concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n- <b>2 types of Data Analysis</b>\n   - Confirmatory Data Analysis\n   \n   - Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n- <b>4 Objectives of EDA</b>\n   - Discover Patterns\n   \n   - Spot Anomalies\n   \n   - Frame Hypothesis\n   \n   - Check Assumptions\n\n- <b>2 methods for exploration</b>\n   - Univariate Analysis\n   \n   - Bivariate Analysis\n\n- <b>Stuff done during EDA</b>\n   - Trends\n   \n   - Distribution\n   \n   - Mean\n   \n   - Median\n   \n   - Outlier\n   \n   - Spread measurement (SD)\n   \n   - Correlations\n   \n   - Hypothesis testing\n   \n   - Visual Exploration\n   \n## Overview\n\nThis is an exploratory data analysis on the House Prices Kaggle Competition found at \n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\n\n### Description\n\nAsk a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n\nWith 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\n\nThere are 1460 instances of  training data and 1460 of test data.
