Understanding the Client and their Problem\n\nA benefit to this study is that we can have two clients at the same time! (Think of being a divorce lawyer for both interested parties) However, in this case, we can have both clients with no conflict of interest!\n\nClient Housebuyer: This client wants to find their next dream home with a reasonable price tag. They have their locations of interest ready. Now, they want to know if the house price matches the house value. With this study, they can understand which features (ex. Number of bathrooms, location, etc.) influence the final price of the house. If all matches, they can ensure that they are getting a fair price.\n\nClient Houseseller: Think of the average house-flipper. This client wants to take advantage of the features that influence a house price the most. They typically want to buy a house at a low price and invest on the features that will give the highest return. For example, buying a house at a good location but small square footage. The client will invest on making rooms at a small cost to get a large return.

Multivariable Analysis\n\nLet's check out all the variables! There are two types of features in housing data, categorical and numerical. \n\nCategorical data is just like it sounds. It is in categories. It isn't necessarily linear, but it follows some kind of pattern. For example, take a feature of \"Downtown\". The response is either \"Near\", \"Far\", \"Yes\", and \"No\".  Back then, living in downtown usually meant that you couldn't afford to live in uptown. Thus, it could be implied that downtown establishments cost less to live in. However, today, that is not the case. (Thank you, hipsters!) So we can't really establish any particular order of response to be \"better\" or \"worse\" than the other.\n\nNumerical data is data in number form. (Who could have thought!)
