I'm doing this for learning purposes and share back to community what I learned. So there might be areas can be improved in future.\n\n#### My main objectives on this project are:\n+ Applying exploratory data analysis and trying to get some insights about our dataset\n+ Getting data in better shape by transforming and feature engineering to help us in building better models\n+ Building and tuning couple models to get some stable results on predicting housing prices\n\n#### In this notebook we are going to try explore the data we have and going try answer questions like:\n+ What are the main predictors for house pricing?\n+ What is more important on pricing, having big area for housing or just being in better neighborhood?\n+ Is quality of the house alone more important than having nice garages or basements?\n+ There are some features that can be modified and depends on the building but there are some other features like cannot be changed like location of the house, which group is effecting house prices?\n+ Can we predict the price of a house with the given traning data using machine learning techniques.\n+ What can our predictions achieve with different approaches?\n+ If we stack and blend the models, can we get more regularized results?\n\n\n**I hope you enjoy while reading it!
