{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"54585743-10b2-ce6f-c396-9134ba654f03"},"source":"Typically, when you want to use the standard pandas/sklearn framework to tackle a machine learning or data analysis problem, you will start analysing the dataset using pandas. Once you've gotten some insights, you may derive a transformed data set using pandas and derive a model using a scikit-learn estimator like Linear or Ridge Regression. Typically, you will estimate the performance of such a model using cross validation.\n\nThere are several things I don't like with this approach and want to raise awareness of:\n1. Typically, notebooks contain a lot of repetitive code\n2. The pandas and scikit-learn frameworks are somehow separated and a combined pipeline is not used\n3. Most importantly: As it is explained [here]http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#computing-cross-validated-metrics) the preprocessing step should be tested on a hold out set. This implies, that cross-validation on a dataset requires to perform preprocessing on the respective subsets constructed during cross-validation.\n    \nTo solve these issues, we only have to find the answer to the following question: Is there a way to perform scikit-learn and pipeline compatible preprocessing using pandas?\n\nLuckily, all we need to do is to adhere to the scikit-learn transformers api. A transformer typically contains a transform and a fit method. Using the scikits [TransformerMixin-Class](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.TransformerMixin.html#sklearn.base.TransformerMixin) a fit_transform function is constructed.\n\nLet us briefly describe how transformers are used:\n\nIf the transformer needs to remember the state of the training data, e.g. the mean of a column, the fit method is used on the training data to store this state. Subsequently, the transform function is used on the train and test data. However, if not state preservation is needed, e.g. in the case of log transforming data, the fit functions may essentially do nothing, and we just use the transform function. Note that the fit function is **never** used on the test data\n\nSo the agenda of this notebooks is as follows:\n\n1. Load and read the data\n2. Define transformer objects (feel free to skip this lengthy paragraph at first)\n3. Use these transformers to preprocess the data\n4. Use preprocessing and Ridge regression, gridsearch and crossvalidation to estimate the generalization performance\n6. Under the assumption, that the gridsearch parameters are stable between cross validation folds, retrain a model using gridsearch on all of the training data\n7.

Using the np.log transformation, the optimization during model training directly optimizes the correct loss function. If we use a custom scorer object, the internal optimization is performed using standard quadratic error functional and we simply evaluate the results using that custom scorer.
