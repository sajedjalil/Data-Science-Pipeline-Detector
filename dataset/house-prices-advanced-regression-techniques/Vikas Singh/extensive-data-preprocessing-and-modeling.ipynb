Checking the Assumption <a id=\"3\"></a>\n\nAccording to Hair et al. (2013), four assumptions should be tested:\n\n* **Normality** - When we talk about normality what we mean is that the data should look like a normal distribution. This is important because several statistic tests rely on this (e.g. t-statistics). In this exercise we'll just check univariate normality for 'SalePrice' (which is a limited approach). Remember that univariate normality doesn't ensure multivariate normality (which is what we would like to have), but it helps. Another detail to take into account is that in big samples (>200 observations) normality is not such an issue. However, if we solve normality, we avoid a lot of other problems (e.g. heteroscedacity) so that's the main reason why we are doing this analysis.\n\n* **Homoscedasticity** - I just hope I wrote it right. Homoscedasticity refers to the 'assumption that dependent variable(s) exhibit equal levels of variance across the range of predictor variable(s)' (Hair et al., 2013). Homoscedasticity is desirable because we want the error term to be the same across all values of the independent variables.\n\n* **Linearity**- The most common way to assess linearity is to examine scatter plots and search for linear patterns. If patterns are not linear, it would be worthwhile to explore data transformations. However, we'll not get into this because most of the scatter plots we've seen appear to have linear relationships.\n\n* **Absence of correlated errors(Multicollineraty)** - Correlated errors, like the definition suggests, happen when one error is correlated to another. For instance, if one positive error makes a negative error systematically, it means that there's a relationship between these variables. This occurs often in time series, where some patterns are time related. We'll also not get into this. However, if you detect something, try to add a variable that can explain the effect you're getting. That's the most common solution for correlated errors."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Correlation Matrix "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corr = train.corr()\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 12))\nsns.heatmap(corr, linewidths=.5, vmin=0, vmax=1, square=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At the first sight light orange colored squares that get my attention, showing strong correlation between 'SalePrice' (depended variable) and  'TotalBsmtSF', 'OverallQual', 'GrLivArea', 'TotalBsmtSF', '1stFlrSF' 'GarageArea' etc( Independed variable)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 'SalePrice' correlation matrix"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"k = 10 #number of variables for heatmap\ncols = corr.nlargest(k, 'SalePrice')['SalePrice'].index\ncm = np.corrcoef(train[cols].values.T)\nsns.set(font_scale=1.25)\nhm = sns.heatmap(cm, cbar=True, annot=True, square=True, fmt='.2f', annot_kws={'size': 10}, yticklabels=cols.values, xticklabels=cols.values)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**These are the variables most correlated with 'SalePrice'.

By now, we should have a idea about the distribution of the variables and the presence of outliers in those variables. For categorical variables mode-imputation is performed and for numerical variable mean-impuation is performed if its distribution is symmetric(or almost symmetric or normal like Age). On the other hand, for a variable with skewed distribution and outliers, meadian-imputation is recommended as median is more immune to outliers than mean.\n\nHowever, one clear disadvantage of using mean, median or mode to impute missing values is the addition of bias if the amount of missing values is significant.

But train accuracy of a model is not enough to tell if a model can be able to generalize the unseen data or not. Because training data is something our model has been trained with, i.e., data our model has already seen it. We all know that, the purpose of building a machine learning model is to generalize the unseen data, i.e., data our model has not yet seen. Hence we can't use training accuracy for our model evaluation rather we must know how our model will perform on the data our model is yet to see.***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* ## 5.2 Model Evaluation <a id=\"5.2\"></a>\nSo basically, to evaluate a model's performance, we need some data (input) for which we know the ground truth(label). For this problem, we don't know the ground truth for the test set but we do know for the train set. So the idea is to train and evaluate the model performance on different data. One thing we can do is to split the train set in two groups, usually in 80:20 ratio. That means we would train our model on 80% of the training data and we reserve the rest 20% for evaluating the model since we know the ground truth for this 20% data. Then we can compare our model prediction with this ground truth (for 20% data). That's how we can tell how our model would perform on unseen data. This is the first model evaluation technique. In sklearn we have a train_test_split method for that. Let's evaluate our model using train_test_split method. **Note: From now on, we will be using root mean squared error (that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value) as the evaluation metric for this problem. So smaller is better.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''Evaluate model on the hold set'''\ndef train_test_split(model):\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(df_train_final, y_train, test_size = 0.3, random_state = seed)\n    model.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n    prediction = model.predict(X_test)\n    mse = mean_squared_error(prediction, Y_test)\n    rmse = np.sqrt(mse) #non-negative square-root\n    return rmse\n\n'''Calculate train_test_split score of differnt models and plot them.'''\nmodels = [lasso, ridge, elnt, kr, dt, svr, knn, pls, rf, et, ab, gb, xgb, lgb]\ntrain_test_split_rmse = []\nfor model in models:\n    train_test_split_rmse.append(train_test_split(model))\n    \n'''Plot data frame of train test rmse'''\ntrain_test_score = pd.DataFrame(data = train_test_split_rmse, columns = ['Train_Test_RMSE'])\ntrain_test_score.index = ['LASSO',  'RIDGE', 'ELNT', 'KR', 'DT', 'SVR', 'KNN', 'PLS', 'RF', 'ET', 'AB', 'GB', 'XGB', 'LGB']\nscatter_plot(train_test_score.index, train_test_score['Train_Test_RMSE'], \"Models' Test Score (RMSE) on Holdout(30%) Set\", 'Models', 'RMSE', 30, 'plotly3')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Being root mean squared error, smaller is better.

Unfortunately, LR(11.02) can't find any linear pattern, hence it performs worst and hence discarded.**\n\nHowever, train_test split has its drawbacks. Because this approach introduces bias as we are not using all of our observations for testing and also we're reducing the train data size. To overcome this we can use a technique called **cross validation** where all the data is used for training and testing periodically. Thus we may reduce the bias introduced by train_test_split. From different cross validation methods, we would use **k-fold cross validation.** In sklearn we have a method cross_val_score for calculating k-fold cross validation score.\n\n### 5.2.1 K-Fold Cross Validation <a id=\"5.2.1\"></a>\nK-Fold is a popular and easy to understand, it generally results in a less biased model compare to other methods. Because it ensures that every observation from the original dataset has the chance of appearing in training and test set. This is one among the best approach if we have a limited input data.\n![](http://analytics.georgetown.edu/sites/gradanalytics/files/styles/georgetown_thumbnail/public/osvald_0.jpg)\n\nLet's say we will use 10-fold cross validation. So k = 10 and we have total 1438 observations. Each fold would have 1438/10 = 143.8 observations. So basically k-fold cross validation uses fold-1 (143.8 samples) as the testing set and k-1 (9 folds) as the training sets and calculates test accuracy.This procedure is repeated k times (if k = 10, then 10 times); each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation or test set.
