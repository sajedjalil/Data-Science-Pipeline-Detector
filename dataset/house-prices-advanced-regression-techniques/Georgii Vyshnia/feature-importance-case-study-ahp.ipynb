Human decision-makers would like to trust their AI-based decision support on the ground of rationale rather than via religious belief in what AI system calculates/suggests/forecasts.\n\nIt was quite easy in good old days when the stage was preoccupied by the easily interpretable ML algorithms (like Linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, CART-based decision trees etc.).\n\nUnfortunately such algorithms lacked accuracy in many real-world business forecasting and decision support scenarios. It resulted in the advent of highly accurate and complicated algorithms (starting from Random Forests through Gradient Boosting Machine-like algorithms up to the wide spectrum of Neural Networks of the second generation). \n\nAs everything in this world, however, the accuracy came at a price. There was no more easy way to interpret the decision-making flow of such AI/ML algorithms in a human-friendly and rational way.\n\nOne of the early attempts to address the challenge was adding the supplementary capability to calculate the feature importance scores by some of the modern algorithms (this is featured, for instance, by Random Forest, GBM, or lightgbm).\n\nThe poor side of the feature importance scores is that they are sometimes confusing / misleading due to the fact they are calculated separately from the ML model training itself.\n\nSuch a collision gave a birth to several analytical algorithms to calculate the feature importance / do the feature selection for ML models. As opposed to the classical statistical (filtering) approaches (where feature importance is determined on a basis of a certain statistical metric, whether it is a Pierson correlation or Chi Square), such techniques embrace a series of model training experiments under certain feature space tweaks. In such a way, they relatively score the importance of each feature for a specific model to train.\n\nIn this notebook, we are going to review and implement such feature selection / feature importance detection methods. They all will be useful in the strive to build the industrial culture of interpretable AI/ML. \n\nWith this direction, we are on a par with the industry giant like Google (who recently launched the services of Explainable AI – see https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai).\n\n**Note**: in addition to building comprehensive interpretable ML models, the relevant feature selection will also help you to handle other ML challenges as follows\n- Dropping the garbage (non-informative) features from your modelling pipeline\n- Tackling the curse of dimensionality as well as minimizing the impact of the model overfitting\n- Improve accuracy/performance of our model forecasting\n\nNow, we are ready to get our hands dirty in the code, to orchestrate a solid ML solution that benefits from industrial feature selection techniques.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Initial

Importance calculation and Feature selection techniques, I would like to briefly outline the essence of each of the methods we are going to use down the road.\n\nIn real machine-learning problems, tackling the curse of dimensionality as well as increasing the model interpretability are translated to solid feature selection techniques.\n\nApart from the filtering-based methods (correlation- or chi-square-based) or PCA (the latter is mostly applicable to linear regression problems), there is a set of analytical (computational) feature selection methods. \n\nIn the subsections below, we will review the available analytical feature selection options, along with the technical implementation details for them in Python.\n\n## Wrapper-based methods\nWrapper-based methods treat the selection of a set of features as a search problem. \n\n**RFE** and its implementation in sckit-learn can be referred to as one of the good options to go on with it, for example. \nThe utility function to benefit from RFE feature importance score calculations is provided below\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/7349198e74b4c5fc6caad18ac150ff07\n\nOther options in the wrapper-based feature selection domain are Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, and Bidirectional Elimination.\n\n## Embedded methods\nEmbedded methods are applicable to ML algorithms that have built-in feature selection methods. For instance, **Lasso, Random Forest, or lightgbm** have them.\n\nFrom the technical standpoint, feature selection with the embedded methods relies on scikit-learn’s SelectFromModel. You can see it in action with the demo code snippet below\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/de775c04f7f752eb66c1d40ed40bcb05\n\n## Permutation method\n\nPut simply, this method changes the data in a column and then tests how much that affects the model accuracy. If changing the data in a column drops the accuracy, then that column is assumed to be important.\n\nYou can benefit from the out-of-the box scikit-learn utility to facilitate permutable feature importance calculation. I wrapped it up in a utility function below\nhttps://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/abe6c06767922f8762bd288c2d897ce5\n\n## Drop-Column Method\n\nThis method is focused on measuring performance of a ML model on a full-feature dataset of predictors vs. the set of smaller datasets (each one of them to drop exactly one feature from the original fully featured dataset). In such a way, the difference between the performance of the model on the original dataset and every dataset with a dropped feature will be a metric of the dropped feature importance for the model performance.\n\nI could not find the stable Pythonic implementation of such a feature selection / feature importance measurement therefore I ended up with the custom implementation below\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/513080f611491b8baa08cc1bf6987144\n\n## Several Practical Considerations\nWhen deciding which feature selection method is the best one for your specific problem, you should keep in mind the points below\n- there is no a single silver bullet-proof method of feature selection that worsks well for each and every project - typically, you will always have to undertake several feature selection experiments (using different methods) to figure out which one leads to the ML model with the highest performance metric score\n- all methods except filter-based ones have its computational time tall, and it may take too much time to go through them appropriately for large datasets\n- embedded methods sometimes introduce the confusion (or even a misinterpretation on the feature importance) as the feature importance scores are often calculated separately from the model training\n\nWith that said, let's get back to coding.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Modelling and Feature Selection Pre-Requisite","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading neccesary packages for modelling and feature selection\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold, cross_validate\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFE, f_regression\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso)\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Setting kfold for future use\nkf = KFold(10, random_state=42, shuffle=True)\n\n# Train our baseline RF Regression model for feature importance scoring/feature selection\nn_trees = 100\nrf = RandomForestRegressor(n_jobs=-1, n_estimators=n_trees, verbose=1)\nrf.fit(X, y)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def rfe_select_featurs(X, y, estimator, num_features) -> List[str]:\n    rfe_selector = RFE(estimator=estimator, \n                       n_features_to_select=num_features, \n                       step=10, verbose=5)\n    rfe_selector.fit(X, y)\n    rfe_support = rfe_selector.get_support()\n    rfe_feature = X.loc[:,rfe_support].columns.tolist()\n    print(str(len(rfe_feature)), 'selected features')\n    \n    return rfe_feature","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# total list of features\ncolnames = X.columns\n# Define dictionary to store our rankings\nranks = {}\n# Create our function which stores the feature rankings to the ranks dictionary\ndef ranking(ranks, names, order=1):\n    minmax = MinMaxScaler()\n    ranks = minmax.fit_transform(order*np.array([ranks]).T).T[0]\n    ranks = map(lambda x: round(x,2), ranks)\n    return dict(zip(names, ranks))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Importance Scores From Model and via RFE","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Do FRE feature importance scoring -
