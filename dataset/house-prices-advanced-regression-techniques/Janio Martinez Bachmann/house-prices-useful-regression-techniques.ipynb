Coming with an accurate model that predicts with such precision the actual value is an arduous task since there are both internal and external factors that will affect the price of a single house. Nevertheless, what we can do is **detect** those features that carry a heavier weight on the overall output (Price of the house). <br><br>\n\nBefore the housing crisis that occurred during the years of (2007-2008), most people believed that the prices of houses tended to go up throughout the years and that people that invested into properties were certain that they will get a return. This was not the case since banks were basically approving loans to people that were not able to afford to pay a house, there were even financial institutions who were approving loans to ordinary individuals at a variable interest rate (meaning rate will change depending on the current market rate) and when the crisis occurred lots of those ordinary individuals were not able to afford to pay back their mortgages. Of course, there were other reasons that caused the financial crisis in the first place such as the introduction of complex financial instruments (*derivatives are still not widely understood*), hedging financial instruments (credit default swaps), and the deregulation of the financial industry as a whole. While we can argue about the factors that caused the financial crisis, the main objective of this post is to determine what possible features could have a real impact on the overall value of a house. We will try to answer questions such as to what extent did the recession impacted the value house prices? What materials were most commonly used with houses that had a high price range? (Rooftop, walls etc.) Which neighborhoods were the most exclusive? <br><br>\n\nI believe that in order to perform an extensive analysis of this data we should explore our data, by this I mean getting a sense of what is the **story behind the data**. Most of the time I tend to reject the idea of just building a model that have a good accuracy score for predicting values instead, I analyze my data carefully (determining distributions, missing values, visualizations) in order to have a better understanding of what is going on. ONly after my extensive analysis I proceed to developing the predictive model, in this case we will use **regression models.** The downside of this to many of you who will see this post, is that it will be somewhat long, so if you think you should **skip** all the sections and start from the regression model step, please feel free to do so! I will create an outline so it will help you find the section you wish to start with. <br><br>\n\n**I'd rather have a full house at a medium price than a half-full at a high price. - George Shinn**\n***"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c6cbbd64-bc2c-48a8-b297-5a4e2e5429bd","_uuid":"e40e74e83039e7eeca270b412107999f7176c1b2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Goal of this Project:\n***\n### Achieving our goal is split into two phases: <br>\n1) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EVA)**: In this phase our main aim is to have a better understanding of the features involved in our data.
