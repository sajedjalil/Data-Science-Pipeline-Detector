Last time I checked there were more than 7000 teams working on it. Obviously there are many public kernels are available, where every team has presented their solution. My objective with this kernel, is to get best possible predictions and leader baord score **without** ensembling my predictions with other top kernels!\n\nI will be publishing two kernels. 'Linear Model' kernel (this one) contains the data preprocessing steps which are most suitable for getting best possible score from Linear Models like Linear Regression, Lasso etc. 'Tree Model' kernel will contain the data preprocessing steps which are most suitable for getting best possible score from Tree Models like Decsion Tree, Random Forest etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Architecture <a id =\"2\"></a>\nIn this kernel I will be using linear model as base model to finalize my data preprocessing steps. I tried multiple outliers removal techniques, encoding techniues, scaling/normalization techniques, feature engineering and different type of imputation combination etc. Everytime I tried these techniques I tested it with linear regression model and after many number of trials I have finalized the final data preprocessing steps that resulted in best possible Linear model score.\n\n![Regression_Architecture.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Regression_Architecture.png)\n\nI have devided my modeling into five steps. \n\n### Step1: Linear Models\nIn this step I used linear models like **Linear Regression**, **Bayesian Ridge Regression**, **Lasso**, **Elastic Net**, **Ridge** etc. For each model I calculated the base model score without hyperparamter tunning and after hyperparameter tunning. I have also submitted the predictions for each model in order to check the Kaggle public leaderboard score. By doing this I can monitor the progress of each step and move forward confidently.\n\n### Step2: Support Vector Machines\nI used **SVR(Support Vector Regressor)**. Similar to linear models for SVR also, I calculated the base model score without hyperparamter tunning and after hyperparameter tunning and also submitted the prediction to get Kaggle public leaderboard score.\n\n### Step3: Ensemble Methods\nIn first two steps I used basic models, from step 3 onward models becomes complex. I used models like **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, **LightGBM Regressor**, **XGB Regressor**. Noted the score with and without hyperparameter tunning and also submitted the prediction to get Kaggle public leaderboard score for each method.\n\n### Step4: Model Stacking\nStacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple regression models via a meta-regressor. At this stage we have good mix of multiple models, now is the best time to use **StackingCVRegressor** to combine all above models to improve the score even further. As expected this model resulted in best possible score!\n\n### Step5: Model Blending\nModel blending is the mannual step, where we manually adjust the weight for each model inorder to ensemble the predictions to improve the score. Thumb rle is to give highest weightes to best performning model and lowest to least perfomring model. After few trial and and error I could settle on the weights and manage to top my model stacking score!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Competition Details <a id =\"3\"></a>\n![housesbanner](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/5407/media/housesbanner.png)\nThere are total **79 explanatory variables** and **1460 training examples** describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. \n\n## Goal <a id =\"4\"></a>\nIt is your job to predict the sales price for each house.

Root Mean square is the standard deviation of the residuals. Now let's understand what Standard deviation and residuals are.\n* **Standard deviation**: Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are. Its formula is the square root of the Variance. Variance is defined as the average of the squared differences from the Mean. In the below formula of standard deviation 'xi'= numbers,  'μ'= Mean of the numbers and 'N' = Total number of values\n\n$$σ = \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ({x_{i}} - μ)^2}$$\n\n* **Residuals**:  Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are. Residuals are nothing but prediction error, we can find it by subtracting the predicted value from actual value.\n![Residuals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Square_Error_Function.png)\n\n* So in order to get RMSE we will use Standard deviation formula but instead of square root of variance we wil calculate the square root of average of squared residuals.\n\n$$RMSE = \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\hat{y_{i}} - y_{i})^2}$$\n \n\n* Standard deviation is used to measure the spread of data around the mean, while RMSE is used to measure distance between predicted and actual values.\n* RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.\n* Since the errors are squared before they are averaged, the RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors. This means the RMSE is most useful when large errors are particularly undesirable. Note that, as per competition rules submissions are evaluated on the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.\n* **What does RMSE indicate?**: \n    * It indicates the absolute fit of the model to the data.\n    * Provides average model prediction error in units of the variable of interest.\n    * They are negatively-oriented scores, which means lower values are better.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries <a id =\"10\"></a>\nImport libraries required for data processing and feature engineering.
