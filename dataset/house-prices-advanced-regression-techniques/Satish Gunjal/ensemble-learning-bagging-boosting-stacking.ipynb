Nowadays we check the reviews on social media or check a YouTube video. Considering other people's opinion just make final decision more informed and make sure to avoid any kind of surprises as we are combining multiple opinions about the same thing together. \n\nEnsemble modeling in machine learning operates on the same principle, where we combine the predictions from multiple models to generate the final model which provide better overall performance. Ensemble modeling helps to generalize the learning based on training data, so that it will be able to do predictions accurately on unknown data. \n\nModeling is one of the most important step in machine learning pipeline. The main motivation behind ensemble learning is to correctly combine weak models to get a more accurate and robust model with bias-variance trade off. For example Random Forest algorithm is ensemble of Decision Tree and since it combine multiple decision  tree models it always perform better than single decision tree model.\n\nDepending on how we combine the base models, ensemble learning can be classified in three different types Bagging, Boosting and  Stacking.\n\n* **Bagging**: The working principle is to build several base models independently and then to average them for final predictions. \n* **Boosting**: Boosting models are built sequentially and tries to reduce the bias on final predictions. \n* **Stacking**: The predictions of each individual model are stacked together and used as input to a final estimator to compute the prediction. \n \nEnsemble learning approach makes the model more robust and helps to achieve the better performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bagging <a id= \"2\"></a>\n\n![EnsembleI_Learning_Bagging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Ensemble_Learning_Bagging.png)\n\n* In bagging we build independent estimators on different samples of the original data set and average or vote across all the predictions.\n* Bagging is a short form of **B*ootstrap *Agg*regat*ing*. It is an ensemble learning approach used to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.\n* Since multiple model predictions are averaged together to form the final predictions, Bagging reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. \n* Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach, in case of regression problem we take mean of the output and in case of classification we take the majority vote. \n* Bagging is more helpfull if we have over fitting (high variance) base models.\n* We can also build independent estimators of same type on each subset. These independent estimators also enable us to parallelly process and increase the speed.\n* Most popular bagging estimator is 'Bagging Tress' also knows as 'Random Forest'\n\n**Bootstrapping**\n* It is a resampling technique, where large numbers of smaller samples of the same size are repeatedly drawn, with replacement, from a single original sample.\n* So this technique will enable us to produce as many subsample as we required from the original training data.\n* So the defination is simple to understand, but \"replacement\" word may be confusing sometimes. Here 'replacement' word signifies that the same obervation may repeat more than once in a given sample, and hence this technique is also known as **sampleing with replacement**\n\n![Bootstrap_Sampling_ML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Bootstrap_Sampling_ML.png)\n\n* As you can see in above image we have training data with observations from X1 to X10. In first bootstrap training sample X6, X10 and X2 are repeated where as in second training sample X3, X4, X7 and X9 are repeated.\n* Bootstrap sampling helps us to generate random sample from given training data for each model in order to genralise the final estimation.\n\nSo in case of Bagging we create multiple number of bootstrap samples from given data to train our base models. Each sample will contain training and test data sets which are different from each other and remember that training sample may contain duplicate observations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Boosting <a id= \"3\"></a>\n* In case of boosting, machine learning models are used one after the other and the predictions made by first layer models are used as input to next layer models. The last layer of models will use the predictions from all previous layers to get the final predictions. \n* So boosting enables each subsequent model to boost the performance of the previous one by overcomming or reducing the error of the previous model.\n* Unlike bagging, in case of boosting the base learners are trained in sequence on a weighted version of the data. Boosting is more helpful if we have biased base models.\n* Boosting can be used to solve regression and classification problems.\n\n![Ensemble_Learning_Boosting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Ensemble_Learning_Boosting.png)\n\nDifferent types of Boosting algorithms\n* Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)\n* Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM)\n* LightGBM\n* CatBoost","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stacking <a id= \"4\"></a>\nModel stacking is a method for combining models to reduce their biases. The predictions of each individual model are stacked together and used as input to a final estimator to compute the prediction. This final estimator is trained through cross-validation.\n\nNote that in case of stacking we use heterogeneous weak learners (different learning algorithms) but in case bagging and boosting we mainly use homogeneous weak learners. \n\n![Ensemble_Learning_Stacking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Ensemble_Learning_Stacking.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# When to use Ensemble Learning?\nSince Ensemble learning results in better accuracy, high consistency and also helps to avoid bias variance tradeoff should'nt we use it everywhere? The short answer is it depends on the problem in hand.
