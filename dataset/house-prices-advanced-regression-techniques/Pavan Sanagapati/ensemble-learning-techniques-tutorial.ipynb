Introduction <a id=\"1\"></a> <br>\n    \nSuppose you wanted to purchase a car.Now by just visiting the first car company and based on the dealer's advise  will we straight away make a buy on a car? Answer is defenitely a big NO right?\n    \n![](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/car-sale-4167169.jpg)\n    \nSo what we do is first decide whether which car to buy ,whether it is a new or used car ,type of car,model and year of manufacture, look for list of dealers ,look for discounts/offers ,customer reviews,opinion from friends and family, performance ,fuel efficiency and obvious any car buyer will for the best price range etc.\n    \n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSC0-mqf3xqr3MESGW-mGwaWQkkBjwJGbNFsQ&usqp=CAU)\n    \n In short, you wouldn’t directly reach a conclusion, but will instead make a decision considering all the above mentioned factors before we decide on the best choice.\n    \n**Ensemble models** in machine learning operate on a similar idea.\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d7/c7/9b/d7c79b0c7abc5a34e17710fe596f6834.jpg)    \nEnsemble Learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models to improve predictive performance compared to a single model. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/L2Jaqm8.png)\n    \n# 2. Ensemble Techniques <a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n\n## 2.1 Max Voting / Voting Classifier <a id=\"2.1\"></a> <br>\n\nThe **max voting** method is generally used for classification problems. In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a ‘vote’. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.\n\nA **Voting Classifier** is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models and predicts an output (class) based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.\nIt simply aggregates the findings of each classifier passed into Voting Classifier and predicts the output class based on the highest majority of voting. The idea is instead of creating separate dedicated models and finding the accuracy for each them, we create a single model which trains by these models and predicts output based on their combined majority of voting for each output class.\n\nNow let us use the IRIS dataset to demonstrate the Voting Classifier","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing libraries \nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier ,BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score \nfrom numpy import mean,std\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score,RepeatedStratifiedKFold,train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression,RidgeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_wine,load_iris\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure\nfigure(num=2, figsize=(16, 12), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest,f_regression\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression,BayesianRidge,ElasticNet,Lasso,SGDRegressor,Ridge\nfrom sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder,OneHotEncoder,RobustScaler,StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline,Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA,KernelPCA\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor,RandomForestRegressor,VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score,KFold,GridSearchCV,RandomizedSearchCV,StratifiedKFold,train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator,clone,TransformerMixin,RegressorMixin\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVR,SVR\n#import xgboost \nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\n#Import Pandas\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\nfrom scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr\n%matplotlib inline\nseed = 1075\nnp.random.seed(seed)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# loading iris dataset \niris = load_iris() \nX = iris.data[:, :4] \nY = iris.target ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,Y,test_size = 0.20,random_state = 42) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Ensemble of Models \nestimator = [] \nestimator.append(('LR',LogisticRegression(solver ='lbfgs',multi_class ='multinomial',max_iter = 200))) \nestimator.append(('SVC', SVC(gamma ='auto', probability = True))) \nestimator.append(('DTC', DecisionTreeClassifier())) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Voting Classifier** supports two types of votings.\n\n**Hard Voting:** In hard voting, the predicted output class is a class with the highest majority of votes i.e the class which had the highest probability of being predicted by each of the classifiers.

In this method, we take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction. Averaging can be used for making predictions in regression problems or while calculating probabilities for classification problems.\n\nThe simplest way to develop a model averaging ensemble in Keras is to train multiple models on the same dataset then combine the predictions from each of the trained models.\n\nWe will use a small multi-class classification problem as the basis to demonstrate a model averaging ensemble.\n\nThe scikit-learn class provides the make_blobs() function that can be used to create a multi-class classification problem with the prescribed number of samples, input variables, classes, and variance of samples within a class.\n\nWe use this problem with 500 examples, with input variables to represent the x and y coordinates of the points and a standard deviation of 2.0 for points within each group. We will use the same random state to ensure that we always get the same 500 points.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nfrom pandas import DataFrame","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# generate 2d classification dataset\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples=500, centers=3, n_features=2, cluster_std=2, random_state=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# scatter plot, dots colored by class value\ndf = DataFrame(dict(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], label=y))\ncolors = {0:'red', 1:'blue', 2:'green'}\nfig, ax = pyplot.subplots()\ngrouped = df.groupby('label')\nfor key, group in grouped:\n    group.plot(ax=ax, kind='scatter', x='x', y='y', label=key, color=colors[key])\npyplot.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the standard deviation of 2.0 means that the classes are not linearly separable (separable by a line) causing many ambiguous points.\n\n**So in summary for every instance of test dataset, the average predictions are calculated. This method often reduces overfit and creates a smoother regression model.**\n\n## 2.3 Weighted Averaging <a id=\"2.3\"></a> <br>\nThis is an extension of the averaging method. All models are assigned different weights defining the importance of each model for prediction. \n![](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-22-at-6.40.37-pm.png)\n\nFor this we will use the housing prices dataset to demonstrate as shown below\n\nFirstly import the libraries & data ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv',na_values = '#NAME?')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test.csv',na_values = '#NAME?')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"    Based on the distribution of data let us remove some of the outliers","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.drop(train[(train['GrLivArea'] >4000) & (train['SalePrice']<300000)].index,inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us concatenate both the training and test datasets into a single dataframe for ease of data cleaning and feature engineering.'Id' feature has no significance to our modelling since it is a continuous variable ,so dropping this feature on both train and test datasets.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full = pd.concat([train,test],ignore_index=True)\nfull.drop('Id',axis = 1,inplace = True)\nfull.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us preprocess the data by doing some missing values treatment","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"missing_values = full.isnull().sum()\nmissing_values[missing_values>0].sort_values(ascending = False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"let us impute the missing values of LotFrontage based on the median of LotArea and Neighborhood.

(for example decision tree, knn or svm) to build a new model. This model is used for making predictions on the test set.\n\nStacking, also known as Stacked Generalization is an ensemble technique that combines multiple classifications or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor.

The base-level often consists of different learning algorithms and therefore stacking ensembles are often heterogeneous. Here is a diagram illustrating the process\n\nBelow is a step-wise explanation for a simple stacked ensemble:\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324552457/figure/fig3/AS:616245728645121@1523935839872/An-example-scheme-of-stacking-ensemble-learning.png)\n\nStep 1:The train set is split into 10 parts.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image-11-300x217.png)\nStep 2:A base model (suppose a decision tree) is fitted on 9 parts and predictions are made for the 10th part. This is done for each part of the train set.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image-10-300x249.png)\nStep 3:The base model (in this case, decision tree) is then fitted on the whole train dataset.\n\nStep 4:Using this model, predictions are made on the test set.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image-2-300x225.png)\nStep 5:Steps 2 to 4 are repeated for another base model (say knn) resulting in another set of predictions for the train set and test set.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image-3-300x224.png)\nStep 6:The predictions from the train set are used as features to build a new model.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image12-292x300.png)\n\nStep 7:This model is used to make final predictions on the test prediction set.\n\n\nIn order to simplify the above explanation, the stacking model we have created has only two levels.

Bootstrapping is a method to help decrease the variance of the classifier and reduce overfitting, by resampling data from the training set with the same cardinality as the original set. The model created should be less overfitted than a single individual model.\n\nA high variance for a model is not good, suggesting its performance is sensitive to the training data provided. So, even if more the training data is provided, the model may still perform poorly. And, may not even reduce the variance of our model.\n\nBagging is an effective method when you have limited data, and by using samples you’re able to get an estimate by aggregating the scores over many samples.\n\nThe simplest approach with bagging is to use a couple of small subsamples and bag them, if the ensemble accuracy is much higher than the base models, it’s working; if not, use larger subsamples.Using larger subsamples is not guaranteed to improve your results. In bagging there is a tradeoff between base model accuracy and the gain you get through bagging. The aggregation from bagging may improve the ensemble greatly when you have an unstable model, yet when your base models are more stable — been trained on larger subsamples with higher accuracy — improvements from bagging reduces.\n\nOnce the bagging is done, and all the models have been created on (mostly) different data, a weighted average is then used to determine the final score.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1*JksRZ1E72Rsx2s8lQbNR1w.jpeg)\n\nThere are three main terms describing the ensemble (combination) of various models into one more effective model:\n\n* **Bagging** to decrease the model’s variance;\n* **Boosting** to decreasing the model’s bias, and;\n* **Stacking** to increasing the predictive force of the classifier.\n\nThe idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Here’s a question: If you create all the models on the same set of data and combine it, will it be useful? There is a high chance that these models will give the same result since they are getting the same input. So how can we solve this problem? One of the techniques is bootstrapping.\n\nBootstrapping is a sampling technique in which we create subsets of observations from the original dataset, with replacement. The size of the subsets is the same as the size of the original set.\n\nBagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses these subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set). The size of subsets created for bagging may be less than the original set.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image20-768x289.png)\n\nStep 1: Multiple subsets are created from the original dataset, selecting observations with replacement.\n\nStep 2: A base model (weak model) is created on each of these subsets.\n\nStep 3: The models run in parallel and are independent of each other.\n\nStep 4: The final predictions are determined by combining the predictions from all the models.\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-from-2018-05-08-13-11-49-768x580.png)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.datasets import load_wine\n# define dataset\nX,y = load_wine().data,load_wine().target","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create classifiers\nrf = RandomForestClassifier()\net = ExtraTreesClassifier()\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nsvc = SVC()\nrg = RidgeClassifier()\nclf_array = [rf, et, knn, svc, rg]\nfor clf in clf_array:\n    vanilla_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=10, n_jobs=-1)\n    bagging_clf = BaggingClassifier(clf,max_samples=0.4, max_features=10, random_state=seed)\n    bagging_scores = cross_val_score(bagging_clf, X, y, cv=10,n_jobs=-1)\n    \n    print (\"Mean of: {1:.3f}, std: (+/-) {2:.3f} [{0}]\".format(clf.__class__.__name__,vanilla_scores.mean(), vanilla_scores.std()))\n    print (\"Mean of: {1:.3f}, std: (+/-) {2:.3f} [Bagging {0}]\\n\".format(clf.__class__.__name__,bagging_scores.mean(), bagging_scores.std()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In all but one of the classifiers, we had lower variance as shown above . As well, the accuracy of classifiers all increased except for SVC. Looks like this bagging thing actually works. \n\nSo our bagged individual classifiers are (mostly) better, but which one do we choose?\n\n**Let’s Vote!**\n\nSklearn’s **VotingClassifier** allows you to combine different machine learning classifiers, and perform a vote on what the predicted class label(s) are for a record.\n\nThere are two types of voting you can do for classifiers: hard and soft.\n\nWith hard voting, you just need a majority of classifiers to determine what the result could be. As with the image below, the various bagged models are shown with H, and the results of the classifiers are shown on the rows. On the far right, H1 and H3 vote for the first record to be “no” (purple) while H2 votes for “yes” (yellow). Because 2 of the models vote for “no”, the ensemble classifies that record as a “no”.\n\n\nWith soft (weighted), we compute a percentage weight with each classifier. A predicted class probability from each model for each record is collected and multiplied by the classifier weight, and finally averaged. The final class label is then derived from the class label with the highest average probability.\n\nIn reality weights are hard to find if you’re just providing your best guesses to which model you think should be weighted more or less. To counter this subjective process, a linear optimization equation or neural net could be constructed to find the correct weighting for each of the models to optimize the accuracy of the ensemble.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\nclf = [rf, et, knn, svc, rg]\neclf = VotingClassifier(estimators=[('Random Forests', rf), ('Extra Trees', et), ('KNeighbors', knn), ('SVC', svc), ('Ridge Classifier', rg)], voting='hard')\nfor clf, label in zip([rf, et, knn, svc, rg, eclf], ['Random Forest', 'Extra Trees', 'KNeighbors', 'SVC', 'Ridge Classifier', 'Ensemble']):\n    scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=10, scoring='accuracy')\n    print(\"Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f) [%s]\" % (scores.mean(), scores.std(), label))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With our bagged ensemble results shown above, we have an increase in accuracy and a decrease in variance, so our ensemble model is working as expected after we’ve combined all the various models into one.\n\nNow that we know how well our model(s) are doing individually and together, does that actually look.

Previously with bagging, we averaged each individual model created. This time with each iteration of boosting, a new model is created and the new base-learner model is trained (updated) from the errors of the previous learners.\n\nThe algorithm creates multiple weak models whose output is added together to get an overall prediction. This is ensemble modelling from earlier. The now boosted gradient shifts the current prediction nudging it to the true target, in a similar fashion to how gradient descent moves toward the true values. The gradient descent optimization occurs on the output of the varies models, and not their individual parameters.\n\nThere are different methods to optimize boosting algorithms.\nUnlike the bagging examples above, classical boosting the subset creation is not random and performance will depend upon the performance of previous models. As, each new subset which is iterated upon contains elements which could have been misclassified by previous models. We will also be using the same hard voting we used previously to ensemble the models together.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.datasets import load_wine\n# define dataset\nX,y = load_wine().data,load_wine().target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Adaptive boosting** or **AdaBoost** is one of the simplest boosting algorithms.
