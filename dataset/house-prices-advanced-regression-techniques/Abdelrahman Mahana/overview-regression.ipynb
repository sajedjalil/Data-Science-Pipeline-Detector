The goal is to discuss the main features of a number of regression algorithms without going into too much detail, and demonstrate how they are implemented in python. Since this is intended for my own personal use, the questions and confusions I address will be unique to my own background and experience. Nonetheless, I hope that others studying to enter data science will find this a convenient reference in their own data science journeys. Questions and comments are always appreciated! For those that found this notebook useful, I also recommend refering to my notes on classification algorithms, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelgeracie/modelling-overview-classification).\n\nWe will use the following conventions throughout. The training data is given by a set of $m$ numerical features $\\mathbf x_j \\in \\mathbb R^n$ where $j = \\{ 1 , \\dots , m \\}$. We will sometimes denote feature vectors using the bold face vector notation just given, and sometimes use components. The $i$th feature of the $j$th training sample is then $x_{ij} = (\\mathbf x_j )_i$ where $i \\in \\{ 1 , \\dots , n\\}$. The features may be real valued or categorical, and if the $i$th feature is categorical, that component will be labelled by some subset $ C \\subseteq \\mathbb Z$ of the integers. \n\n## 1) Linear Regression\n## 2) Ridge Regression\n## 3) Lasso Regression\n## 4) Decision Trees\n## 5) Random Forests\n## 6) Support Vector Regression\n## 7) XGBoost Regression\n## 8) AdaBoost Regression\n\nThe following is the standard code to start up a notebook"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for creating plots\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Linear Regression\n\nIn linear regression we seak to predict a dependent variable $y$ as a linear function of the independent variables $\\mathbf x$\n\n\\begin{align}\n    y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots \\beta_n x_n.\n\\end{align}\n\nIt is customary in this setup to append a $1$ onto the feature fector so that $\\mathbf x = ( 1 ~ x_1 ~ \\cdots ~ x_n)^T$, the coefficients are then $\\mathbf \\beta = ( \\beta_0 ~ \\beta_1 ~ \\cdots ~ \\beta_n )^T$ and we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n    y = \\mathbf \\beta^T \\mathbf x .\n\\end{align}\n\nGiven some training data, we seek to choose a \"best\" $\\mathbf \\beta$ where by best we mean that it minimizes some loss function. By far the most common loss function, and the one used exclusively by `sklean.LinearRegression` is the sum of squares\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L(\\mathbf \\beta ) &= \\frac 1 m \\sum_{j=1}^m ( \\mathbf \\beta^T \\mathbf x_j- y_j)^2 \n    = \\frac 1 m || X \\beta - y ||^2\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf y = ( y_1 ~ \\cdots ~ y_m)^T$ and $X_{ji} = (\\mathbf x_j)_i = x_{ij} $ is a $m \\times n$ matrix. That is, we compare each data point in the training set to the models prediction, square the difference, and take the average. This is distinguished from ridge and lasso regression, covered later in this notebook, by the lack of a \"regularization term\" intended to suppress the magnitude of the coefficients and reduce over-fitting.\n\nThe argmin of the loss function is given by the closed form expression\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathbf \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\mathbf y .\n\\end{align}\n\nSee [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20linear%20regression%20is,as%20dependent%20and%20independent%20variables) or [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares) for details.\n\nThe fit to the data is often measured by the so-called $R^2$. This is defined as\n\n\\begin{align}\n    R^2 = 1 - \\frac{u}{v} .\n\\end{align}\n\nHere $u$ is the loss function evaluated on the training data. In the above formula, this is measured relative to the scale\n\n\\begin{align}\n    v = \\frac 1 m \\sum_{j=1}^m  ( y_j- y_\\text{mean})^2\n\\end{align}\n\nfor a unitless measure. Note that $R^2 \\leq 1$ and an $R^2$ of $1$ indicates a perfect fit. It may however go arbitrarily negative as the fit gets worse. Note that it has been normalized so that a straight line through the mean $y = y_\\text{mean}$ has $R^2 = 0$.\n\n### Pros\n* Simplicity\n\n### Cons\n\n* Loss function sensitive to outliers\n* Loss function not unit free, so the model will be sensitive to errors that are large in magnitude, even if they represent a small percentage error\n* computationally expensive since need to invert the matrix $X^T X$, which takes time of order $O(n_\\text{samples} n_{features}^2)$\n* if have highly correlated features (a common situation when there are a large number of parameters), the model can be highly sensitive to random errors since $det (X^T X)$ nearly $0$. The computation of the inverse is then highly sensitive to these errors and performance can be easily affected. This problem is often refered to as called \"multicollinearity\"\n* if $n_\\text{samples} < n_\\text{features}$ do not have enough info to fit the model we since need to invert singular matrix\n\nThe multi-collinearity problem can be solved by using gradient descent to find the best fit, removing features with high collinearity, or using one of the regularized models introduced below."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example\n\nAs an example we use data from the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) challenge.

As we shall see, ridge and lasso regression will tend to emphasize the features that are most relevant, with lasso regression in particular completely discarding features it deems much less important than the others.\n\nFor now, let's simply take the model as given us and plot it against the training data for a single feature to see how we did. Note that if we want the data in the original scale, we need to scale it back.

By adding a regularizing term to the loss function we can diminish this problem at the cost of some bias. For ridge regression we use the loss function\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L(\\mathbf \\beta ) =||X \\beta - y||_2^2 + \\alpha || \\beta ||_2^2.\n\\end{align}\n\nHere $||\\mathbf x||_p = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p\\right)^{1/p}$ is the so-called $L^p$ norm on $\\mathbb R^n$.\nThe regularization term counters the tendancy for $\\beta$ to become too large when we have multi-collinearity: we would like to diminish the dependence on the less important feature. The optimal weight vector is given by\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\beta = (X^T X - \\alpha)^{-1} X^T y .\n\\end{align}\n\nWe see that $\\alpha$ adds a small amount to the diagonal of the matrix to be inverted, making it less singular and reducing the risk of collinearity.\n\n## Geometric Interpretation\n    \nThe regularization term has a useful geometric interpretation that will help in our understanding of lasso regression. Consider the alternate constrained optimization problem\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{minimize} ~ &L(\\mathbf \\beta ) =||X \\beta - y||_2^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} ~ &|| \\beta ||_2^2 \\leq t\n\\end{align}\n\nThis minimization problem prevents $\\beta$ from being too large, as a result, certain features are deemphasized and only the most important ones are given weight.\n\nIt turns out this optimization problem is related to the one given above. Carrying out the minimization proceedure we find that\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n\\end{align}\n\nif the minimum is such that $||(X^T X)^{-1} X^T y ||_2^2 \\leq t$. If the minimum value of $\\beta$ is such that it does not lie within the ball of radius $t^{1/2}$, then the best we can do in the inequality constrained optimization problem is to be on the boundary. That is, the problem becomes a constrained optimization problem, solved by introducing lagrange multipliers\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L = ||X \\beta - y||_2^2 + \\alpha (||\\beta||_2^2 - t) .\n\\end{align}\n\nMinimizing this we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n    &|| \\beta ||_2^2 - t = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\\n    &\\beta = (X^T X - \\alpha)^{-1} X^T y .\n\\end{align}\n\nThere is a unique $\\alpha$ for which this can be solved, which we denote $\\alpha_t$.\n\nHence, the constrained problem gives the solution to the least-mean-squares problem if $\\beta$ doesn't get too big. However, when the minimum is far enough away from the origin, the problem is equivalent to ridge regression where the regularization parameter of ridge regression is related to $t$ in some way. Note that this relationship is dependent on the training data $(X,y)$. In the ridge regression problem, for $\\beta_\\text{LMSE}$ sufficiently far out, we get a $\\beta$ lying on the surface of the sphere of radius-squared $t_\\alpha$.\n\nWe'll delay the example for ridge regression until we have also covered lasso regression since it is instructive to compare them.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Lasso regression\n\nLasso regression is the same as ridge regression, but with a different measure for the regularization term. Again, see [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lasso) or [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) for details. The loss function to be minimized is\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L ( \\beta ) = \\frac{1}{2 n_\\text{samples}} || X \\beta - y ||_2^2 + \\alpha || \\beta ||_1,\n\\end{align}\n\nintroducing an $L^1$ norm cost to the slope of the linear model.\n\nThe idea behind this loss function can be more easily understood given the geometric interpretation above. For $||\\beta||_1$ sufficiently large, this is equivalent to the constrained optimization problem\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{minimize} ~ &L(\\mathbf \\beta ) =||X \\beta - y||_2^2 \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\text{subject to} ~ &|| \\beta ||_1 \\leq t\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere there is some relationship between $\\alpha$ and $t$ which isn't important. The advantages of this metric come from the shape of the region $\\|| \\beta ||_1 \\leq t$, which is a $n$-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin with vertices on the axes. The fact that the vertices are on the axes and edges on zero planes is the essential point: $\\beta$ will try to get as close as it can (in the $L^2$-norm) to the value given by minimizing the LMSE subject to being on this cubical surface. That will tend to be near vertices or edges, which extend farther from the origin in the $L^2$-norm, but tend to lie on zero planes, thus setting many less important features to zero *exactly*, while emphasizing the more important ones (compared to ridge regression). The geometric intuition can be seen pictured below.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/L1_and_L2_balls.svg\">\n\nHence the regularization not only improves generalizability of the model by discouraging over-fitting, it also aids in the interpretability of a model with a complicated feature set by exactly discarding the least important features.\n\nNote that since lasso has no closed form expression for the optimal coefficient vector, this is found via gradient descent."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Example (Linear vs Ridge vs Lasso)\n\nFinally, let's return to the example that we used in standard linear regression, drawing on data from the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.

Hence we will be brief in our outline and refer to our [classification notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelgeracie/modelling-overview-classification) for more details. Starting from the root node the algorithm checks all possible splitings and picks the one which \"organizes\" the data the best, that is, leads to the most homogeneous branches. Homogeneity is measured by some impurity measure which we hope to minimize. `sklearn`'s implementation gives three choices for this impurity measure, fixed by the `criterion` parameter, the mean-squared-error (`'mse'`), the mean-absolute-error (`'mae'`), and the Friedman mean-squared error (`'friedman_mse'`) (we'll skip this one for now). The first two are simply the $L^2$ and $L^1 norms of the error\n\n\\begin{align}\n    H(Q) = \\sqrt ( \\frac 1 n \\sum_Q (y - \\bar y)^2 ),\n    \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad\n    H(Q) = \\frac 1 n \\sum_Q | y - \\bar y |\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\bar y$ is the mean of the training data and the sum is over all training samples $Q$ that fall into the resulting leaf. The $L^2$ error is of course just the standard deviation. The \"gain\" of a split is given by\n\n$$G(Q,\\theta)= H(Q) - \\frac{|Q_\\text{L} (\\theta)|}{|Q|} H (Q_\\text{L} (\\theta)) - \\frac{|Q_\\text{R} (\\theta)|}{|Q|} H (Q_\\text{R} (\\theta))$$\n\nHere, as in our classification notebook, $\\theta = (i , \\theta_i)$ is a split of the $i$th feature into sets of training data with that feature greater than or less than $\\theta_i$. These sets are denoted as\n\n$$Q_\\text{L} (\\theta) = \\{ j \\in Q | x_{ij} \\leq \\theta_i \\} ,$$\n$$Q_\\text{R} (\\theta)= \\{ j \\in Q | x_{ij} > \\theta_i \\} .$$\n\nWe then iterate through the tree as in the classification problem, choosing the best split, that is the one maximizing the gain at each stage until we are out of features, every leaf is homogeneous, or a stopping condition has been reached. In the end, we have a decision tree that has organized the data into more homogeneous leaves.

This randomness greatly reduces variance in the predictions at a slight cost in bias and so is a good way to prevent overfiting. Randomness is introduced to the model in two ways:\n\n1) Only train on a randomly selected subset of the training data (with replacement). This is called \"bootstraping\" and is a general method to generate \"new data\" for training to create lower variance models. Sub-sample size is controlled with the `max_samples` parameter if `bootstrap=True`. This can be an integer number of samples, or a float between 0 and 1, in which case it is interpreted as a fraction of samples to use from the training data.\n\n2) In training each tree, only use a randomly selected subset of features of size `max_features` when deciding on how to split a node.\n\nNumerical results from the different decision trees are then averaged weighted by the probability that each tree gives for being in each class of the classification problem. This is called 'bagging'.

Note that the effect of $\\gamma$ is to give a bias to the gain function, so that larger values of $\\gamma$ tend to prune the tree and prevent over-fitting. Similarly, larger values of $\\lambda$ decrease the positive contributions to the gain and so discourage adding new branches.\n\nApparently, XGBoost only accounts for $\\gamma$ after the tree is made, not at each step. Hence the tree is constructed as if $\\gamma$ were zero, and then one goes back and looks at all of the lowest descision nodes. If the gain is greater than $\\gamma$, that decision node is maintained, otherwise it is removed. We then proceed up the tree in this way.

It is a boosting algorithm that generates an ensemble of learners, each iteratively generated to correct the predictions of the previous ensemble, and is destinguished by it's adaptive nature. By this we mean that in each successive iteration, the training examples are reweighted so that misclassified samples are more influential. In this way, the algorithm does not waste time learning patterns it is already good at, and instead moves on to more difficult to identify patterns. The model contains elements of gradient boosting in that each successive learner is added to the ensemble in a manner that minimizes some predetermined loss function, but also involves elements of bagging, in that each individual learner is trained on a sample drawn from the original training data with replacement. It is in the bagging where the model focusses on misclassified samples as they are not drawn from the original training set with a uniform distribution, but with an iteratively generated probability distribution that puts weight on difficult to classify training instances. Altogether then the model is an ad-hoc jumble of different techniques, though with a simple overall philosphy.\n\nThe regression version of this model works very much in the same way, with some similarly ad-hoc modifications to adapt this philosophy to a regression setting. As such, we will briefly overview the SAMME algorithm for AdaBoost classification first, and then introduce the changes necessary for regression, first found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harris_Drucker/publication/2424244_Improving_Regressors_Using_Boosting_Techniques/links/0deec51ae736538cec000000/Improving-Regressors-Using-Boosting-Techniques.pdf)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## SAMME\n\nConsider a classification problem where the possible results are labelled by $k \\in C$ and the number of possible classes is $|C| = K$.\n\nIn the SAMME algorithm we initialize uniform weights to the training samples $w^{(1)}_i = 1/n$. We then repeat the following steps for a given number of iterations or until some pruning condition has been met. On the $m$th iteration\n* Draw $n$ samples from the training data with probability distribution $w^{(m)}_i$ and fit a classifier $T^{(m)}(\\mathbf x)$ to it\n* Evaluate the \"weighted error\" of the classifier\n    \\begin{align}\n        \\epsilon_m = \\sum_{i}^n w^{(m)}_i I \\left( y_i \\neq T^{(m)} (\\mathbf x_i )\\right)\n        \\qquad \\text{and let} \\qquad\n        \\beta_m = (K-1) \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_m}{\\epsilon_m} .\n    \\end{align}\n    Here $I$ is the \"identifier\" function that returns 1 if the argument is true and 0 if it is false.\n    In other words, the sum is over samples misclassified by $T^{(m)}$.\n* If $\\mathbf x_i$ is misclassified by $T^{(m)}(\\mathbf x)$, set\n    \\begin{align}\n        w^{(m+1)}_i = w^{(m)}_i \\beta_m\n    \\end{align}\n    otherwise, leave it the same $w^{(m+1)}_i = w^{(m)}_i$. Then renormalize $w^{(m+1)}_i$ to sum to 1.\n\nNote that the error rate of the $m$th classifier satisfies $0 \\leq \\epsilon_m \\leq 1$. If it is greater than $1 - \\frac 1 K$, the factor $\\beta_m$ is less than 1 and misclassified samples are de-emphasized ($T^{(m)}$ is judged to not be an improvement and we stop emphasizing the samples it was trained off of). If it is less than $1 - \\frac 1 K$, then $\\beta_m > 1$. Progress has been made, and the factor $\\beta_m$ emphasizes those samples that are still misclassified at the $m$th step.\n\nOnce run a sufficient number of times, a final prediction is made by the ensemble in the following way\n\\begin{align}\n    T ( \\mathbf x ) = \\text{argmax}_{k \\in C} \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^M \\beta_m I ( k = T^{(m)} ( \\mathbf x ) ) \\right) .\n\\end{align}\nIn other words, given $\\mathbf x$, the classifier returns that class for which the ensemble of classifiers has the highest \"total confidence\", where the confidence of each classifier is measured by $\\beta_m$.\n\nNote that each individual classifier is trained via bagging. It may not be obvious, but the way in which they are added together in the end is actually gradient boosting with a given loss function. Details on this can be found in our note on classification."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Drucker's modification for regression problems\n\nDrucker adapted this algorithm for regression problems by choosing a \"weighted error\" loss function for evaluating each learner $T^{(m)} (\\mathbf x)$ that is appropriate to regression (actually he gives three options and others are possible). Weights are then updated in the same way. The final output should not be a class but a real number. He chooses to take the weighted median of the ensemble of predictors, again, each weighted by its \"confidence\" $\\beta_m$.\n\nIn more detail, we proceed as follows. First, initialize weights for the training samples $w^{(1)}_i = \\frac 1 n$. then repeat the following steps for a given number of iterations or until a pruning condition has been reached (for Drucker, we repeat while $\\beta_m \\geq \\frac 1 2$). On the $m$th iteration\n\n* Draw $n$ samples from the training data with probability distribution $w^{(m)}_i$ and fit a regressor $y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x)$ to this data.\n\n* Let $L(y, y')$ be a loss function of any functional form, so long as $L^{(m)}_i = L(y_i, y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x_i))$ is such that $L^{(m)}_i \\in [ 0 , 1 ]$, is zero when $y_i = y^{(m)}_i$, and increases monotonically to 1 as the prediction gets further away from the actual result. Some examples are the linear, squared, and exponential loss\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{| y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x_i ) - y_i|}{D}, \\qquad\n    \\frac{| y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x_i ) - y_i|^2}{D^2}, \\qquad\n    1 - \\text{exp} \\left( -\n    \\frac{| y^{(m)} ( \\mathbf x_i ) - y_i|}{D}\\right) ,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $D = \\text{sup}_i | y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x_i ) - y_i|$\n\n* The \"average loss\" for the regressor $y^{(m)}(\\mathbf x)$ is then $L^{(m)} = \\sum_{i=1}^N L^{(m)}_i w^{(m)}_i$. The \"confidence\" of the regressor is obtained from the average loss as\n\\begin{align}\n    \\beta_m = \\frac{1 - L^{(m)}}{L^{(m)}} .\n\\end{align}\nAs in the SAMME algorithm, $\\beta_m$ is greater than 1 when the loss is less than $1/2$ and less than 1 when the loss is greater than $1/2$.\n\n* Update the weights as\n\\begin{align}\n    w^{(m+1)}_i = w^{(m)}_i \\beta_m^{L^{(m)}_i - 1} \n\\end{align}\nand re-normalize so that they sum to 1. When the confidence $\\beta_m$ of the $m$th regressor is greater than one, this updating emphasizes training examples exponentially in how far away the $m$th regressors predicted value is from the actual value of the training sample. When the confidence is less then one, it suppresses them exponentially.\n\nOnce all of the individual learners have been trained, the final regressor $y ( \\mathbf x)$ takes their weighted median. By this, we mean that we give the regressor $y^{(m)} (\\mathbf x )$ a probability mass $\\ln \\beta_m$ (suitably normalized), and take the median in this probability distribution. The preference for weighted medians over weighted means seems to simply be a choice by Drucker, one that is in fact used in `sklearn`'s implementation of AdaBoost regression.\n\nNote that $\\ln \\beta_m$ makes sense as a probability mass function since according to Drucker's original stopping criterion, $\\beta_m$ is never allowed to go less than 1."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"TO DO: python example"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
