The base notebook that came from the bonus lesson of this course was extensively modified/expanded. The goal was to learn as much as possible about feature engineering, using only XGBoost. If you want to do the same, I recommend you do NOT just run this notebook . . . but rather start with the bonus lesson as your base code and gradually experiment over the course of a week or two like I did, perhaps glancing at this notebook from time to time to get inspired with new ideas.\n\nAfter weeks of experimentation with many forms of feature engineering, this notebook ended up with a very good score, possibly the best score on the leaderboard that uses only XGBoost. If getting the best score were the goal, next steps would be to experiment with other types of models besides XGboost. Then, you'd want to blend and/or stack several models together.\n\n## Data Preprocessing ##\n\nBefore we can do any feature engineering, we need to *preprocess* the data to get it in a form suitable for analysis. The feature engineering course data was simpler than this competition data. For the *Ames* competition dataset, we'll need to:\n- **Load** the data from CSV files\n- **Clean** the data to fix any errors or inconsistencies\n- **Encode** the statistical data type (numeric, categorical)\n- **Impute** any missing values\n\nThese steps are wrapped in a function, which makes it easy to get a fresh dataframe when needed. After reading the CSV file, we'll apply three preprocessing steps, `clean`, `encode`, and `impute`, and then create the data splits: one (`df_train`) for training the model, and one (`df_test`) for making the predictions for the leaderboard test set.\n\nThe base code for all this was provided in the bonus lesson (from Kaggle's feature engineering course), but was extensively modified (Kaggle user FilterJoe) to include:\n\n- verbose flags: summary of each step in preprocessing and feature engineering is displayed when called with verbose=True\n- one-hot encoding function\n- feature dropping function\n- added/customized features (kept only those that boosted score)\n- improvements to imputation strategies\n- experimented with Boruta-SHAP feature selection (commented out as it always hurt XGBoost score a little)\n- feature importances output from XGBoost (used this info to test dropping features of low importance to XGBoost)\n- I did a bunch of EDA, but it's in a different notebook to keep this notebook smaller\n\n\n## Load and Clean ##","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preprocessing steps collected together into this one function, then defined seperately in following cells\n\ndef preprocess_data(verbose=False):\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"*** BEGIN PREPROCESSING ***\")\n    data_directory = Path(\"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/\")\n    df, train_indices, test_indices = load(data_directory, verbose)\n    df = clean(df, verbose)\n    df = order_ordinals(df, verbose)\n    df = encode_nominative_categoricals(df, verbose)\n    df = impute(df, verbose)\n\n    df_train = df.loc[train_indices, :] # Reform splits: train\n    df_test = df.loc[test_indices, :] # Reform splits: test\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"*** END PREPROCESSING ***\\n\")\n    return df_train, df_test","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T17:13:57.268665Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T17:13:57.268964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T17:13:57.278233Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T17:13:57.268933Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T17:13:57.276817Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# LOAD: read and merge\n\ndef load(data_dir, verbose):\n    df_train = pd.read_csv(data_dir / \"train.csv\", index_col=\"Id\")  # read_csv assumes first column is index, which you can name w/index_col\n    df_test = pd.read_csv(data_dir / \"test.csv\", index_col=\"Id\")  # use the (better be!) unique Ids to merge and split as needed\n    df = pd.concat([df_train, df_test]) # Merge splits, so can preprocess (clean, encode, impute) together\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Train and test splits read from CSV and merged.\")\n        print(\"Missing values before any preprocessing: \", df.isnull().values.sum())\n    return df, df_train.index, df_test.index","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T17:13:58.510055Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T17:13:58.510415Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T17:13:58.518217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T17:13:58.510383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T17:13:58.517067Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# CLEAN: Examine data_description.txt further ...

If you want to develop intuition about feature engineering and a good experimentation mindset, it's great to take advantage of being able to submit up to 10 times per day. And you don't have to submit - if you're validation score gets a lot worse from adding or changing a feature, than you probably won't want to bother seeing if the score also gets worse on the leaderboard.\n\nFollowing this hidden cell is the final set of hyperparameters for XGBoost, which is fed data that has already been through the feature engineering pipeline. It took weeks of experimentation to get to a pure XGBoost model (no blending) to score so well:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# xgb_params = dict(\n#     max_depth=4,           # maximum depth of each tree - try 2 to 10\n#     learning_rate=0.01,    # effect of each tree - try 0.0001 to 0.1\n#     n_estimators=2800,     # number of trees (that is, boosting rounds) - try 1000 to 8000\n#     min_child_weight=1,    # minimum number of houses in a leaf - try 1 to 10\n#     colsample_bytree=0.5,  # fraction of features (columns) per tree - try 0.2 to 1.0\n#     subsample=0.7,         # fraction of instances (rows) per tree - try 0.2 to 1.0\n#     reg_alpha=0.5,         # L1 regularization (like LASSO) - try 0.0 to 10.0\n#     reg_lambda=1.0,        # L2 regularization (like Ridge) - try 0.0 to 10.0\n#     num_parallel_tree=1,   # set > 1 for boosted random forests\n# )\n        \n# v9 trial 3/10, 4508 n_est, val 0.11651, leaderboard = 0.11999 (val slightly better, leaderboard same as before I put random state 42 - changing random state doesn't have much impact)\n# v10 trial 3/10, 3508 n_est, val 0.11655, leaderboard = 0.11988\n# v19 trial 3/10, 3300 n_est, val 0.11657, leaderboard = 0.11993\n# v20 trial 3/10, 3800 n_est, val 0.11649, leaderboard = 0.11994 (m=1 for target encoding on this and prior models)\n# v21 trial 3/10, 3800 n_est, val 0.11644, leaderboard = 0.12030 (m=2 for target encoding)\n# v22 trial 3/10, 3800 n_est, val 0.11662, leaderboard = 0.12024 (m=0 for target encoding) - so looks like m=1 is best\n# v25 trial 3/10, 3508 n_est, val 0.11655, leaderboard = 0.11972 (m=1 for target encoding), random state fixed\n# v26 same as v25 except DF sorted by SaleCondition first val 0.11655, leaderboard=.44368\n# why v26 sort drastic  impact on leaderboard?
