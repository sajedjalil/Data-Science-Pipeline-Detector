There are five observations that an instructor may wish to remove from the data set before giving it to students (a plot of SALE PRICE versus GR LIV AREA will quickly indicate these points). Three of them are true outliers (Partial Sales that likely don’t represent actual market values) and two of them are simply unusual sales (very large houses priced relatively appropriately). I would recommend removing any houses with more than 4000 square feet from the data set (which eliminates these five unusual observations) before assigning it to students. \"*\n\n- First, let's plot the two features stated against one another, to identify the outliers.

This can mean multiple things:\n- A missing value may be the **result of an error during the production of the dataset**. This could be a human error, or machinery error depending on where the data comes from. \n- A missing value in some cases, may just mean a that a **'zero'** should be present.

Some are capable of handling them, but others are not. Therefore since we are using a variety of algorithms, it's best to treat them in an appropriate way.\n\n**If you have missing values, you have two options**:\n- Delete the entire row\n- Fill the missing entry with an imputed value\n\nIn order to treat this dataset, first of all I will create a dataset of the training and test data in order to make changes consistent across both.

What this means is that if we increase the predictor by 1 unit, the response always increases by X units. However, not all data has a linear relationship and therefore it may be necessary for your model to fit the more complex relationships in the data. \n\nBut how do you fit a model to data with complex relationships, unexplainable by a linear function? There are a variety of curve-fitting methods you can choose from to help you with this.\n\n- The most common way to fit curves to the data is to include polynomial terms, such as squared or cubed predictors.\n- Typically, you choose the model order by the number of bends you need in your line. Each increase in the exponent produces one more bend in the curved fitted line. It’s very rare to use more than a cubic term."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dda8ae8e-8af2-47fd-b06f-d30930877c8e","_uuid":"41f11814afbfa0956588d8bd162afaded2089eca","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(filename='../input/combinations/combinations.png')","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0e24f0cb-cb03-4661-956e-0df8aa45a2c8","_uuid":"d2e50bc73db64b20ebc08fbe484f4f2abb42920a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- If your response data follows a pattern that descends down to a lower bound, or ascends up to an upper bound, you can fit this type of relationship by including the reciprocal (1/x) of one or more predictor variables in the model.\n    - Generally, you want to use this form when the size of effect for a predictor variable decreases as its value increases. \n- Because the gradient is a function of 1/x, the gradient gets flatter as x increases. For this type of model, x can never equal 0 because you can’t divide by zero.\n\n*So... now that you're armed with this information, what's important to know is that in order to model non-linear, complex relationships between response and predictor variables, we can create combinations of these variables with increasing order, or reciprocal orders.*\n\n- Since we have such a high number of variables in the dataset, it's overkill to create polynomials of each feature.
