What if I tell you you can create your very first submission in less than 100 lines of code?\n\nNo,I'm not talking the usual Linear regression. I'm talking advanced Kaggle concepts like Feature engineering,Blending,Stackimg and Ensembling?\n\nWelcome Pycaret,a low Code library developed by Moez Ali,which helps professional data scientists develop prototypes quickly with very few lines of code.\n\nIt provides a great starting point to rule out what works for your data and what doesn't,so I highly recommend this. In this code, We will read the data and create models and final predictions. I do recommend reading the official documentation while following along,and typing your own code by reading this notebook.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#Pycaret needs to be installed\n!pip install pycaret --user\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv')\ntest  = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test.csv')\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-01T17:59:13.824283Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-01T17:59:13.825356Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-01T17:59:22.156236Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-01T17:59:13.825293Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-01T17:59:22.154718Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data fields\n\n*Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file.*\n\n* SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars.
