The idea of Boosting is to begin with a class of weak learners, and improving these weak learners into strong learners. It always starts off with a base learner; usually a tree-based model like Decision Tree. From there, the algorithm will train the Decision tree and identify mistakes that it has made. It then generates another decision tree, which place more emphasis in trying to correct these mistakes by giving more weights to the misclassified instance, while having less emphasis on the correct predictions. This process will go on until the algorithm no longer improves. Thus, we can see that Boosting builds models in a sequential manner where the current generation improves on the mistakes that the previous generation of models have made, learning and correcting these mistakes, ultimately improving from weak learner to a strong learner which can give accurate prediction.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*yDz8euzLbQvucBwx.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://imgur.com/E7faDVa)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='sec2.1'></a>\n### [2.1 Gradient Boost Regressor](#sec2.1)\nGradient Boost is a kind of tree-based boosting model that uses gradient descent as its optimization algorithm.
