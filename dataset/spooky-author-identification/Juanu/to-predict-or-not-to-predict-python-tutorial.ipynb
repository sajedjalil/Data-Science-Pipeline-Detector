In every one-liner code, you need to try to understand whats happening first in all of that. In our case, the first thing thats happening is that we are splitting our text by spaces :`text.split(\" \")`. This returns a list of words.\n2. We create a for loop (list comprehension), looping on each word and appying the stem using `stemmer.stem(word)`.\n3.
