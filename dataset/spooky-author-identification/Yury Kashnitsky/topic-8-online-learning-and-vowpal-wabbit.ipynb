Stochastic gradient descent and online learning\n##  1.1. Stochastic gradient descent\n\nDespite the fact that gradient descent is one of the first things learned in machine learning and optimization courses, it is hard to overrate one of it's modifications, namely, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n\nLets recap that the very idea of gradient descent is to minimize some function by making small steps in the direction of fastest function decreasing. The method was named due to the following fact from calculus: vector $\\nabla f = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\ldots \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n})^T$ of partial derivatives of the function $f(x) = f(x_1, \\ldots x_n)$ points to the direction of the fastest function growth. It means that by moving in the opposite direction (antigradient) it is possible to decrease the function value with the fastest rate.\n\n<img src='https://habrastorage.org/files/4f2/75d/a46/4f275da467a44fc4a8d1a11007776ed2.jpg' width=40%>\n\nHere is a snowboarder (me) in Sheregesh, Russian most popular winter resort. I highly recommended it if you like skiing or snowboarding. We place this picture not only for a good view but also for picturing the idea of gradient descent. If you have an aim to ride as fast as possible, you need to choose the way with steepest descent (as long as you stay alive). Calculating antigradient can be seen as evaluating the slope in each particular point."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7c41b31a7549e4dbcd0c31824d425d18ec6b9fbb","_cell_guid":"eda14ceb-ab19-4c75-a1ad-bbbbf3acb83d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Example**\n\nThe paired regression problem can be solved with gradient descent.

In other words, the algorithm requires a lot of iterations, at every iteration we have to recompute weights with formula which have a sum $\\sum_{i=1}^\\ell$ over the whole training set. What if we have billions of training samples?\n\n<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/ng/cs/owngcs-lzoguklv1pn9vz_r4ssm.jpeg\" />\n\nHere goes stochastic gradient descent! Simply, we throw away the summation sign and update the weights only over single training samples (or some dozen of them). Considering our case:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl} w_0^{(t+1)} = w_0^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i) \\\\  w_1^{(t+1)} = w_1^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i)x_i \\end{array}$$\n\nWith this approach there is no guarantee that we will move in best possible direction at every iteration and we might need many more iterations, but we get virtually instant weight updates."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7d61f90cd77f5fc64646a22cdcaaa3e9ee012ebc","_cell_guid":"dc9f67f3-4110-40b6-b7bd-a2736233d10f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Andrew Ng has a good illustration in his machine learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), lets take a look at it.\n\n<img src='https://habrastorage.org/files/f8d/90c/f83/f8d90cf83b044255bb07df3373f25fc7.png'>\n\nHere are contour plots of some function and we are looking for the global minimum of this function.
