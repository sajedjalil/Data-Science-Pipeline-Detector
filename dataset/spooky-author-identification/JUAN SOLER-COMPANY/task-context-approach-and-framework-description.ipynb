Introduction to the task</h1>\n\nFirst of all, lets talk about the classic NLP document classification task. This is a classic task in the field of NLP in which the goal is to classify texts with respect to a predefined set of candidate categories. Each one of these categories will be referred as classes or labels from now on.  \nSome examples of document classification tasks:\n* Given a web page and a query (google search query for example), determine if a document is relevant.\n* Given a text, determine if the content is considered positive or negative.\n* Given a word, determine which one of its senses is being used.\n* Given a set of assignments, determine if there has been cases of plagarism.\n* Given a text, determine if it contains hate speech or not.\n...\nSo, yeah, there are maaaaany examples and each one of them is a whole area of study in the NLP community.\n\nLet us use this task as an example. We have a corpus of texts written by 3 different authors. The goal is to determine who wrote unseen texts between the three candidates.  \n\n**How do we do that? \n**\n\nWe could manually code some rules to classify them (e.g., if \"Cthulhu\" appears, them H.P. Lovecraft is the answer). This sort of rule-based approach is usually not scalable: if an unexpected case appears, new rules need to be implemented. \nA popular alternative is to use machine learning. The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience. Machine learning algorithms learn from the provided data and extract underlying regular patterns from it. The extracted patterns can then be applied to the classification of unseen data instances. This is the approach that I'm going to be using.\n\nThe typical machine learning-driven text classification approach works like this:\n1) we determine which features of the text are distinctive (i.e., can help distinguishing between text classes).\n2) we extract said features.       \n3) we use the feature vectors along with the correct classes of the training set to learn (i'm assuming there exists a set of texts in which \"the correct answer\" is known, usually known as training set), feeding them to a standard supervised machine learning algorithm (such as SVM, Random Forests, etc.)\n4) we use the model that is extracted by the machine learning algorithm to classify unseen instances. \n5) if we have the correct classes of the unseen instances, we evaluate how well we did.\n\nAll right, still with me folks? So, given the presented steps, which one do you think is the critical step? \n\nThere are plenty of machine learning algorithms that can be easily used off-the-shelf and that work very well, extracting features is just a matter of coding, the evaluation usually consists in applying a formula that considers the output of the classifier. The choice of feature sets is the key component in this type of approach. This feature selection process  is often called \"feature engineering\".\n\n<h1>2 Feature Engineering </h1>\nFeature engineering is a vaguely defined set of tasks related to designing feature sets for machine learning applications (which in some cases, is considered an art). The first important task to do, in order to correctly design a feature set is to understand the properties of the problem at hand and assess how they might interact with the chosen classifier. After understanding the problem, hypotheses need to be drawn. Feature engineering is thus a cycle, in which a set of features is proposed, experiments with this feature set are performed, and, after analyzing the results, the feature set is modified to improve the performance until the results are satisfactory. \n\nAlthough it is often possible to obtain competitive performance using fairly simple and obvious sets of features, there is room for significant performance improvement. Carefully constructed feature sets require thorough understanding of the task at hand, but can significantly outperform basic feature sets. In short, better features mean better results.\n\nThe data needs to be characterized by a group of features that differentiate between the instances that belong to a class with respect to the other classes. Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact the performance of the classifier. An example of an irrelevant feature would be one that takes a fixed value for any instance in the input data.\n\nOptimal feature selection helps the algorithms extract patterns that generalize to unseen instances without needing complex parametrization of the classifier to perform competitively, preventing overfitting. Models created by the machine learning algorithm which contain the  \"knowledge\" extracted from training data are faster to run, easier to understand and to maintain if the feature set is appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"506521e523eaf55f2214d1c97d1a37db6c2174fc","_cell_guid":"4a62b0bc-3f4a-43c9-9f4f-a6a4db450590"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"After talking about the general task of text classification, let us talk about the specific task at hand.\n\n<h1>3. Author Identification</h1>\n\nThe task at hand can be considered an author identification problem. The goal is to determine the author of a text with a predefined set of authors.\n\nSo, the question is,  are we the first ones that thought about that? \n\nThe answer is...\n\nYeah, no.\n\nGiven how wrong you are if you thought the answer was YES! Let me give you a....\n\n<div style=\"color:red;background:black;\">**HISTORY LESSON!**</div>\n\n(real shame the marquee tag didnt work)\n\nOne of the first proposals that implemented a data-driven author identification system is:\n\nFrederick Mosteller and David L. Wallace, ‘Inference in an authorship problem’,Journal of the Ameri-can Statistical Association,58(302), 275–309, (1963). \n\nYeah, 1963! (some of us were not even planned yet)\n\nThe authors tried to clarify the authorship of the Federalist Papers drawing upon function words and Naive Bayes classification.  The Federalist Papers is a collection of 85 articles and essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution.  The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays is fairly certain. The remaining 12  are the subjects of study of several scholars.\n\nThe other classic problem involves this guy:\n![](https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_300%2Cq_80%2Cw_300/MTE1ODA0OTcxNzgzMzkwNzMz/william-shakespeare-194895-1-402.jpg)\n\nHe looks like he is hiding something.\n\nLong story short, people believe that William Shakespeare did not actually write some of his best plays. His biography, humble origins, obscure life (not much is known of his personal life) made people question how, given his background, could he be the greatest writer of all time.  So, many researchers used NLP to research on the topic. None of the results are absolutely conclusive, but it seems that some of his works are stylistically related to other authors. If you want to read more about the topic, refer to:\n\n* Hierarchical and Non-Hierarchical Linear and Non-Linear Clustering Methods to \"Shakespeare Authorship Question\" by Refat Aljumly \n\nand \n\n* Neural computation in stylometry I: An application to the works of Shakespeare and Fletcher by Robert Matthews and Thomas Merriam.\n\nAnother very interesting authorship problem that was in the news a couple of years ago is the case of Robert Galbraith. In 2013 a novel  called The Cuckoo’s Calling was published by an unknown author called Robert Galbraith. A newspaper received an anonymous tip that this author was actually J.K Rowling, which wanted to publish a crime novel without the influence of the whole \"Harry Potter\" universe to affect its success. Said newspaper wanted to prove it and hired a researcher in the field of author identification. The researcher observed many similarities between the styles of J.K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith.  J.K Rowling admitted it was her all along (bummed out probably to be outed by us nerds).\n\n<div style=\"color:red;background:black;\">**END OF HISTORY LESSON!**</div>\n\nSo yeah, these are some of the mainstream cases. But there are MANY other previous works on the task. Author identification  is often applied in forensic linguistic scenarios (here you can see the kind of linguistic analysis that can be done in police investigation: [https://www2.fbi.gov/publications/leb/1996/oct964.txt](http://))\n\nHow do some of these approaches tackle this task? What features do they use? Let me present some examples:\n* Character/token n-grams (frequencies of sequences of characters/words)\n* Frequency of specific words (the most relevant, look up function words, tf-idf computation and all of that good stuff)\n* Usage of specific parts of speech (frequencies of adjectives, nouns, etc).\n* Punctuation mark usage (very stylistic in some languages).\n* Syntactic structural features (analysis on the syntactic trees of the sentences).\n* Topic models\n* Word embeddings\n...\n\nand a large ETC.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"f0ad716766796bb68b8d27fafb164a2a9b93243e","_cell_guid":"5d8f1f22-e6e2-4929-b550-9eafadf15d8a"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"<h1>4. Approach description</h1>\n\nAt this point you might be thinking: \"WTF IS THIS, I WANT TO SEE CODE\" or \"WOW, THIS IS MARVELOUS\". I am specially eloquent, basically because I presented my PhD on author identification and profiling (instead of identifying the author of texts, try to identify demographic traits of the author: gender, age, etc.) a couple of months ago. \n\nSo now that I have put everything in a bit of context, let me introduce my approach and then I'll explain the Python framework I created (during the development of my PhD thesis) and show you some of the things it can do. \n\nAn overview of the flow of the system is shown in the following image:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ljqGT9Y.png)\n\nSo, it seems like a standard text classification machine learning flow. The only peculiar thing is that I use both syntactic parsing and some dictionaries. \n\nThe important part of the system is the selected feature set. \n\nThe feature set is composed of six subgroups of features:\n\n**Character-based features\n**\n\nare composed of the ratios between upper case characters, periods, commas, parentheses, exclamations, colons,\nnumber digits, semicolons, hyphens and quotation marks and the total number of characters in a text.\n\n**Word-based features **\n\nare composed of the mean number of characters per word, vocabulary richness, acronyms, stopwords, first person pronouns, usage of words composed by two or three characters, standard deviation of word length and the difference between the longest and shortest words.\n\n**Sentence-based features**\n\nare composed of the mean number of words per sentence, standard deviation of words per sentence and the difference between the maximum and minimum number of words per sentence in a text.\n\n**Dictionary-based features**\n\nconsist of the ratios of discourse markers, interjections, abbreviations, curse words, and polar words (positive and negative words in polarity dictionaries) with respect to the total number of words in a text.\n\n**Syntactic features**\n\nThree types of syntactic features are distinguished:\n\nPart-of-Speech features are given by  the relative frequency of each PoS tag. We use the Penn Treebank tagset  ([http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html](http://)) in a text,  the relative frequency of comparative/superlative adjectives and adverbs and the relative frequency of the present and past tenses. In addition to the fine-grained Penn Treebank tags, we introduce general grammatical categories (such as \"verb\", \"noun\", etc.) and calculate their frequencies.\n\nDependency features reflect the occurrence of syntactic dependency relations in the dependency trees of the text. The tagset used by the parser is the standard penn treebank dependency tagset. We extract the frequency of each individual dependency relation per sentence, the percentage of modifier relations used per tree,  the frequency of adverbial dependencies (they give information on manner, direction, purpose, etc.), the ratio of modal verbs with respect to the total number of verbs, and the percentage of verbs that appear in complex tenses referred to as \"verb chains\" (VCs).\n\nTree features measure the tree width, the tree depth and the ramification factor. Tree depth is defined as the maximum number of nodes between the root and a leaf node; the width is the maximum number of siblings at any of the levels of the tree; and the ramification factor is the mean number of children per level. In other words, the tree  features characterize the complexity of the dependency structure of the sentences. \n\nThese measures are also applied to subordinate and coordinate clauses.\n\n(I usually use discourse features as well, but I'm going to pass in this case)\n\n**Lexical features**\n\nSuper simple, just the frequency of the N most frequent words in the training set.\n\nThe full set is composed of less than 200 features and in several tasks, it performs at state-of-the-art level.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"48a41234d7240ba2da3d3b818bb23f4b1aee730c","_cell_guid":"942d093f-1763-49fe-b5f5-5db69200f63f"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"<h1>5.
