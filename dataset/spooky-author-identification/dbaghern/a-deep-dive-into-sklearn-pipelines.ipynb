To get to the next level, pipelines are your friend!\n\nPipelines are a way to streamline a lot of the routine processes, encapsulating little pieces of logic into one function call, which makes it easier to actually do modeling instead just writing a bunch of code. Pipelines allow for experiments, and for a dataset like this that only has the text as a feature, you're going to need to do a lot of experiments. Plus, when your modeling gets really complicated, it's sometimes hard to see if you have any data leakage hiding somewhere. Pipelines are set up with the fit/transform/predict functionality, so you can fit a whole pipeline to the training data and transform to the test data, without having to do it individually for each thing you do. Super convenienent, right??\n\nThis notebook is going to break down the pipeline process to make it easier to see how they all fit together.
