One could advice to find more data.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d3d2f065-6baf-4ac1-9d08-ce51e5c1ae18","_uuid":"3391b9e1a039cf85330ab73935944ab6d105aab6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/the-data-says-we-need-more-data-d39d3.png)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"177b7ca2-5da1-4ddb-9d78-8b630fd98198","_uuid":"aeba2acdccfb832fbfb8f19ddee2cfb983da298f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"However, we decided to experiment with transfer learning instead, and check if it will work here. \n\nThis notebook describes next steps:\n1.
