My main goal is to show you how you could approach a problem in general and how to do hyperparameter training.\n\nIn every data science task, I see four main steps in the process of solving a problem. These will by the way also be my main chapters:\n1. <a href=\"#feature_inspection\">Feature inspection</a>\n2. <a href=\"#feature_creation\">Feature creation</a>\n3. <a href=\"#model_training\">Model training</a>\n4. <a href=\"#model_selection\">Model selection</a>\n\nPersonally, I think you should spend most time in chapters 1 and 2, since I believe your model is as good as the data you input.\n\nIn section 1 we will inspect some basic statistics of the dataset.<br/>\nIn section 2 the preprocessing of the data and the LDA and Word2Vec model will be explained and applied.<br/>\nIn section 3 we will see how a grid search can be applied for hyperparameter training.<br/>\nIn section 4 we will select the model and make a submission.\n\nIf you read this kernel and are eager to give me some feedback, in particular I'm interested in performance improvements and writing neat code. But of course, any feedback is welcome. So please let me know when you have remarks! :)\n\nFirst of all, let's import the data and specify all imports we will use in this kernel."},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"90257367b76fbce050d27d402b75ca39769a852b","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"1bcbec45-6245-4d47-802e-7307ee8bf386"},"source":"# more common imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\n# languange processing imports\nimport nltk\nfrom gensim.corpora import Dictionary\n# preprocessing imports\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# model imports\nfrom gensim.models.ldamulticore import LdaMulticore\nfrom gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n# hyperparameter training imports\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\n# visualization imports\nfrom IPython.display import display\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport base64\nimport io\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set()  # defines the style of the plots to be seaborn style","outputs":[]},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"e2874ece22b56df0604441e3e366fe75f098d1d9","_cell_guid":"5466f6bf-c220-485f-9b6b-a647e71a7d4c"},"source":"train_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\n\nprint(train_data.shape)\ntrain_data.head(3)","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8c457e83b8fc5eb322dba39816d5ed1d54b6c918","_cell_guid":"65df12cf-1a3e-414e-9560-11256e5f9393"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1) Feature Inspection <a id=\"feature_inspection\"></a>\n\nIn order to get some feeling for the data we are going to work with, we will start out with a quick exploratory phase.

We have to make sure our model can understand similarities and understand when two different words mean similar things. You can't just input the raw text into a model and expect it to understand everything. Therefor, I summarized the most common steps to take in order to achieve this cleansing.\n\n1. Tokenize the text; split sentences in (good) words. Thus watch out for punctuation.\n2. Remove words that mean little; these are usually words that occur very frequently or words that occur very infrequently. Also, punctuation can be removed, but perhaps you'd like to keep some punctuation in, like exclamation marks or question marks since maybe one writer uses them more than others.\n3. Stemming; this basically means joining words that mean the same. Take for example the words running and runs, the stem of both words is run. Thus with stemming you'd group these words together and give them the same meaning for the model.\n4. Vectorize words; since we can't input plain words into a model and expect it to learn from it, we have to vectorize the words. This basically means create unit vectors for all words.\n\nFor LDA you'd like to perform all four steps. However, for w2v you'd only want to tokenize and remove some punctuation. The w2v model can determine by itself what words are important and what are not, but we'll get back to that later on.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6ac9f496620068f305f24e4495962aee442fcf72","_cell_guid":"925610a0-ee82-4550-859a-aa6e470fdb6b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1) Tokenize the text\n\nI noticed there's some non-ascii characters present. I want to simply filter them out. For LDA I want to completely remove these words since it's highly likely the words with invalid characters appear only once and therefor don't have much value for the topics anyway. For word2vec I want to keep the order and the number of words per sentence the same; therefor I will replace these words with a random word 'qwerty'. Why the number of words and the order is important, will be clear later on when we discuss the model.

It is a three level hierarchical Bayesian model where it creates probabilities on word level, on document level and on corpus level (corpus means all documents). The objective function looks pretty complex, but it's just a way of describing the probability of a corpus:\n\n$$p(\\mathcal{D} | \\alpha, \\eta) = \\prod_{m=1}^{M} \\int p(\\theta_{m} | \\alpha) \\prod_{n=1}^{N_{m}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p(z_{mn}^{i} | \\theta_{m}) p(w_{mn} | z_{mn}^{i}, \\eta) d\\theta_{m}$$\n\nwhere $w_{mn}$ represents word $n$ from document $m$. The three level hierarchical Bayesian model can now be summarized as follows. First of all, parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\eta$ are corpus level parameters. Second, variables $\\theta_{1},...,\\theta_{M}$ are document level parameters. Third, all the $z_{mn}^{i}$ and $w_{mn}$ are word level variables. So we have $M$ documents, we have $k$ topics and we have $N_{m}$ words per document.\n\nThis is the objective function that we want to optimize with LDA; we want to maximize the probability of the corpus in the training set.\n\nThere's one more thing I'd like to point out, before we start training the model. We have to pick two priors: Dir($\\alpha$) for the topic distribution and a Multinomial($\\theta$) for the words (given a topic). Usually both priors are uniformly distributed, however, it is only natural to assume that some topics occur more often than others, therefor we will give $\\alpha$ an asymmetric prior. We could do the same for $\\theta$ for the word distributions, but that wouldn't make sense anymore for the following reason. We don't know what words in what topics appear with greater probabilities. For that reason, we keep the uniform distribution the prior distribution and let the model learn by itself what words in what topics appear with greater probabilities.\n\n## LDA training\n"},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"7b870c0ae312755a826a04bb46e1a988c9a956d9","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"a57bcbd2-a92a-4188-aa95-23c9e03f1de7"},"source":"corpus = train_data.bow","outputs":[]},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"624da051038c570a4461417dc8b51a52d156a7d5","_cell_guid":"c783b56e-36fe-41f1-8698-4f4b3d146bc8"},"source":"%%time\nnum_topics = 150\n#A multicore approach to decrease training time\nLDAmodel = LdaMulticore(corpus=corpus,\n                        id2word=dictionary,\n                        num_topics=num_topics,\n                        workers=4,\n                        chunksize=4000,\n                        passes=7,\n                        alpha='asymmetric')","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"26413615385c7f07671f26820c41cc6f91fa13b8","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"0c93ba36-dc3f-4f68-aeb0-93725bb6a4b5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## LDA topic inspection\n\nLet's first create the feature vectors."},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"9e8d1cfeecb59fdd5258106b980297713136d516","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"7fb38e49-f9bf-43a4-959f-b22cc2be23d2"},"source":"def document_to_lda_features(lda_model, document):\n    \"\"\" Transforms a bag of words document to features.\n    It returns the proportion of how much each topic was\n    present in the document.\n    \"\"\"\n    topic_importances = LDAmodel.get_document_topics(document, minimum_probability=0)\n    topic_importances = np.array(topic_importances)\n    return topic_importances[:,1]\n\ntrain_data['lda_features'] = list(map(lambda doc:\n                                      document_to_lda_features(LDAmodel, doc),\n                                      train_data.bow))","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f756d605dc2922a4eb896aaad0a910b0a00eeee8","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"fa7a2419-5946-4d09-9e9f-8bac050ab4fa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's continue with the author individual topic distributions and let's see some words that come with the topics."},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"968a75b591af5a6b141305a427c71e85d158641f","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"380176ad-9db9-4d2c-b03a-dc9179610e41"},"source":"EAP_topic_distribution = train_data.loc[train_data.author == 'EAP', 'lda_features'].mean()\nHPL_topic_distribution = train_data.loc[train_data.author == 'HPL', 'lda_features'].mean()\nMWS_topic_distribution = train_data.loc[train_data.author == 'MWS', 'lda_features'].mean()","outputs":[]},{"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"81c951f3cba6499088c812e695105e3f519e73d5","_cell_guid":"950a4399-b43e-4414-96f3-5c4588902c30"},"source":"fig, [ax1,ax2,ax3] = plt.subplots(3,1,figsize=(20,10))\n\nnr_top_bars = 5\n\nax1.set_title(\"EAP topic distributions\", fontsize=16)\nax2.set_title(\"HPL topic distributions\", fontsize=16)\nax3.set_title(\"MWS topic distributions\", fontsize=16)\nax3.text(-10, 0.04, \"Average Probability of Topic\", fontsize=30, ha=\"center\", va=\"center\",\n         rotation=\"vertical\")\n\nfor ax, distribution, color in zip([ax1,ax2,ax3],\n                                   [EAP_topic_distribution,HPL_topic_distribution,MWS_topic_distribution],\n                                   ['b','g','r']):\n    #
