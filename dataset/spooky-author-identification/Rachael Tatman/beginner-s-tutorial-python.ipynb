That's just a fancy way of saying that we're going to count how often each author uses every word in our training data and then divide by the number of total words they wrote. Then, if our test sentence has words that we've seen one author use a lot more than the others, we will guess that that person is probably the author.\n\nLet's imagine that this is our training corpus:\n\n* Author one: \"A very spooky thing happened. The thing was so spooky I screamed.\"\n* Author two: \"I ate a tasty candy apple. It was delicious\"\n\nAnd that this is our test sentence that we want to figure out who wrote:\n\n* Author ???: \"What a spooky thing!\"\n\nJust looking at it, it seems more likely that author one wrote this sentence. Author ones says both \"spooky\" and \"thing\" a lot, while author two does not (at least, based on our training data). Since we see both \"spooky\" and \"thing\" in our test sentence, it seems more likely that it was written by author one than author two--even though the test sentence does have the word \"a\" in it, which we have seen author two use too.\n\nIn the rest of this tutorial we're going to figure out how to translate this intution into code."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"52783943-8073-4d7d-815d-868500ecf850","_uuid":"12b7cdc56b317df2ef4392c3b304a51ceda10caf"},"source":"## Read in some helpful NLP libraries & our dataset\n\nFor this tutorial, I'm going to be using the Natural Language Toolkit, also called the \"NLTK\".
