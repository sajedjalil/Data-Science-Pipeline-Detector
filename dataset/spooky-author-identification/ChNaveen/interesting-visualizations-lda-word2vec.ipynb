In other words, a document is represented as a vector of token counts. There are two layers in this model — documents and tokens — and the size or dimensionality of the document vectors is the number of tokens in the corpus vocabulary. This approach has a number of disadvantages:\n\n* Document vectors tend to be large (one dimension for each token ⇒⇒ lots of dimensions)\n* They also tend to be very sparse. Any given document only contains a small fraction of all tokens in the vocabulary, so most values in the document's token vector are 0.\n* The dimensions are fully indepedent from each other — there's no sense of connection between related tokens, such as knife and fork.\n\nLDA injects a third layer into this conceptual model. Documents are represented as a mixture of a pre-defined number of topics, and the topics are represented as a mixture of the individual tokens in the vocabulary. The number of topics is a model hyperparameter selected by the practitioner. LDA makes a prior assumption that the (document, topic) and (topic, token) mixtures follow Dirichlet probability distributions. This assumption encourages documents to consist mostly of a handful of topics, and topics to consist mostly of a modest set of the tokens.\n\nLDA is fully unsupervised. The topics are \"discovered\" automatically from the data by trying to maximize the likelihood of observing the documents in your corpus, given the modeling assumptions. They are expected to capture some latent structure and organization within the documents, and often have a meaningful human interpretation for people familiar with the subject material.\n\nWe'll again turn to gensim to assist with data preparation and modeling.

The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter λλ, which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.\n\nSetting the λλ parameter close to 1.0 (the default) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.\n\nSetting λλ close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their \"distinctiveness\" or \"exclusivity\" within the topic — i.e., terms that occur only in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.\n\nSetting λλ to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly.\n\nRolling the mouse over a term in the bar chart on the right will cause the topic circles to resize in the plot on the left, to show the strength of the relationship between the topics and the selected term.\n\nA more detailed explanation of the pyLDAvis visualization can be found here. Unfortunately, though the data used by gensim and pyLDAvis are the same, they don't use the same ID numbers for topics. If you need to match up topics in gensim's LdaMulticore object and pyLDAvis' visualization, you have to dig through the terms manually.\n\n### Analyzing our LDA model\nThe interactive visualization pyLDAvis produces is helpful for both:\n\nBetter understanding and interpreting individual topics, and Better understanding the relationships between the topics.\n\nFor (1), you can manually select each topic to view its top most freqeuent and/or \"relevant\" terms, using different values of the λλ parameter. This can help when you're trying to assign a human interpretable name or \"meaning\" to each topic.\n\nFor (2), exploring the Intertopic Distance Plot can help you learn about how topics relate to each other, including potential higher-level structure between groups of topics.\n\n### Describing text with LDA\nBeyond data exploration, one of the key uses for an LDA model is providing a compact, quantitative description of natural language text. Once an LDA model has been trained, it can be used to represent free text as a mixture of the topics the model learned from the original corpus. This mixture can be interpreted as a probability distribution across the topics, so the LDA representation of a paragraph of text might look like 50% Topic A, 20% Topic B, 20% Topic C, and 10% Topic D.\n\nTo use an LDA model to generate a vector representation of new text, you'll need to apply any text preprocessing steps you used on the model's training corpus to the new text, too. For our model, the preprocessing steps we used include:\n\n* Using spaCy to remove punctuation and lemmatize the text\n* Applying our first-order phrase model to join word pairs\n* Applying our second-order phrase model to join longer phrases\n* Removing stopwords\n* Creating a bag-of-words representation\n\nOnce you've applied these preprocessing steps to the new text, it's ready to pass directly to the model to create an LDA representation. The lda_description(...) function will perform all these steps for us, including printing the resulting topical description of the input text."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"131ec21b-cabc-44e0-b89a-5f1155e08f86","_uuid":"0f386ba3e3b6ce3c2d2f0d9757834ebe687c310b","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"topic_names={0: 'EAP',\n             1: 'MWS',\n             2: 'HPL'}\ndef lda_description(text, min_topic_freq=0.08):\n    \"\"\"\n    accept the original text of a review and (1) parse it with spaCy,\n    (2) apply text pre-proccessing steps, (3) create a bag-of-words\n    representation, (4) create an LDA representation, and\n    (5) print a sorted list of the top topics in the LDA representation\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # parse the review text with spaCy\n    parsed_sent = nlp(text)\n    \n    # lemmatize the text and remove punctuation and whitespace\n    unigram_sent = [token.lemma_ for token in parsed_sent\n                      if not punct_space(token)]\n    \n    # apply the first-order models\n    bigram_sent = bigram_model[unigram_sent]\n    \n    # remove any remaining stopwords\n    bigram_sent = [term for term in bigram_sent\n                      if not term in spacy.en.English.Defaults.stop_words]\n    \n    # create a bag-of-words representation\n    sent_bow = bigram_dictionary.doc2bow(bigram_sent)\n    \n    # create an LDA representation\n    sent_lda = lda[sent_bow]\n    \n    # sort with the most highly related topics first\n    sent_lda = sorted(sent_lda, key=lambda x: -x[1])\n    \n    for topic_number, freq in sent_lda:\n        if freq < min_topic_freq:\n            break\n            \n        # print the most highly related topic names and frequencies\n        print('{:25} {}'.format(topic_names[topic_number],\n                                round(freq, 3)))","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"02677451-d9cc-453a-bcd7-d64f0596aa48","_uuid":"1586ca2abd484dc5acfa28bc9e9589e6e2352e7d"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"print('Probabilities:')\nprint(lda_description(train.loc[5, 'text']))\nprint('Actual:', train.loc[5, 'author'])","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6595cabc-5cb4-4126-b7b5-56eecc509303","_uuid":"c27865077e434df5c7194b22c0a4f9801c1952d1"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"print('Probabilities:')\nprint(lda_description(train.loc[1000, 'text']))\nprint('Actual:', train.loc[1000, 'author'])","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"43a6fddb-10cb-4c89-a77b-21480f22d159","_uuid":"422f11283f12f103c82351f489d154c34e53a6ea"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Model is trying to predict the topic probabilities as you can see above.

I have just mapped the names to show how its used and can be interpreted.\n\n## Word Vector Embedding with Word2Vec\nThe goal of word vector embedding models, or word vector models for short, is to learn dense, numerical vector representations for each term in a corpus vocabulary. If the model is successful, the vectors it learns about each term should encode some information about the meaning or concept the term represents, and the relationship between it and other terms in the vocabulary. Word vector models are also fully unsupervised — they learn all of these meanings and relationships solely by analyzing the text of the corpus, without any advance knowledge provided.\n\nPerhaps the best-known word vector model is word2vec, originally proposed in 2013. The general idea of word2vec is, for a given focus word, to use the context of the word — i.e., the other words immediately before and after it — to provide hints about what the focus word might mean. To do this, word2vec uses a sliding window technique, where it considers snippets of text only a few tokens long at a time.\n\nAt the start of the learning process, the model initializes random vectors for all terms in the corpus vocabulary. The model then slides the window across every snippet of text in the corpus, with each word taking turns as the focus word. Each time the model considers a new snippet, it tries to learn some information about the focus word based on the surrouding context, and it \"nudges\" the words' vector representations accordingly. One complete pass sliding the window across all of the corpus text is known as a training epoch. It's common to train a word2vec model for multiple passes/epochs over the corpus. Over time, the model rearranges the terms' vector representations such that terms that frequently appear in similar contexts have vector representations that are close to each other in vector space.\n\nFor a deeper dive into word2vec's machine learning process, see here.\n\nWord2vec has a number of user-defined hyperparameters, including:\n\n* The dimensionality of the vectors. Typical choices include a few dozen to several hundred.\n* The width of the sliding window, in tokens. Five is a common default choice, but narrower and wider windows are possible.\n* The number of training epochs.\n\nFor using word2vec in Python, gensim comes to the rescue again! It offers a highly-optimized, parallelized implementation of the word2vec algorithm with its Word2Vec class."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"train['vec_inp'] = train['bigram_text'].map(lambda x: x.split(' '))","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"import sys\n\nword2vec = Word2Vec(train['vec_inp'], size=20, window=5,\n                        min_count=5, sg=0)\n\n# perform another 100 epochs of training\nfor i in range(1,200):\n    sys.stderr.write('\\rOn {}'.format(i))\n    word2vec.train(train['vec_inp'], total_examples=word2vec.corpus_count, \n                   epochs=word2vec.iter)","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"print(u'{:,} terms in the word2vec vocabulary.'.format(len(word2vec.wv.vocab)))","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"# build a list of the terms, integer indices,\n# and term counts from the food2vec model vocabulary\nordered_vocab = [(term, voc.index, voc.count)\n                 for term, voc in word2vec.wv.vocab.items()]\n\n# sort by the term counts, so the most common terms appear first\nordered_vocab = sorted(ordered_vocab, key=lambda x: -x[2])\n\n# unzip the terms, integer indices, and counts into separate lists\nordered_terms, term_indices, term_counts = zip(*ordered_vocab)\n# create a DataFrame with the word2vec vectors as data,\n# and the terms as row labels\nword_vectors = pd.DataFrame(word2vec.wv.syn0[:],\n                            index=ordered_terms)\n\nword_vectors","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"def get_related_terms(token, topn=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    look up the topn most similar terms to token\n    and print them as a formatted list\n    \"\"\"\n\n    for word, similarity in word2vec.most_similar(positive=[token], topn=topn):\n\n        print(u'{:20} {}'.format(word, round(similarity, 3)))","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"get_related_terms(u'owl')","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"get_related_terms(u'fear')","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"get_related_terms(u'blood')","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"get_related_terms(u'jealous')","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Word algebra!\nThe core idea is that once words are represented as numerical vectors, you can do math with them.
