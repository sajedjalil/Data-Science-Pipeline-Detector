The real challenge for this exercise isn't necessarily the model selection and parameter (although this is a key decision), but more about the features that build the model.

I used nltk for this as well. The nltk module pos_tag creates a list of tuples which contain a POS and the token from the tokens without punc list. I then used the Counter() class from collections to generate a list of dicts where the key is the POS and the value is the count of that POS in the list of tokens. From these dicts, I joined them into a single df with each unique POS acting as the index and each column representing the counts for each POS by record in the training data. This allows me to easily transpose the df and join it by the index to the rest of the training date, making each POS count a new feature. We probably do not want to use all of these features in our model, so I droped the POS where the sum of the counts was less than the median sum of the counts.
