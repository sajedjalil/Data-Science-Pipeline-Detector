Based on how good or bad the fit is, try to improve our idea of what \"skills\" are, e.g. by splitting a single skill into two separate one.\n\nThe paper I linked above gives a specific example of a skill that works better when split into two sub-skills:\n\nThe data came from beginners learning how to program. One expert-defined skill was \"making a function with one or more parameters\". The Learning Factors Analysis found that this skill should be split into \"make a function with one parameter\" and \"making a function with more than one parameters\".
