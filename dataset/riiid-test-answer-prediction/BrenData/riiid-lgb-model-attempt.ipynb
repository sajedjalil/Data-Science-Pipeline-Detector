{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Opening Notes \n\nThis competition was really fun for me and I learned so much as the competition progressed. Here are a few of the things I have learnt along the way.\n\n- Manipulating/transforming/loading large datasets with compute limits \n- Advanced data manipulation and analysis using pandas (Pandas is now my top tag on Stack Overflow!)\n- Learnt how to use an Automized hyperparameter tuner called Optuna\n- Feature engineering with tabular time series data\n- and so much more!\n\n### Data Sources\nI used 4 different data sources to load into this one notebook, and they are as follows.\n\n1. riid-test-answer-prediction\n\nThis was the actual competition data which contained csv file with 100 million rows of users and their interactions with quesitons. There was also metadata referring to each question_id and lecture_id, and example_test data, and a sample submission. I will go into more detail regarding the features provided throughout the notebook.\n\n\n2. riiid-splitting-train-and-test-data\n\nI created a seperate notebook to split the notebook into two seperate datasets because I was unable to stay within CPU and RAM notebook limits. I also wanted to save the dataset to pickle as otherwise it took forever to load in. This enabled me to use a portion of the data to get specific user features and statistics on each question type. I go into into more detail in that notebook about the split and encourage you to check it out. \n\n3. riiid-content-answers-df-preperation\n\nThis is essentially a csv file of question statistics that I put together, and I looped through this and updated the question accuracy as I preprocessed the training dataset. I could not do this in this notebook as training the LGB model would just force the Notebook to go over the CPU limits.\n\n4. riid-train-df\n\nPickled 100 million rows so I could load in all the data. I had to do this as some of the dictionaries necessary to create features were to large to keep when training the model. I found a good solution to this was to load in all the data at the end of the notebook after deleting it all to get those dictionaries back before making predictions on the test dataset.\n\n### Helpful Notebooks\n\nTito's Looping Strategy - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/lgbm-with-loop-feature-engineering)\n\nVopani's Notebook on Large Datasets -  [link](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/tutorial-on-reading-large-datasets)\n\nAlex Bader's Notebook on Quesion Tags - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/spacelx/2020-r3id-clustering-question-tags)\n\nMark wijkhuizen's Feature Eng - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/markwijkhuizen/riiid-training-and-prediction-using-a-state)\n\nTakamotoki's Data Manipulation Techniques [link](https://www.kaggle.com/takamotoki/lgbm-iii-part3-adding-lecture-features)\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Imports and Loading Data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#basic\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport gc\n\n#Model imports\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n\n#optuna\nimport optuna\nfrom optuna.samplers import TPESampler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\n# You can only call make_env() once, so don't lose it!\nimport riiideducation\n\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Specifying the datatypes of the dataset that I was loading in really helped keep the size of the files down.

It basically groups the tags into five groups. Some of the tags were \"connected\" by a specific tag number, others were by themselves, and others were in pairs. He did this using a framework called networkx which provided great visualizations of these connections. I encourage you to check out his analysis linked at the top of this notebook.\n\n**num_in_bundle**\n\nThis feature came about when I realized that we dont see some of the questions in the entire training dataset. I realized that three consecutive questions werent seen, and it occured to me that some questions are connected and always answered together. I created a feature that says how many parts to the question there is.\n\n**avg_q_time**\n\nThis feature was brought in from the content_answers_df and was basically the total average amount of time spent on each question. I was able to get this variable by shifting the prior_question_elapsed_time variable and taking the average of all the times. I ran into some difficulty here as there were a number of numpy inf and pandas NaN values which could not be dropped easily.\n\n**lag_time**\n\nI probably could have added created this feature in this notebook, but it did take a while to loop through and add this feature. I mentioned a little bit about this variable above, but it is essentially the time between the current interaction and the previous interaction of the specific user. This was one of the last features I came across and bumped up my score by a decent margin.\n\n\nNOTE: It is also a great help to list the column names of all the features, and the column that you will be predicting as it makes the pipeline more readable and easy to debug.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"features = [\n    'user_mean_accuracy', \n    'user_questions_answered',\n    'user_questions_correct',\n    'q_mean_accuracy', \n    'q_question_asked',\n    'q_question_correct',\n    'community',\n    'num_in_bundle',\n    'tags_mean_accuracy', \n    'tags_question_asked', \n    'tags_std_accuracy', \n    'tags_skew_accuracy',\n    'part_mean_accuracy', \n    'part_questions_answered', \n    'prior_question_elapsed_time', \n    #'prior_question_had_explanation',\n    'part_1',\n    'part_2',\n    'part_3',\n    'part_4',\n    'part_5',\n    'part_6',\n    'part_7',\n    'type_of_concept',\n    'type_of_intention',\n    'type_of_solving_question',\n    #'type_of_starter',\n    'lectures_seen',\n    'seen_before',\n    'avg_q_time',\n    'lag_time',\n]\n\ntarget = 'answered_correctly'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Deleting the portion of the dataset which we got our statistics from to free up some memory."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"del train_questions_only_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preprocessing functions\n\nThe following functions are crucial to this notebook.

I experiemented with this a little bit near the end and found thtat by dropping the features with low importance and increasing the size of the training dataset I can see improvenements in my model score.\n\nI would also have liked to experiment more with deep learning models as this was such a large dataset and these kind of models perform very well on large datasets. I did attempt to create a deep learning model, but it was not as accurate as the LGB I trained.. Still unsure if this was due to hyperparamter tuning, selected layers, or data preprocessing.\n\n### Things I would like to improve on\n\nThe big takeway from this competition is that I really need to become more proficcient in using deep learning models on tabular datasets. I have spent a good portion of time on this already, and am learning something new everyday.\n\nFurthermore, I have been exploring automated layer optimization frameworks in order to give myy deep learning models the best structure. Other than fine hyperparameter tuning, it seems seems that there is no framework out there that will optimize layers. Maybe once I understand a bit more about the topic, maybe I could create a package myself?"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
