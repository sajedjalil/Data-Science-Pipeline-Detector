The idea of this jumble of code is to explore how to approach this problem without too much technical knowledge. Over the previous year I learned a lot about graph theory and reinforcement learning, so I am using this competition to test some concepts.\n\nAs a start the issue at hand can be phrased as a graph problem. Chaining the different permutations of the symbols is equivalent of following a route through this graph, the nodes or vertices being the permutations. What is interesting is that this graph is fully connected (you can go directly from each node a to node b), the graph is weighted and directed (the distance from node a to node b is not the same as the distance from node b to node a). This is reflected in the form of the distance matrix, also known as adjacency matrix, which is dense, (almost) no zeros and asymmetric.\n\nOn this graph, you have three agents that try to cover all of it as efficiently as possible, with a subset of the nodes that need to be covered by all of them first. This splits the problem in two parts:\n\n1. Go through the first 120 nodes (permutations with fixed first two entries, 120 = (7 - 2)! = 5!). This is a path with a fixed length (120 * 7 = 840) and if I am correct it is not possible to shorten it. However, what is possible is to choose paths that go through more than 120 nodes. Think of this as in 2d three nodes being on a straight line connecting them, if you from node one to three you have to go through two. This allows to cover more nodes that 120 in the first part of the route. Also, the three agents do not need to take the same route/order for these first 120 nodes. In fact, you want them to be as different as possible to cover more nodes. This can be realized for example by the first agent going through the nodes in order, the second agent in reverse order and the third agent going first through the even and then the odd nodes. (The nodes always have some id on which you can sort them). We optimize this by randomly permutating two elements of a random list to cover more nodes with the starting three routes.\n\n2. After having found the first part of the three routes, we greedily add the remaining nodes to the three routes. This means that we try to find for each route the next node with the shortest distance to the last node of each route and then add the node which will lead to the minimum increase in max length of all routes. As the selection of the next node is not necessarily unique, we break ties by choosing randomly from the eligible candidates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tqdm\nimport random\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom random import randint, sample, choice","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.414575Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.415106Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.419812Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.415072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.418616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"****","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"permutations = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/santa-2021/permutations.csv\")\ndistances = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/santa-2021/distance_matrix.csv\")\npermutations_ = [p[0] for p in permutations.values].copy()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.749155Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.749499Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.125491Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-31T11:26:34.749437Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.124754Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"permutations.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.126888Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.127245Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.148835Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.127215Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-31T11:26:40.147699Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Distance Formatting\nWe format the distance matrix as a map that maps each permutations to a map of distances, for each distance a list of all the permutations with that distance.
