This year, your challenge is to optimize the scheduling of seven movies.\n\nThis problem can be stated like this:\n\nFind a set of three strings containing every permutation of the seven symbols 🎅, 🤶, 🦌, 🧝, 🎄, 🎁, and 🎀 as substrings, subject to the following conditions:\n\n- Every permutation must be in at least one string.\n- Each permutation beginning with 🎅🤶 must be in all three strings.\n- Each string may have up to two wildcards 🌟, which will match any symbol in a permutation. No string of length seven containing more than one wildcard will count as a permutation.\n- Your score is the length of the longest of the three strings, with lower scores better.\n\nSee this competition's [Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/overview/evaluation) page for more details.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll see how the elves' movie-scheduling problem can be formulated as a type of **minimal superpermutation problem** and also as a type of **traveling salesman** or **routing problem**. We'll implement this latter formulation in Google's open-source [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) optimization library to create a submission.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016657,"end_time":"2021-10-18T00:04:02.126968","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-10-18T00:04:02.110311","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Minimal Superpermutation Problem #\n\nA **permutation** over a set of symbols is a particular arrangement of those symbols. For instance, there are six permutations of the symbols 1, 2, and 3: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321. Notice that (allowing overlap) these permutations can be packed together very efficiently into longer strings. The permutations 123 and 231, for example, are both substrings of 1231, a string of length four. Extending this by one character to 12312, we can include a third permutation, 312. In fact, *every* permutation over 1, 2, 3 can be found within a string of length 9, the string 123121321.\n\nStrings that contain every permutation of some set of symbols are called **superpermutations**. The **minimal superpermutation problem** asks: how short can superpermutations actually be? Exact answers are known for $ n \\leq 5 $ symbols, but for $ n \\geq 6 $ researchers have resorted to discovering superpermutations through various search and optimization techniques.\n\nWe can see now that the elves' scheduling problem is a variation on this minimal superpermutation problem, with three strings instead of one and the addition of a \"wildcard\" symbol. A lot of work has been done on superpermutations already, which you might like to use for inspiration. Check out [Greg Egan's Superpermutation page](https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Superpermutations/Superpermutations.html) for a great introduction to current methods.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010468,"end_time":"2021-10-18T00:04:02.152272","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-10-18T00:04:02.141804","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Traveling Salesman Formulation #\n\nBy defining the notion of a distance on permutations, we can view the superpermutation and movie scheduling problems as kinds of traveling salesman or [routing](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing) problems.\n\nWe saw in the last section how we could add a single character to 123 to get a string also containing 231 (the string 1231). This tells us that the *distance* from 123 to 231 is 1 (one character). More generally, we define the **distance** from a permutation p to a permutation q by:\n\n$$ d(p, q) = \\text{number of characters you have to append to } p \\text{ to get a string also containing } q $$\n\nwhich in Python we could implement as:\n\n``` python\ndef distance(p, q):\n    N = len(p)\n    for n in range(N+1):\n        if p[n:] == q[:N-n]:\n            return n\n```\n\nThis function essentially measures the deficiency of overlap from the end of p to the beginning of q.
