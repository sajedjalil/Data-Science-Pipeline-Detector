([citation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642583.2019.1674220#:~:text=MTSP%20involves%20assigning%20m%20salesmen%20to%20n%20cities%2C%20and%20each%20city%20must%20be%20visited%20by%20a%20salesman%20while%20requiring%20a%20minimum%20total%20cost.))\n\nHowever, MTSP is applicable to only the cases in which multiple executing individuals (traveling salesman) share the common workspace (city set). It cannot be used to handle many multi-machine engineering systems where multiple machines' workspaces are not the same and partially overlap with each other. [This paper](https://doi.org/10.3182/20140824-6-ZA-1003.01403) proposed and formulated a new MTSP called colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP). Each of its salesmen is assigned a private city set and all salesmen share a public city set. Every set of cities is colored differently. ([citation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016431289?via%3Dihub#:~:text=However%2C%20it%20is,is%20colored%20differently.))\n\nCTSP looks like a good match for our problem where three sets of permutations beginning with 🎅🤶 that must be found in each string will be our \"private city sets\" and all the other permutations will represent a \"public city set\". The use of wildcards is still not easily translated to these settings.\n\nLuckily our old friend the [LKH-3](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/) supports CSTP instances. All we need to do is to solve three problems:\n1. figure out the LKH input format for CTSP instances;\n2. understand the LKH output tour format for CTSP instances;\n3. make LKH work with asymmetric CTSP instances.\n\nLet's do it step by step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. CTSP Input Format\n\nAt the [LKH-3](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/) page we can download CTSP instances by clicking [CTSP](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/BENCHMARKS/CTSP.tgz) link. Let's have a look at the CTSP instance `/CTSP/INSTANCES/Eil/eil21-3.ctsp`:\n\n```\nNAME : eil21-3\nCOMMENT : 21-city problem (Christofides/Eilon)\nTYPE : CTSP\nDIMENSION : 21\nSALESMEN : 3\nEDGE_WEIGHT_TYPE : EUC_2D\nNODE_COORD_SECTION\n1 42 41\n  *** 19 lines with nodes' coordinates are omitted ***\n21 38 35\nCTSP_SET_SECTION\n1 2 3 4 5 -1\n2 6 7 8 9 -1\n3 10 11 12 13 -1\nDEPOT_SECTION\n1\n-1\nEOF\n```\n\nAs we can see the CTSP input format is pretty straightforward, all we need to do compared to the ATSP input format is to:\n* change problem type: `TYPE : CTSP` instead of `TYPE : ATSP`;\n* specify the number of salesmen: `SALESMEN : 3`;\n* provide \"private city sets\" under the `CTSP_SET_SECTION` keyword, each set starts with its index \\\\((1, 2, 3)\\\\) followed by nodes' IDs in this set and ends with -\\\\(1\\\\);\n* specify the node all salesmen will start their routes from under the `DEPOT_SECTION` keyword.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. CTSP Output Tour Format\n\nEach CTSP instance downloaded above has corresponding output tour found by LKH.

But the dimension of the tour \\\\((23)\\\\) is not the same as of the problem \\\\((21)\\\\), there are two nodes that are not present in the problem, the first salesman starts his route from the depot node and each additional salesman starts his route from an additional node.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. Dealing with an Asymmetric CTSP\n\nNow after finding out the input and output CTSP formats for LKH we can write CTSP instance file and initial tour file for our problem and feed it to the LKH, but all we'll get is garbage because LKH expects CTSP to be symmetric, whereas our problem is asymmetric because the distance between permutations is not symmetric, i.e. there are such permutations \\\\(p\\\\) and \\\\(q\\\\) that \\\\(d(p,q) \\ne d(q, p)\\\\), where \\\\(d(p, q)\\\\) is the distance between \\\\(p\\\\) and \\\\(q\\\\).\n\nTo deal with this problem we will use the approach from the [paper](http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~rkumar/PUBS/atsp.pdf) to convert an asymmetric TSP (ATSP) to a symmetric one (STSP) by doubling its size. Below is a short description of such conversion.\n\nLet \\\\(D_{n \\times n}\\\\) be an asymmetric distance matrix for a TSP of size n. Then authors define\n\\\\[d_{\\max }:=\\max _{i \\neq j} d_{i j} ; \\quad d_{\\min }:=\\min _{i \\neq j} d_{i j}\\\\]\n\nAuthors define the distance matrix \\\\(D^{\\prime}=\\left[d_{i j}^{\\prime}\\right]_{n \\times n}\\\\) as follows:\n\\\\[\\forall i, j: d_{i j}^{\\prime}:= \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if } i=j \\\\ d_{i j} & \\text { if }\\left[4 d_{\\min }-3 d_{\\max }\\right]>0, i \\neq j \\\\ d_{i j}+\\left[3 d_{\\max }-4 d_{\\min }+\\epsilon\\right] & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\\\\]\n\nUsing the asymmetric distance matrix \\\\(D^{\\prime}\\\\) authors define a symmetric distance matrix \\\\(\\bar{D}=\\left[\\bar{d}_{i j}\\right]_{2 n \\times 2 n}\\\\) which is a desired symmetric distance matrix:\n\\\\[\\bar{D}:=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\infty & \\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\top} \\\\\n\\hline D^{\\prime} & \\infty\n\\end{array}\\right]\\\\]\n\nFor notational simplicity, given \\\\(i \\leq n\\\\), authors use \\\\(\\left[i\\right]\\\\) to denote \\\\(i + n\\\\). Thus \\\\(\\left[1\\right] = 1 + n, \\left[n\\right] = 2n\\\\), etc. Authors call \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(\\left[i\\right]\\\\) to be a complementary pair of nodes. Furthermore, for each \\\\(i \\leq n\\\\), the node \\\\(i\\\\) is called a real node, whereas the node \\\\(\\left[i\\right]\\\\) is called a virtual node. Authors note that for each \\\\(i, j,\\\\)\n\\\\[\\bar{d}_{i j}=\\bar{d}_{[i][j]}=\\infty ; \\quad \\bar{d}_{[i] j}=\\bar{d}_{j[i]}=d_{i j}^{\\prime} ; \\quad \\bar{d}_{[i] i}=\\bar{d}_{i[i]}=d_{i i}^{\\prime}=0\\\\]\n\nIn other words, the distance between a pair of real or virtual nodes is infinity, whereas the distance between a real\nand virtual node is finite and symmetric, and the distance between a complementary pair of nodes is zero.\n\nThis way the tour \\\\[T=i_{1} \\rightarrow i_{2} \\rightarrow \\ldots \\rightarrow i_{n}\\\\] in initial asymmetric settings translates to the tour\n\\\\[\\bar{T}=i_{1} \\rightarrow\\left[i_{1}\\right] \\rightarrow i_{2} \\rightarrow\\left[i_{2}\\right] \\rightarrow \\ldots \\rightarrow i_{n} \\rightarrow\\left[i_{n}\\right]\\\\] in the defined symmetric settings. And the authors show that the optimal tour in the difined symmetric settings corresponds to the optimal tour in the initial asymmetric settings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Merry Movie Montage as CTSP\n\nAll is left for us to do is to implement the above ideas in code.\n\nWe have \\\\(5280\\\\) real nodes and \\\\(5280\\\\) virtual nodes, first \\\\(360\\\\) nodes will represent three sets of our mandatory permutations (private city sets), the depot node will be the last with the ID equal to \\\\(2 \\cdot 5280 + 1 = 10561\\\\).\n\nIn our case \\\\(d_{\\max } = 7\\\\) and \\\\(d_{\\min } = 1\\\\).\n\n\\\\(3 d_{\\max }-4 d_{\\min } = 21 - 4 = 17\\\\).
