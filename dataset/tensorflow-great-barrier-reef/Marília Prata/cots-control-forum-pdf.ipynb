There are also reports of COTS on fringing reefs around islands to the north – Nguna, Pele, Espiritu Santo – as well as islands in the south of the country – Tanna.\"\n\n\"Due to limited resources and high accessibility of fringing reefs, COTS control is haphazard through a voluntary program, and only some data (e.g. number of COTS culled) are documented using an online reporting system1. Marine tourism operators and community groups are leading the initiative using injector kits to cull COTS, and remote villages without kits are removing COTS manually and burning or burying them. Critically, a network of committed marine stakeholders are reporting sightings of COTS in high densities and responding accordingly with collective culling efforts. Communities have also used a ‘bounty’ system as incentive to remove COTS, with Pele Island addressing a recent outbreak and protecting their high-value eco-tourism reefs.\"\n\n\"An intensive 6-months of control in 2020 removed over 5,600 COTS and identified hotspot areas around Pango Peninsula and in Mele Bay.

A modernisation program would seek to improve speed and depth range, apply geolocations to individual observations, adopt artificial intelligence / machine learning (AIML) to reduce latency in data analysis, archive vision for repurposing datasets to address future research questions, increase survey repeatability, and reduce personnel requirements.\"\n\n\"Vertigo3 achieves these objectives in a suitcase-sized ‘towed glider’, 650mm in wingspan and weighing 5kg. Vertigo3’s design philosophy focusses on overcoming four physical constraints: towing the robotic device behind a small boat provides the energy required to overcome the density of the medium and to combat tidal velocities; the absence of GPS signals or other reef-wide positioning systems is mitigated by calculating offsets from the vessel’s GPS, and by on-board sensors that allow image rectification and georeferencing; underwater bandwidth limits are overcome by a reinforced fibre optic tow cable that provides gigabit bandwidth so that the surface operator sees live streaming vision with real-time AIML augmentation;  and operations in topographically complex environments are facilitated by a strategy of small size and I mass, authoritative 3-axis flight controls and fast fusion of terrain-following sensors.\"\n\nIn its current incarnation Vertigo3 operates comfortably to 7kts and 15m depth, capturing 500,000 5MP images per day, with real-time ML models operating at 10 frames per second. The device autopilots with minimal inputs from the vessel coxswain, allowing for single-handed operations.

Vertigo3 appears amenable to adaptation for crown-of-thorns starfish management, with geolocation, immediacy of starfish detection, AIML and larger/faster survey footprints potentially offering opportunities to refine management field methods and productivity. Vertigo3 is intended to become an open sourced tool for marine biophysical surveys, and its developers are currently seeking collaborations to build new use cases.\"\n\nhttps://www.rrrc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-International-COTS-Control-Forum-Program-DIGITAL.pdf","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Salman Ibne Eunus https://www.kaggle.com/salmaneunus/pdf2text-ocr-named-entity-recognition\n\nfrom spacy import displacy\ndisplacy.render(nlp(doc.text), style = 'ent', jupyter=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-24T01:23:52.417262Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-24T01:23:52.417621Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-24T01:23:52.443185Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-24T01:23:52.417574Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-24T01:23:52.442219Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Ocean warming and changes in the behaviour and physiology of crown-of-thorns starfish\n\nAuthors: Bethan Lang, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia\n\n\"Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris.; COTS) and climate change are two of the most prominent threats to the Great Barrier Reef, however there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding how COTS may fare in a warmer ocean.\"\n\n\"Some studies have demonstrated that the immature stages of COTS are sensitive to warming, potentially a result of the relatively stable thermal environment they experience in the tropics.
