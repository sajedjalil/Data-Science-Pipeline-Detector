Glomeruli are mainly found in the renal **cortex**, while the renal **medulla** contains mainly the renal tubule. Since we are dealing with biological structures, the separation is not not absolute and the transitions are not always perfectly sharp.\n\n![Diagram of a nephron](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1842/2017/05/26234530/m9skcbftjqzrokkkopam.png)\n[Diagram of a nephron from libretexts.org, Introductory and General Biology](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_General_Biology_(Boundless)/41%3A_Osmotic_Regulation_and_the_Excretory_System/41.4%3A_Human_Osmoregulatory_and_Excretory_Systems/41.4B%3A_Nephron%3A_The_Functional_Unit_of_the_Kidney)\n\n## Key Idea\n\nA common approach to deal with the very large (>500MB - 5GB) TIFF files in the dataset is to decompose the images in smaller patches/tiles, for instance by using a sliding window apporach.\n> **Knowing that the glomeruli are mainly found in the cortex, we should focus on this region during training**. \n\nInstead of preprocessing the images by saving them into fixed tiles, we prepare the data to sample random tiles from the entire images with a higher probability to sample tiles that contain glomeruli and cortex.\n\n**We combine two sampling apporaches**\n\n> 1. Sampling tiles that contain all glomeruli - this ensures that each glomerulus is seen during one epoch of training at least once. \n> 2. Sampling random tiles based on region probabilites (e.g., medulla; cortex)\n\n*Note: We startet out by only using the second approach (see our public kernel https://www.kaggle.com/matjes/hubmap-labels-pdf-0-5-0-25-0-01). However, we realized that due to the randomness of the sampling sometimes not all glomeruli were drawn during training. Thus, we added the first step.*\n\n## Advantages of this approaches\n\nIn combination with [deepflash2](https://github.com/matjesg/deepflash2/tree/master/) and the deepflash2 [pytorch datasets](https://matjesg.github.io/deepflash2/data.html#Datasets) in particular, this approach has several advantages:\n- no preprocessing of the data (only saving them to .zarr files for memory efficient loading)\n    - flexible tile shapes (input shapes, e.g. 1024, 512, 256) at runtime\n    - flexible scaling (e.g., by facors of 2,3,4)\n- faster convergence during traing\n    - focusing on the relevant regions (e.g., tiles that contain glomeruli and cortex)\n    - \"additional\" data augmentation from random sampling (compared to fixed windows)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Implementation (masks and probability density function)\n\nThe data preprocessing steps in this notebook comprise\n- Creating segmentations masks from RLE\n- Creating a data frame containing position information on each glomerulus in the segmentation mask\n- Creating probability density function (PDF) for efficient sampling from mask and anatmical structure\n\n**Inputs**\n- RLE glomeruli segmentations ([challenge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hubmap-kidney-segmentation/data))\n- Anatomical region masks ([.zarr converted](https://www.kaggle.com/matjes/hubmap-pdf-zarr))\n   \n**Settings**\n\n- Probability for cortex regions (`cortex_p`): 0.7 \n- Probability for medulla regions (`medulla_p`): 0.2\n- Probability for other regions (`bg_p` (background)): 0.1    \n\nWe chose the region sampling probabilites based on expert knowledge and some experiements.
