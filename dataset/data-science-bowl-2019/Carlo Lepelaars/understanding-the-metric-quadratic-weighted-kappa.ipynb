First, an N x N histogram matrix $O$ is constructed, such that $O_{i,j}$ corresponds to the number of installation_ids $i$ (actual) that received a predicted value $j$. An N-by-N matrix of weights, $w$, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:\n\n$w_{i,j} = \\frac{\\left(i-j\\right)^2}{\\left(N-1\\right)^2}$\n\nAn N-by-N histogram matrix of expected outcomes, $E$, is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that $E$ and $O$ have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as: \n\n$\\kappa=1-\\frac{\\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}O_{i,j}}{\\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}E_{i,j}}.$\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that Quadratic Weighted Kappa score is a ratio that can take a value between -1 and 1. A negative QWK score implies that the model is \"worse than random\". A random model should give a score of close to 0.
