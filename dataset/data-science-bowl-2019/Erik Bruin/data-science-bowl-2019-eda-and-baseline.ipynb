In this challenge, you’ll use anonymous gameplay data, including knowledge of videos watched and games played, from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready To Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. Your solutions will aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.\n\n**Where does the data for the competition come from?**\nThe data used in this competition is anonymous, tabular data of interactions with the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. Select data, such as a user’s in-app assessment score or their path through the game, is collected by the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool.\n\n**What is the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app?**\nIn the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, children ages 3 to 5 learn early STEM concepts focused on length, width, capacity, and weight while going on an adventure through Treetop City, Magma Peak, and Crystal Caves. Joined by their favorite PBS KIDS characters, children can also collect rewards and unlock digital toys as they play. \n\nBesides the info provided above by Kaggle, I found the following additional info on the website of the app:\n\nSpecific features of Measure Up! include:\n\n* 19 unique measuring games.\n* 10 measurement-focused video clips.\n* Sticker books featuring favorite PBS KIDS characters.\n* Rewards for completion of tasks.\n* Embedded challenges and reports to help parents and caregivers monitor kids’ progress.\n* Ability to track your child's progress using the PBS KIDS Super Vision companion app.\n\n**Evaluation**\nSubmissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.\n\nThe outcomes in this competition are grouped into 4 groups (labeled accuracy_group in the data):\n\n3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt\n\n2: the assessment was solved on the second attempt\n\n1: the assessment was solved after 3 or more attempts\n\n0: the assessment was never solved\n\n\n\nFor each installation_id represented in the test set, you must predict the accuracy_group of the last assessment for that installation_id.\n\nNote that the training set contains many installation_ids which never took assessments, whereas every installation_id in the test set made an attempt on at least one assessment.\n\nThe file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. Assessment attempts are captured in event_code 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses event_code 4110. If the attempt was correct, it contains \"correct\":true."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of contents\n\n* [1.
