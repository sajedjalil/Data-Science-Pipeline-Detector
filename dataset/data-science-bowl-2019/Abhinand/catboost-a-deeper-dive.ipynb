In fact, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest are my favorite ML models for tabular heterogeneous datasets. These models are the top performers on Kaggle competitions and are used widely in the industry.\n\nSo what is CatBoost you may ask. It is known as **Categorical Gradient Boosting.**. (If that didn't annoy you, there are no cats in ML atleast as of now)\n\n> **CatBoost is based on gradient boosting. A relatively new machine learning technique developed by Yandex that outperforms many other existing boosting algorithms like XGBoost and Light GBM.**\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*2p1GIUUcRSzyyJjSj4x7Iw.jpeg\" style=\"width:60%\"></img>\n\n\n## What's cool?\nWhile deep learning algorithms requires lots of data and computational power, boosting algorithms are still in need for most of the business problems. However boosting algorithms like XGBoost takes hours to train and sometimes you’ll get frustrated while tuning hyper-parameters.\n\nOn the other hand, CatBoost is **easy to implement and very powerful**. It provides impressive results in it’s very first run.\n\n> One main difference between CatBoost and other boosting algorithms is that the CatBoost implements **symmetric trees**. This may sound crazy but helps in **decreasing prediction time**, which is extremely important for low latency environments.\n\n\n## Why CatBoost matters?\n\n**1. Improved Results**\n\nCatboost achieves the best results on the benchmark, and that’s great. (Although the company who conducted the benchmark has a clear interest in the favor of Catboost 😅) Though, when you look at datasets where categorical features play a large role, such as Amazon and the Internet datasets, this improvement becomes significant and undeniable.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1818/1*vsg1IUlGtzCoNuGo9XqGwg.png\" style=\"width:70%\"></img>\n\n**2. FAST**\n\nWhile training time can take up longer than other GBDT implementations, prediction time is 13–16 times faster than the other libraries according to the Yandex benchmark\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1664/1*BE8PZe54DMWe6gFdHlYsxg.png\" style=\"width:70%\"></img>\n\n**3. Tried and Tested:**\n\nYandex is relying heavily on Catboost for ranking, forecasting and recommendations. This model is serving more than 70 million users each month.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Yandex_Logo.svg/1200px-Yandex_Logo.svg.png\"

Below is an explanation of CatBoost using a toy example\n\nLet’s say, we have 10 data points in our dataset and are ordered in time as shown below.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/303/1*K-2XayuU9Y4OklIlDWg1AQ.png\"></img>\n\n> If data doesn’t have time, CatBoost randomly creates an artificial time for each datapoint.\n\n* **Step 1:** Calculate residuals for each datapoint using a model that has been trained on all the other data points at that time (For Example, to calculate residual for x5 datapoint, we train one model using x1, x2, x3 and x4 ). Hence we train different models for different data points . At the end we are calculating residuals for each datapoint that it’s corresponding model has never seen that datapoint before.\n* **Step 2:** Train the model using the residuals of each datapoint\n* **Step 3:** Repeat Step 1 & Step 2 (for n iterations)\n\nFor the above toy dataset, we should train 9 different models to get residuals for 9 data points. This is computationally expensive when we have more number of data points.\nHence by default, instead of training different model for each datapoint, it trains only log(num_of_datapoints) models. Now if a model has been trained on n data points then that model is used to calculate residuals for the next n data points.\n\n* A model that has been trained on first data point is used for calculating residuals of second data point.\n* An another model that has been trained on the first two data points is used for calculating residuals of third and fourth data points\n\nIn the above toy dataset, now we calculate residuals of x5,x6,x7 and x8 using a model that has been trained on x1, x2,x3 and x4.\n\nAll this procedure that I have explained until now is known as ordered boosting\n\n**Random Permutations:**\n\nCatBoost actually divides a given dataset into random permutations and apply ordered boosting on those random permutations. By default CatBoost creates four random permutations. With this randomness we can further stop overfitting our model. We can further control this randomness by tuning parameter bagging_temperature. This is something that you have already seen in other boosting algorithms"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Categorical Feature Handling\n\n### Ordered Target Statistic:\n\nMost of the GBDT algorithms and Kaggle competitors are already familiar with the use of Target Statistic (or target mean encoding).\n\n> It’s a simple yet effective approach in which we encode each categorical feature with the estimate of the expected target y conditioned by the category.\n\nWell, it turns out that applying this encoding carelessly (average value of y over the training examples with the same category) results in a target leakage.\n\nTo fight this prediction shift CatBoost uses a more effective strategy. It relies on the ordering principle and is inspired by online learning algorithms which get training examples sequentially in time. In this setting, the values of TS for each example rely only on the observed history.\n\nTo adapt this idea to a standard offline setting, Catboost introduces an artificial “time”— a random permutation σ1 of the training examples.\n\nThen, for each example, it uses all the available “history” to compute its Target Statistic.\nNote that, using only one random permutation, results in preceding examples with higher variance in Target Statistic than subsequent ones. To this end, CatBoost uses different permutations for different steps of gradient boosting.\n\n### One-Hot Encoding:\n\n* By default, CatBoost internally represents all the categorical features with One-hot encoding if and only if a categorical feature has two different categories.\n\n* If you would like to implement One-hot encoding on a categorical feature that has N different categories then you can change parameter one_hot_max_size = N."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Handling Numerical Features\n\nCatBoost handle the numerical features in the same way that other tree algorithms do.
