I don't know if it's possible. Thus, I put plotly plot under the two easy plots. \n\nThe excution times show that the seaborn used least time while the plotly is the most time consuming code. Also I looked at the size of saved iPynb file which is 100+ Mb for only one plotly plot. The interactive plot is good and cool, but does it worth the time and memory. Also I found my Mac was slow after running the plotly. I don't know if it's because of it. \n\nAnother think I found confusing is that I set `nbinsx = 50` in plotly.

I didn't add xlabel and ylabel in plotly plot because I don't want to wait another 16 seconds. \n\nTo my surprice, the excution time for `pandas.DataFrame.plot.hist()` is 12s which is way larger than the excution time for `seaborn`.

I wanted to try more plots but somehow my Mac ran very slowly after excuting three plotly plots. I have 8 Gb of memory and the python used about 2.6G even when I am not running any cells. If you want to do the EDA just for yourself, seeaborn, plt and plot function in pandas are all very convinient and quick. If you want to present your visualization products to someone else, the plotly can give you a excellent interactive interface where you can embed a lot of information in it. But in that way, you will sacrafise a lot of memory and time. Maybe some expert on Kaggle will have a better understanding than me. I hope you can point out my mistakes in this kernel since this is my first share. At last, hope you all get good rank on LB.
