Be warned though that the actual photometric redshift distribution is asymmetric, and the redshift is not likely to be less than zero, so you might want to treat it as just a weight. Why is the redshift unlikely to be less than 0... we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nThe test set does not have spectroscopic redshifts for all sources. There's a few because we simulate occasionally getting lucky and finding a new source in a galaxy which already had spectroscopy, but the vast majority of them will be `NaN`. You could potentially try to use the training set, together with the subset of the test data that does have both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to make a better redshift predictor if you like, or you could ignore it altogether.\n\nThat said, redshift is a great feature! We know how to separate extragalactic and galactic sources pretty well, so we simulate this ability by setting the redshifts of galactic sources to exactly `0`. That tells you they are within the galaxy and reduces the size of the possible models they might be, but doesn't identify which is which - that's still your challenge!

And you might have heard that it isn't possible to go faster than the speed of light. This is how the cosmological redshift differs from the Doppler effect. It's not the physical motion of the sources that is causing the change in frequency, but rather the expansion of the Universe itself - that the space between us and the source is stretching! Your PLAsTiCC dataset will include objects up to a redshift of 3. \n\nIf everything seems to be moving away with respect to us on Earth, you might also be tempted to think we're the center of the expansion of the Universe. We aren't. We could move to any other point in the Universe and we'd see the same behavior.
