Problem formulation\n\nWe formulate the task as question answering problem: given a question and a context, we train a transformer model to find the **answer** in the `text` column (the context).\n\nWe have:\n 1. Question: `sentiment` column (`positive` or `negative`)\n 2. Context:  `text` column\n 3. Answer: `selected_text` column\n\n\n### 2. Getting started with QA\n\nA great resource to quickly recap question answering is this great amazing Stanford Lecture: [Question Answering](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/watsonqa.pdf).\n\n#### 2.1 Other free online resources:\n\n - [Youtube: Stanford CS224N - Question Answering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIdF-17HwSk)\n - [Medium: Building a Question-Answering System from Scratch— Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507)\n - [Github: awesome question answering](https://github.com/seriousran/awesome-qa)\n\n\n### 3. Learning QA from scratch\n\nThe final project of the Stanford course CS224n, **Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** consist of creating (almost) from scratch a Question-Ansering system using deep neural nets and transformers. [Here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/default-final-project-handout.pdf) you can find the handout of 24 pages. For the most enthusiast out there: you may want to do this project and implement your Question-Answering system. It's probably the best way to fully understand and learn what QA is about.\n\n### 4. Model: DistilBERT + SQuAD\n\nThe current version of the notebook makes use of the `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` model.\n\nDistilBERT paper: [DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)\n\n> As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.\n\nThe distilBERT model has already been fine-tuned on a question-answering challenge: SQuAD, the [Stanford Question Answering Dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). This is the main reason why it performs already well out-of-the-box (0.666 score in the LB).\n\n#### 4.1 Training time\n\nThanks to the limited size of the transformer model, the notebook runs quite fast, training time is about 20 minutes with _GPU_.\n\n\n### 5. Dataset publicly available\n\n#### 5.1 DistilBERT + SQuAD model\nBecause Tweet Sentiment Extraction's notebooks must have internet switched off, I already downloaded and stored the transformer model in a public Kaggle dataset: [Transformers pre-trained distilBERT models](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/transformers-pretrained-distilbert). In future, I plan to upload all [distilBERT pre-trained models](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) to the same dataset so that we can easily play around with many models and configuration.\n\n#### 5.2 Simple Transformers PyPI\n\nTo keep the code to-the-point, this notebook makes use of an external python package: [simpletransformers](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers). For your convenience, the wheel files to install the package have already been stored in this database: [Simple Transformers PyPI](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/simple-transformers-pypi).\n\n\n### 6.
