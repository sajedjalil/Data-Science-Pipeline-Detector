NER is a common task in natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. In this task you will experiment to recognize named entities from Twitter.\n\nFor example, we want to extract persons' and organizations' names from the text. Than for the input text:\n\n    Ian Goodfellow works for Google Brain\n\na NER model needs to provide the following sequence of tags:\n\n    B-PER I-PER    O     O   B-ORG  I-ORG\n\nWhere *B-* and *I-* prefixes stand for the beginning and inside of the entity, while *O* stands for out of tag or no tag. Markup with the prefix scheme is called *BIO markup*. This markup is introduced for distinguishing of consequent entities with similar types.\n\nA solution of the task will be based on neural networks, particularly, on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs).\n\n### Libraries\n\nFor this task you will need the following libraries:\n - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) — an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\n \nIn this assignment, we use Tensorflow 1.15.0. You can install it with pip:\n\n    !pip install tensorflow==1.15.0\n     \n - [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) — a package for scientific computing.\n \nIf you have never worked with Tensorflow, you would probably need to read some tutorials during your work on this assignment, e.g. [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent) could be a good starting point.
