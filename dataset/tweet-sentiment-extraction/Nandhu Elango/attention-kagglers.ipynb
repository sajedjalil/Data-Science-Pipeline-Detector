I.e. decoder neurons receive addition input (via Attention) from the encoder states/activations. So in this case Attention connects 2 different components - encoder and decoder. If Self-attention is applied - it doesn't connect 2 different components, it's applied within one component\n\n* Self-attention may be applied many times independently within a single model (e.g. 18 times in Transformer, 12 times in BERT BASE) while Attention is usually applied once in the model and connects some 2 components (e.g. encoder and decoder).\n\n* Self-attention is good at modeling dependencies between different parts of the sequence. For example - understand the syntactic function between words in the sentence. Attention on the other hand models only the dependencies between 2 different sequences (for example, the original text and the translation of the text).
