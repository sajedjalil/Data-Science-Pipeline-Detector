This helps the classifier in understanding the words more at the level of their meaning. The dimension of embedding to be used in this example is 13. The fourth root of vocabulary size (25330) is used as per the good rule of thumb. However, increase in dimensionality increases the quality of embedding. But this might go useless when large enough data is not available. So, I am using 13 dimension word embedding.\n### Dense Layer\nAfter Embedding layer, we have a global_average_pooling1d layer which is responsible for converting the 2d values from embedding layer into 1d by flattening them. This is done so that it can be fed into the next dense layer which requires one dimensional input.

The model is performing decently but one way to improve the model performance is by using Bigrams instead of single words separately. That way we could capture better contextual meaning. 'not great' and 'is great' cannot be put under positive just because they have the word 'great' in them. And similarly, 'not good' and 'not bad' can also get confusing when considering one word at a time. Whereas Bigrams can come in helpful in such scenarios.
