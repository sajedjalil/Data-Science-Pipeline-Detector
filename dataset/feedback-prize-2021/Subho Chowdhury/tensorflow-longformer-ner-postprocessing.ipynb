Currently this notebook uses\n* backbone LongFormer\n* NER formulation\n* one fold\n\nWith simple changes, we can convert this notebook into Question Answer formulation and we can try different backbones. Furthermore this notebook is one fold. It trains with 90% data and validates on 10% data. We can convert this notebook to K-fold or train with 100% data for boost in LB.\n\nThe transformer model LongFormer is explained [here][1]. It is similar to Roberta but can accept inputs as wide as 4096 tokens! In this notebook we feed the transformer with 1024 wide tokens. HuggingFace user AllenAI uploaded pretrained weights for us [here][2]. Kaggle discussion about this starter notebook is [here][4]\n\n# PyTorch BigBird NER Baseline - CV 0.615\nI published a PyTorch starter notebook [here][3] that uses BigBird backbone. BigBird is another recent SOTA transformer that accomodates tokens as wide as 4096. Unfortunately there are not pretrained BigBird weights for TensorFlow-Keras. \n\nTensorFlow users can benefit from reading the PyTorch starter because the PyTorch encodes the targets differently. It uses the `predictionstring` column and `is_split_into_words=True` during tokenization. It also demonstrates how to use a dataloader which is needed if you want to experiment with data augmentation. Because each epoch, we must tokenize the text again after modifying the train text.\n\n[1]: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/longformer\n[2]: https://huggingface.co/allenai/longformer-base-4096\n[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/pytorch-bigbird-ner-cv-0-615\n[4]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/discussion/295794","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Configuration\nThis notebook can either train a new model or load a previously trained model (made from previous notebook version).

Please upvote Qrdl's notebook :-) Qrdl has been running experiments and found a great learning rate to use when training with small batch size.\n\nWhen training on Kaggle's 1xP100 GPU, we need to reduce the batch size to 4. And we reduce the learning rates to `0.25e-4` and `0.25e-5`. I have updated the batch size and learning rate below so that it is ready to train in a Kaggle notebook! (Each training epoch on Kaggle takes 1 hour 8 minutes).\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggleqrdl/v4expmt-tensorflow-longformer-ner-cv-0-634?scriptVersionId=83341823","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# LEARNING RATE SCHEDULE AND MODEL CHECKPOINT\nEPOCHS = 5\nBATCH_SIZE = 4 \nLRS = [0.25e-4, 0.25e-4, 0.25e-4, 0.25e-4, 0.25e-5] \ndef lrfn(epoch):\n    return LRS[epoch]\nlr_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(lrfn, verbose = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T17:55:20.979229Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T17:55:20.979812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T17:55:20.984587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T17:55:20.979775Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T17:55:20.983681Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TRAIN VALID SPLIT 90% 10%\nnp.random.seed(42)\ntrain_idx = np.random.choice(np.arange(len(IDS)),int(0.9*len(IDS)),replace=False)\nvalid_idx = np.setdiff1d(np.arange(len(IDS)),train_idx)\nnp.random.seed(None)\nprint('Train size',len(train_idx),', Valid size',len(valid_idx))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T17:55:23.162556Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T17:55:23.163293Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T17:55:23.181756Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T17:55:23.163242Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T17:55:23.18093Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# LOAD MODEL\nif LOAD_MODEL_FROM:\n#     model.load_weights(f'{LOAD_MODEL_FROM}/long_v{VER}.h5')\n    model.load_weights('../input/tflongformerv14/long_v14.h5')\n    \n# OR TRAIN MODEL\nelse:\n    model.fit(x = [train_tokens[train_idx,], train_attention[train_idx,]],\n          y = targets[train_idx,],\n          validation_data = ([train_tokens[valid_idx,], train_attention[valid_idx,]],\n                             targets[valid_idx,]),\n          callbacks = [lr_callback],\n          epochs = EPOCHS,\n          batch_size = BATCH_SIZE,\n          verbose = 2)\n\n    # SAVE MODEL WEIGHTS\n    model.save_weights(f'long_v{VER}.h5')","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T17:55:26.28897Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T17:55:26.289514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T17:55:31.121062Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T17:55:26.289469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T17:55:31.120313Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Validate Model - Infer OOF\nWe will now make predictions on the validation texts.
