It approaches the problems as a token classification problem (\"NER\"-like) and builds a RoBERTa base model with `max_length=512`. In order to do so, it manages the chunking with stride of the texts with length greater than 512 (and the posterior merge).**\n\nIt is a kind of follow-up of the public work, and relies heavily on the awesome public BigBird baseline by [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte): [PyTorch - BigBird - NER - [CV 0.615]](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/pytorch-bigbird-ner-cv-0-615). That notebook, in turn, uses code from the following ones:\n* [Fine-Tunned on Roberta-base as NER problem [0.533]](https://www.kaggle.com/raghavendrakotala/fine-tunned-on-roberta-base-as-ner-problem-0-533) by [RAGHAVENDRAKUTTALA](https://www.kaggle.com/raghavendrakotala)\n* [🎓 Student Writing Competition [Twitch Stream]](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/student-writing-competition-twitch) by [Rob Mulla](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/)\n* [Pytorch NER infer](https://www.kaggle.com/zzy990106/pytorch-ner-infer) by [zzy](https://www.kaggle.com/zzy990106)\n\nDon't forget to upvote all these excellent kernels.\n\n\n\n### This is the training notebook.\n### The inference notebook is here: [📖 PyTorch- \"ShortFormer\" w/Chunks - Infer [0.604]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/pytorch-roberta-w-chunks-infer-0-604)\n\n&nbsp;\nI loved the dual training/inference nature of Chris' notebook, but it was too much for me right now -I'm learning pytorch- so I unrolled it into the old Training/Inference way that we are used to. \n\n\nBoth mostly follow Chris'. The main differences are:\n1. At the tokenizing step, where I used the hugging face tokenizer functionality to leverage the chunking. See that step for details about the implementation\n2. Validation is now performed on a per-epoch fashion\n3. The `inference` and `get_predictions` functions had to be adapted to the chunking as well.\n\n\n\n# Please _DO_ upvote if you found this kernel useful or interesting! 🤗\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Oh, ($n^2$)oo!: Some context\n\n\nTransformer models are great. We all love them. _But_ the self-attention mechanism - the core of the Transformer architecture - has a matrix multiplication that scales quadratically with the input sequence length (at least) in terms of memory. The $QK^T$ costs a lot. And it makes the vanilla Transformer prohibitive for long sequences. This lead to the `512` tokens max length in the BERT-like models we see and use constantly.\n\nThere is research in the direction of reducing the cost of the attention operation so it scales in a slower fashion with the input length. Two recent models from this research are [LongFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) and [BigBird](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062), both put on the table by Chris Deotte in this competition (at least for me). \nThose models propose both slight variations of the self-attention mechanism that reduce the memory dependency to $O(n)$, this is, to scale linearly with the length of the input sequences. Both methods are \"sparse attention\" methods, meaning that, instead of each token attending to (and receiving attention from) all of the others, this cross-attention is pruned to a small number of tokens. In Longformer, there are 2 flavors of local windows (normal and dilated) and a global per-task attention, while in BigBird there is a window, a random and a global attention.\n\n\n   <center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/t4MYmbj.png\" width=\"50%\"></center>\n      <center><i>From the LongFormer <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150\">paper</a></i></center>\n\n\n   <center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4bkL2JA.png\" width=\"50%\"></center>\n      <center><i>From the BigBird <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062\">paper</a></i></center>\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nThe lower cost of these sparse self-attention mechanisms allows these models to handle up to `4096` in a normal GPU, this is, `8x` what a normal Transformer can.\n\nGiven the lengths of the texts in this competition, it is no surprise that the current public work is focused on those so called \"Longformer\" models and it is probable that they will be an important part of the final ensemble solutions.\n\nBut... but..., on the other hand, the old-fashioned 512-token models _do have_ a mechanism to cope with their sequence length limitations. For a given sequence of length greater than `512`, before longformer-like models, the NLP community would:\n\n1. Split it into chunks of `512` tokens (possibly with some overlap)\n2. Use the model to process those chunks\n3. Merge back the predictions over the chunks to obtain predictions over the full text\n\nThis mechanism was used, for example, during the recently finished [ChaII competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering), starting from [Darek Kłeczek](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat)'s [baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat/chaii-eda-baseline).\n\n\nIt is possible that this mechanism is still relevant although the sparse-attention models.\n\nIt is possible that [\"ShortFormers\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/discussion/297461) have something to say in this competition? Maybe add some variance to an ensemble? ... Or even more?\n\n\n---\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOk, let's go!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport gc\nimport ast\nimport time\nimport wandb\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification\n\nos.environ['TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM'] = 'false'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-30T04:26:07.404915Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-30T04:26:07.405707Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.153342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-30T04:26:07.405613Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.152551Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Configuration","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This is used to download the model from the huggingface hub\nMODEL_NAME = 'roberta-large'\n\nMODEL_CHECKPOINT = \"../input/feedback-prize-pytorch-robertalarge-itpt/roberta_large-itpt-e0\"\n\n# Path where to download the model\nMODEL_PATH = 'model'\n\nRUN_NAME = f\"{MODEL_NAME}-itpt-e1\"\n\n# Max length for the tokenization and the model\n# For BERT-like models it's 512 in general\nMAX_LENGTH = 512\n\n# The overlapping tokens when chunking the texts\n# Possibly a power of 2 would have been better\n# Tried with 386 and didn't improve\nDOC_STRIDE = 128\n\n# Training configuration\n# 5 epochs with different learning rates (inherited from Chris')\n# Haven't tried variations yet\nconfig = {'train_batch_size': 4,\n          'valid_batch_size': 2,\n          'epochs': 5,\n          'learning_rates': [2.5e-5, 2.5e-5, 2.5e-6, 2.5e-6, 2.5e-7],\n          'max_grad_norm': 10,\n          'device': 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu',\n          'model_name': MODEL_NAME,\n          'max_length': MAX_LENGTH,\n          'doc_stride': DOC_STRIDE,\n          }","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.154971Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.155209Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.203686Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.155175Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-30T04:26:15.203045Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# WANDB","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n    user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\n    api_key = user_secrets.get_secret(\"wandb_api\")\n    wandb.login(key=api_key)\n    wandb.init(project=\"feedback-prize\", entity=\"dataista\", name=RUN_NAME, config=config)\nexcept:\n    print('If you want to use your W&B account, go to Add-ons -> Secrets and provide your W&B access token.

Some single words consist of multiple subword tokens. In the code below, we use a word's first subword token prediction as the label for the entire word. We can try other approaches, like averaging all subword predictions or taking `B` labels before `I` labels etc.\n\nMoreover, since there are a large overlaps, for long texts there will be more than one prediction for various token. In this version, we are using the first prediction found and dropping all the rest.
