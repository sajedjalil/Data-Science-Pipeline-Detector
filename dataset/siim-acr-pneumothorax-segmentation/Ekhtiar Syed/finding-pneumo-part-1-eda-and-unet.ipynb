{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this competition is to identify \"Pneumothorax\" or a collapsed lung from chest x-rays. Pneumothorax is a condition that is responsible for making people suddenly gasp for air, and feel helplessly breathless for no apparent reason. Pneumothorax is visually diagnosed by radiologist, and even for a professional with years of experience; it is difficult to confirm. Neural networks and advanced data science techniques can hopefully help capture all the latent features and detect pneumothorax consistently.\n\nSo ultimately, we want to develop a model to identify and segment pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographic images.\n\n**I feel that this is an important competition, with potential of making a huge amount of impact, and we (the Kaggle community) should give it our best shot. The lines of python codes we write staying up a few nights and sacrificing a few leisure activity can help save someone's life one day.**\n\nTherefore, I wanted to create a Kernel that lowers the barrier to enter this competition. For those who are new, I will try to add as much explanation in the comment section as possible. For those who has very little time outside their professional and personal responsibilities, I hope this serves you a quick gateway to get started.\n\n#### Credits\n\nI very often see plagiarism in Kaggle community. I really find it difficult to understand why as \"a candle loses nothing by lighting another candle\". We should always credit original authors and upvote their work before using it. Below is the list of great Kernels I had the good fortune of taking help from while building this Kernel:\n\n* [Chest xray, DICOM, viz, U-nets](https://www.kaggle.com/jesperdramsch/intro-chest-xray-dicom-viz-u-nets-full-data) by [Jesper](https://www.kaggle.com/jesperdramsch)\n* [Full Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/seesee/full-dataset) by [See--](https://www.kaggle.com/seesee)\n* [Keras Data Generator 1024x1024 (unet)](https://www.kaggle.com/ppepijn/keras-data-generator-1024x1024-unet) by [pepijn](https://www.kaggle.com/ppepijn)\n* [EDA Can you see the Pneumothorax?](https://www.kaggle.com/freeman89/eda-can-you-see-the-pneumothorax) by [Kostadinov](https://www.kaggle.com/freeman89)\n* [Image Pre-processing for Chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/seriousran/image-pre-processing-for-chest-x-ray) by [Chanran Kim\n](https://www.kaggle.com/seriousran)\n\n\n#### PS: I am still working on this competition, but in a different Kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/ekhtiar/finding-pneumo-part-2-resunet.

However, we are allowed to download the data and upload it for the sake of this competition. To help us all out, this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/seesee/full-dataset) uploads the full dataset. I forked this kernel to have a quick start.\n\nAfter you download the dataset, it is important to understand the hierarchy or folder structure of the images. We have images seperated in a test and train folder. Python has a great utility library called *glob*, which makes pealing these oninion like file structures effortless. \n\nWithin these folders, for every dataset, we have two more folders encapsulating it. The data itself is in a format called DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine), which is the international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process, and display medical imaging information. This format can store these images with metadata (patient id, age, sex, etc.) in one file with .dcm extension.
