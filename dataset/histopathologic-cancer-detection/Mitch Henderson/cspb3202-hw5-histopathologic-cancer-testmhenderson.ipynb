This will happen when we call `datasets` on the `DataBlock`. At this point it will generate `DataSets` given the input dataframe and the specification in `DataBlock`.\n\nSince the input to `datasets` is a generic dataframe, `DataBlock` must also be given hints as to what part of the dataframe to use for the data and what part to use for the label. This is accomplished by two auxiliary functions `get_items` and `get_y`.

We can do that by taking the max probability from these two predictions and assign the class to the `argmax` of these two predictions. Note in the code below `axis-1` corresponds to the second dimension in the tensor, which is 2 in our case, that is, for every element in the test set we will take the argmax for the prediction possibilities.\n\nThen we create a pandas DataFrame with columns labeled as 'id' and 'label', with the stem of the filenames in the first column and the classes from the argmax in the second column. And we save the DataFrame to a file called 'submission.csv' for Kaggle.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_stem = [x.stem for x in test_files]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T14:51:26.13493Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T14:51:26.135748Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T14:51:26.223322Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-10T14:51:26.135706Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-10T14:51:26.22249Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_classes = np.argmax(test_preds[0], axis=1)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T14:51:27.572354Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T14:51:27.572607Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T14:51:27.59083Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-10T14:51:27.572578Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-10T14:51:27.589858Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"my_submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test_stem, 'label' : test_classes})\nmy_submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T14:54:55.914053Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T14:54:55.914754Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T14:54:56.094421Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-10T14:54:55.914717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-10T14:54:56.093628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!ls","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T14:55:21.540656Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T14:55:21.541146Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T14:55:22.302368Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-10T14:55:21.541107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-10T14:55:22.301473Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ","metadata":{}}]}
