If the mean of a time-series increases over time, then it’s not stationary. \n\nThe mean across many time periods is only informative if the expected value is the same across those time periods. If these population parameters can vary, what are we really estimating by taking an average across time?\n\nStationarity requires that the statistical properties must be the same across time, making the sample average a reasonable way to estimate them.\n\n<b> Methods to Check Stationarity </b>\n\n1. <b>Plotting rolling statistics:</b> Plotting rolling means and variances is a first good way to visually inspect our series. If the rolling statistics exhibit a clear trend (upwards or downwards) and show varying variance (increasing or decreasing amplitude), then you might conclude that the series is very likely not to be stationary.\n\n\n\n2. <b>Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test:</b> This test is used to assess whether or not a time-series is stationary. It gives a result called a “test-statistic”, based on which you can say, with different levels (or percentage) of confidence, if the time-series is stationary or not. The <b>test statistic</b> is expected to be negative; therefore, it has to be more <b>negative(less)</b> than the <b>critical value</b> for the <b>hypothesis to be rejected</b> and conclude that <b>series is stationary</b>.\n\n\n\n3. <b> ACF and PACF plots: </b> An autocorrelation (ACF) plot represents the autocorrelation of the series with lags of itself. A partial autocorrelation (PACF) plot represents the amount of correlation between a series and a lag of itself that is not explained by correlations at all lower-order lags. \nIdeally, we want no correlation between the series and lags of itself.
