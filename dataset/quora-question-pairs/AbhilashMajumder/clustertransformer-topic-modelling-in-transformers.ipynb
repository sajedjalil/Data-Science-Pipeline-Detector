The consequent loss is determined using cosine similarity after passing the corpus extracts through the forward pass of a generic Transformer module. The cosine metric is chosen as the main metric before applying agglomerative clustering strategies, based on similarity of neighborhood contexts. The library uses pytorch as the framework for the forward pass (dense feed forward network) construction of the embedding tensors.\n\n<img src=\"https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hugging-face.png?w=1200&strip=all\">\n\n\n\n\n## Working Demo\n\n\nIn this case, the Quora question pair similarity dataset is taken as the problem statement and instead of using the straightforward way, the Cluster transformer can be applied on a mixed set of the corpus. Instead of testing similarity based on row entries (i.e, question1 and question2), we will first merge all the questions and then try to create the clusters by passing them through the library. Semi supervised embedding weights created fromt the Transformer models can be used to map to the unsupervised clusters in this process. In a way, this is similar to zero shot classification on numeric labels. Since the classification of the clusters entirely depend on the neighborhood of cosine distance/similarity of an embedding eigen vector with respect to the others , the clusters may change for successive iterations.However the contextul similarity should prevail on a larger scale.\n\nThe steps to operate this library is as follows:\n\n- Initialise the class: ClusterTransformer()\n- Provide the input list of sentences: In this case, the quora similar questions dataframe\n   has been taken for experimental purposes. \n- Declare hyperparameters: \n    - batch_size: Batch size for running model inference\n    - max_seq_length: Maximum sequence length for transformer to enable truncation\n    - convert_to_numpy: If  enabled will return the embeddings in numpy ,else will keep in torch.Tensor\n    - normalize_embeddings:If set to True will enable normalization of embeddings.\n    - neighborhood_min_size:This is used for neighborhood_detection method and determines the minimum number of entries in                             each cluster\n    - cutoff_threshold:This is used for neighborhood_detection method and determines the cutoff cosine similarity score to                        cluster the embeddings.\n    - kmeans_max_iter: Hyperparameter for kmeans_detection method signifying nnumber of iterations for convergence.\n    - kmeans_random_state:Hyperparameter for kmeans_detection method signifying random initial state.\n    - kmeans_no_cluster:Hyperparameter for kmeans_detection method signifying number of cluster.    \n    - model_name:Transformer model name ,any transformer from Huggingface pretrained library\n    \n-  Call the methods:\n    -  ClusterTransfomer.model_inference: For creating the embeddings by running inference through \n       any Transformer library (BERT,Albert,Roberta,Distilbert etc.)Returns a torch.Tensor containing\n       the embeddings.\n    -  ClusterTransformer.neighborhood_detection: For agglomerative clustering from the embeddings created from the \n        model_inference method.Returns a dictionary.\n    -  ClusterTransformer.kmeans_detection:For Kmeans clustering from the embeddings created from the \n        model_inference method.Returns a dictionary.\n    - ClusterTransformer.convert_to_df: Converts the dictionary from the neighborhood_detection/kmeans_detection methods in                          a dataframe\n    - ClusterTransformer.plot_cluster:Used for simple plotting of the clusters for each text topic.\n\n\nThe above mentioned steps are used in this kernel and the effect of different transformers are shown for comparison purposes."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/17/47/1511265525-justice-league-poster.jpg?resize=480:*\">"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data=pd.read_csv('../input/quora-question-pairs/train.csv.zip')\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Merge the data into a unified list\n\nHere we merge the data to provide an input list to the library without any prior context as to which question pair should be evaluated with which question pair.

The graph in this case is strictly non increasing.In the above example,a min size of 3 items per cluster with a similarity score of 0.95 produces 2 clusters (denoted by the purple- label 0 containing 5 items and yellow - label 1 containing 3 items)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## DistilBERT Model\n\n\nThe distilbert performs better than Bert in most cases owing to continuous feedback of attention weights from the teacher to the student network. Where the weights change by a large extent in case of Bert, this fails to happen in DistilBert.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/groundai-web-prod/media%2Fusers%2Fuser_14%2Fproject_391208%2Fimages%2FKD_figures%2Ftransformer_distillation.png\">\n\n\nDistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT’s performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark. 2 significant benchmarks aspects of this Model:\n\n- Quantization :This leads to approximation of internal weight vectors to a numerically smaller precision\n- Weights Pruning: Removing some connections from the network.\n\nKnowledge distillation (sometimes also referred to as teacher-student learning) is a compression technique in which a small model is trained to reproduce the behavior of a larger model (or an ensemble of models). It was introduced by Bucila et al. and generalized by Hinton et al. a few years later. We will follow the latter method.Rather than training with a cross-entropy over the hard targets (one-hot encoding of the gold class), we transfer the knowledge from the teacher to the student with a cross-entropy over the soft targets (probabilities of the teacher). Our training loss thus becomes:\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/311/1*GZkQPjKC_Wqx1F4Uu3FdiQ.png\">\n\nThis loss is a richer training signal since a single example enforces much more constraint than a single hard target.\nTo further expose the mass of the distribution over the classes, Hinton et al. introduce a softmax-temperature:\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/291/1*BaVyKMXRWaudFvcI9So8MQ.png\">\n\nWhen T → 0, the distribution becomes a Kronecker (and is equivalent to the one-hot target vector), when T →+∞, it becomes a uniform distribution. The same temperature parameter is applied both to the student and the teacher at training time, further revealing more signals for each training example. At inference, T is set to 1 and recover the standard Softmax.\n\n\nSome resources:\n\n- [Blog](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5)\n- [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)\n- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nn_df,k_df=compute_topics('distilbert-base-uncased')\nkg_df=k_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nng_df=n_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,5))\nrng = np.random.RandomState(0)\ns=1000*rng.rand(len(kg_df['Text']))\ns1=1000*rng.rand(len(ng_df['Text']))\nax1.scatter(kg_df['Cluster'],kg_df['Text'],s=s,c=kg_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_title('Kmeans clustering')\nax1.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax1.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nax2.scatter(ng_df['Cluster'],ng_df['Text'],s=s1,c=ng_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax2.set_title('Agglomerative clustering')\nax2.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax2.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Agglomerative method\nn_df.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Kmeans method\nk_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## XLM Roberta/Roberta\n\n\n[XLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf) builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.\n\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f5c0d05eb0635cdd0e17e137265af23fa825b1d4/68747470733a2f2f646c2e666261697075626c696366696c65732e636f6d2f584c4d2f786c6d5f6669677572652e6a7067\">Tips:\n\n\nThis implementation is the same as BertModel with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup for Roberta pretrained models.\n\nRoBERTa has the same architecture as BERT, but uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer (same as GPT-2) and uses a different pretraining scheme.\n\nRoBERTa doesn’t have token_type_ids, you don’t need to indicate which token belongs to which segment.

is a lightweight bert which introduces parameter sharing, caching, and intermediate repeated splitting of the embedding matrix for efficient modelling tasks.\n\nAccording to the paper:\n\n\n'The first one is a factorized embedding parameterization. By decomposing\nthe large vocabulary embedding matrix into two small matrices, we separate the size of the hidden\nlayers from the size of vocabulary embedding. This separation makes it easier to grow the hidden\nsize without significantly increasing the parameter size of the vocabulary embeddings. The second\ntechnique is cross-layer parameter sharing. This technique prevents the parameter from growing\nwith the depth of the network. Both techniques significantly reduce the number of parameters for\nBERT without seriously hurting performance, thus improving parameter-efficiency. An ALBERT\nconfiguration similar to BERT-large has 18x fewer parameters and can be trained about 1.7x faster.\nThe parameter reduction techniques also act as a form of regularization that stabilizes the training\nand helps with generalization.\nTo further improve the performance of ALBERT, we also introduce a self-supervised loss for\nsentence-order prediction (SOP). SOP primary focuses on inter-sentence coherence and is designed\nto address the ineffectiveness (Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) of the next sentence prediction\n(NSP) loss proposed in the original BERT.'\n\n\nResources:\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/google-research/albert)\n- [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/albert.html)\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nn_df,k_df=compute_topics('albert-base-v1')\nkg_df=k_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nng_df=n_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,5))\nrng = np.random.RandomState(0)\ns=1000*rng.rand(len(kg_df['Text']))\ns1=1000*rng.rand(len(ng_df['Text']))\nax1.scatter(kg_df['Cluster'],kg_df['Text'],s=s,c=kg_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_title('Kmeans clustering')\nax1.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax1.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nax2.scatter(ng_df['Cluster'],ng_df['Text'],s=s1,c=ng_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax2.set_title('Agglomerative clustering')\nax2.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax2.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Agglomerative method\nn_df.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Kmeans method\nk_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## BART Model\n\n[This](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) is alternate SOTA model to denoise sentence2 sentence pretraining for natural language generation,comprehension etc. The most important points can be summarized as:\n\n\n- Bart uses a standard seq2seq/machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT).\n\n- The pretraining task involves randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token.\n\n- BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE.\n\nThe architecture contains these encoder -decoder modules :\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3138/1*Qss9gtS1nw_sgcG1pMAM2A.png\">\n\n<img src=\"https://miseciara.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/bart.gif\">\n\n\nSome resources:\n- [Blog](https://medium.com/dair-ai/bart-are-all-pretraining-techniques-created-equal-e869a490042e)\n- [Blog-BART](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/revealing-bart-a-denoising-objective-for-pretraining-c6e8f8009564)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nn_df,k_df=compute_topics('facebook/bart-large')\nkg_df=k_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nng_df=n_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,5))\nrng = np.random.RandomState(0)\ns=1000*rng.rand(len(kg_df['Text']))\ns1=1000*rng.rand(len(ng_df['Text']))\nax1.scatter(kg_df['Cluster'],kg_df['Text'],s=s,c=kg_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_title('Kmeans clustering')\nax1.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax1.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nax2.scatter(ng_df['Cluster'],ng_df['Text'],s=s1,c=ng_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax2.set_title('Agglomerative clustering')\nax2.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax2.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Agglomerative method\nn_df.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Kmeans method\nk_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Longformer\n\n\nThe Longformer model was presented in Longformer: [The Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05150.pdf) by Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, Arman Cohan.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\n\nTransformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer’s attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA.\n\nTips:\n\nSince the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn’t have token_type_ids. You don’t need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token tokenizer.sep_token (or </s>).\n\n- [Repository](https://github.com/allenai/longformer)\n\n\n<img src=\"https://t-dab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/alex-300x269.png\">"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nn_df,k_df=compute_topics('allenai/longformer-base-4096')\nkg_df=k_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nng_df=n_df.groupby('Cluster').agg({'Text':'count'}).reset_index()\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,5))\nrng = np.random.RandomState(0)\ns=1000*rng.rand(len(kg_df['Text']))\ns1=1000*rng.rand(len(ng_df['Text']))\nax1.scatter(kg_df['Cluster'],kg_df['Text'],s=s,c=kg_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_title('Kmeans clustering')\nax1.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax1.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nax2.scatter(ng_df['Cluster'],ng_df['Text'],s=s1,c=ng_df['Cluster'],alpha=0.3)\nax2.set_title('Agglomerative clustering')\nax2.set_xlabel('No of clusters')\nax2.set_ylabel('No of topics')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Agglomerative method\nn_df.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataframe Clustered with Kmeans method\nk_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Using with other Transformers\n\nThis library can be used with other variants of Transformers, present in this [link](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html).
