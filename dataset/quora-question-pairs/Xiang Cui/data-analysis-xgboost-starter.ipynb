Here, our goal is to identify which questions asked on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), a quasi-forum website with over 100 million visitors a month, are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful, for example, to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not, and submitting a binary prediction against the logloss metric.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to discuss competitions/hardware/games/anything with other Kagglers, then join the KaggleNoobs Slack channel [here](https://goo.gl/gGWFXe).
