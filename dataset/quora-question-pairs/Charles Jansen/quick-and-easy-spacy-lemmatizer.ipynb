In this notebook and the next I will try to give back a little bit to the community by sharing some examples.\n\nSpacy is a great tool and there is already some pretty detailed kernel on it. Yet I didn't find them easy to understand for someone new to spacy. My intend here is to make it as clear and direct as possible.\n\nI don't use stemmers because I feel we lose to much data. \nMy initial goal was actually to find something that would make the question more similar to Chinese. For the basis I have in Chinese one would say: I eat, he eat, yesterday he eat, tomorrow they eat, etc. The verb do not change and yet we perfectly understand the meaning of the sentence. The lemmatizer offered with spacy gave me a very similar result and added some perks (ex: removing plurals)\n\nAnd as Anokas says: \"**if this helped you, some upvotes would be very much appreciated - that's where I get my motivation! :D**\""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0c880440-2d83-07f8-6dfb-c992fadebd7c"},"outputs":[],"source":"#!pip install spacy"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"724ade6a-5d98-84f9-d59b-568650c1b2e9"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load('en')\n\ndef lemmatizer(text):        \n    sent = []\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    for word in doc:\n        sent.append(word.lemma_)\n    return \" \".join(sent)\n\nTEST_DATA_FILE  = '../input/test.csv'\n\ndataTest = pd.read_csv(TEST_DATA_FILE, sep=',', encoding='utf-8')\ndataTest['question1'] = dataTest['question1'].fillna(\"empty\")\nprint(\"lemma spacyQ1_test\")\ndataTest[\"spacyQ1_test\"] =  dataTest.apply(lambda x: lemmatizer(x['question1']), axis=1)\n\ndataTest['question2'] = dataTest['question2'].fillna(\"empty\")\nprint(\"lemma spacyQ2_test\")\ndataTest[\"spacyQ2_test\"] =  dataTest.apply(lambda x: lemmatizer(x['question2']), axis=1)\n\ndataTest['question1'] = dataTest[\"spacyQ1_test\"]\ndataTest['question2'] = dataTest[\"spacyQ2_test\"]\n\ndataTest = dataTest.drop(['spacyQ1_test', 'spacyQ2_test'], axis=1)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7fa3b947-b87e-5183-1a81-ba2503d4350c"},"source":"So, without spacy in this notebook I can't directly display data, but here are some output from this code on the training set, question1.\n\n## Outputs\n\n    what be the step by step guide to invest in share market in india ?\n    what be the story of kohinoor ( koh - i - noor ) diamond ?\n    how can -PRON- increase the speed of -PRON- internet connection while use a vpn ?\n    why be -PRON- mentally very lonely ?
