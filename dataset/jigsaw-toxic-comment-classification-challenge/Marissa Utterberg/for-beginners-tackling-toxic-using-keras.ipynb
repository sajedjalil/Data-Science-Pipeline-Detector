The time saved could have spent on fruitful tasks like experimenting with different variations of model, etc. However, I find that many variables and processes have been initialized automatically in a way that beginners to deep learning might not realize what is going on under the hood. There's a lot of intricate details so I encourage newbies to open up this black box and you will be rewarded with a wealth of knowledge in deep learning.\n\nI hope someone will find this short guide useful.
