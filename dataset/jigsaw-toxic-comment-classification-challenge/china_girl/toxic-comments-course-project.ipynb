The comments had been hand-labelled with respect to different kinds of toxicity. Six binary labels were used:\n* toxic\n* severe toxic\n* obscene\n* threat\n* insult\n* identity hate.\nAs we can see, the labels are quite different from each other, ranging from very specific types of toxicity (threat, obscenity) to sort of \"generic\" toxicity (first & second label).\n\nThis is __not__ a simple single-label classification task. Each comment may belong to __more than one__ category. Of course, most of the comments are labelled 0 for all categories, i.e. they are not toxic. This problem is discussed in Section 1 of this notebook.\n\nFor each comment in the test set, the model is expected to predict probability for each of the six types of toxicity specified above. Submissions are scored using the __mean column-wise ROC AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve)__. In other words, the final score is the average of ROC AUC scores for each category.\n\nAs usual with Kaggle competitions, the final score is calculated on a larger dataset called the \"private\" test set; during the competition, submissions are only scored against a small fraction of the private set (this promotes more generalisable models). When developing my solution, I was using only the public (small) test set; I checked private (i.e. ranking-relevant) test set score only in the end, after selecting the final model. The whole work is therefore done fully in accordance with Kaggle competition rules.\n\n---\n### Solution Overview\nIn general, the solution is a deep recurrent network. Although this is a Kaggle competition, I chose not to use any form of blending/ensembling but to build and tune a single model only.\n\nThe network was trained on a single Nvidia GPU (16 GB) hosted remotely on [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) (per-hour charge). I was using a 13$ free credit for students; this allowed only for limited experimentation, so possibly the model could be further improved if the computational resources were available."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8001e07ef3eb2e86afa4909fa6bf171e42372f82"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n### 0.

This model's performance on the advanced tasks like tagging or parsing is actually irrelevant, as I'm using only tokenization+lemmatization, which is of decent quality.\n\nIt is important to mention that SpaCy can automatically deal with abbreviations like \"I'd\", \"he'll\" and the like. That is why such patterns are not present in the replacement dictionary.\n\nThe whole preprocessing is contained within the clean_text() function defined below. It takes as input a single comment string and performs the following steps:\n* lowercase all words in the comment;\n* use regular expressions to apply the substitutions defined in the replacement dictionary;\n* tokenize the result;\n* lemmatize the result;\n* remove stopwords (I used the list of English stopwords available as part of [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/));\n* return all remaining tokens joined in a single string.\n\nThis function is applied both to the training and test set.\n\nWARNING: __do not__ run the cleaning procedure (unless you want to check if it works).

It has the following components:\n* Non-trainable Embedding layer (using Fasttext vectors for embedding as explained above). Trainable vectors tend to overfit terribly (the dataset is too small and also somehow prone to overfitting), so I decided not to unfreeze the embeddings.\n* Spatial dropout (rate 0.5) is applied to the embeddings. Spatial dropout cuts off entire feature maps along a dimension, which in the case of our model means that some positions on every vector are randomly \"switched off\" (the usual dropout way) from batch to batch during training. As every dropout layer, this has a regularizing effect. Adding the spatial dropout layer right after the embeddings turned out to make one of the biggest improvements in model's score.\n* Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation. The idea of including this layer is to provide a substitute to trainable vectors (the network can learn to \"preprocess\" the embedding layer if necessary).\n* Batch normalization and dropout (rate 0.5). All dense layers in the model are followed by the commonly used pattern of batchnorm+dropout. The first one normalizes the preceding layer's activations using current batch's mean and variance; this usually effects in learning speedup, decreases model's sensitivity to initial (randomly initialized) weight values and to possible differences between training/test feature distributions, allows for adding more layers (basically makes the layers more independent in a way) and has a small regularizing effect. Dropout is a standard regularization technique. I'm using quite high dropout rate (established empirically) because it's really easy to overfit on this dataset even for much sipler models than the final one.\n* After that, the main trick is applied: the model splits into two separate branches. Along the first branch, an LSTM layer with 64 units is applied (it's bidirectional, i.e. goes through the input both right-to-left and left-to-right). Th LSTM's output is then convolved with 128 filters of size 3 (in the 1D case, this means a moving \"horizontal\" window of length 3) with stride 1. The convolution's padding is valid, which means that the input dimension is reduced, not artificially kept as it was by use of padding. As usual, after the convolution comes a pooling layer; in this case, both max and average pooling is applied.\n* The left branch is similar, but it uses a greater (128) number of simpler GRU units instead of LSTM and less (64 instead of 128) convolutional filters.\n* After that, the branches are concatenated together; one more trick is to use both the results of max and average pooling over each branch, simply stacked into one long tensor. This allows the network to extract as much information about the input's properties as possible. Details of this approach will be described during the class presentation.\n* The concatenated results of pooling are then fed to another dense layer of 128 units with ReLU activation followed by batchnorm and 0.5 dropout. This allows the network to extract necessary features from the tensor obtained from pooling.\n* Finally, a simple 6-unit sigmoid-activated dense layer predicts the inputs.\nThe network uses an Adam (Adaptive learning rate with momentum) optimizer with initial learning rate of 0.001. One important thing is that gradient clipping is added to the optimizer. It helps to deal with the so-called exploding gradient problem, which is a common issue in recurrent networks and also empirically proved to be an issue in this particular task. Clipping the values, not the gradient norm, turned out to work a bit better.\n---\nThe schematic picture of the model (created with Keras built-in plot_model() function) looks as follows:\n\n![model](../models/final-model.png)"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"78237ddb18e24573c73f7c48243fdd7b83dadca6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def build_model():\n    model_input = Input(shape=(MAX_COMMENT_LEN,))\n    X = Embedding(input_dim=MAX_FEATURES, output_dim=EMB_SIZE_FASTTEXT, weights=[emb_matrix_fasttext], trainable=False)(model_input)\n    X = SpatialDropout1D(rate=0.5)(X)\n    \n    X = Dense(units=128, activation=\"relu\")(X)\n    X = BatchNormalization()(X)\n    X = Dropout(rate=0.5)(X)\n    \n    Y = Bidirectional(CuDNNLSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True))(X)\n    Y = Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding=\"valid\")(Y)\n    maxpool2 = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(Y)\n    avgpool2 = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(Y)\n    \n    X = Bidirectional(CuDNNGRU(units=128, return_sequences=True))(X)\n    X = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding=\"valid\")(X)\n    maxpool = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(X)\n    avgpool = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(X)\n    \n    X = concatenate([avgpool, maxpool, avgpool2, maxpool2])\n    \n    X = Dense(units=128, activation=\"relu\")(X)\n    X = BatchNormalization()(X)\n    X = Dropout(rate=0.5)(X)\n    X = Dense(units=6, activation=\"sigmoid\")(X)\n\n    model = Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=X)\n    opt = Adam(lr=0.001, clipvalue=1.0)\n    model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n    return model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"51b2ec1e14cddaa7c753fea30fe7e1c0c2f2e9cd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I couldn't do crossvalidation (it would take too much time on the computer I had), so I used the standard train-validation-test approach.
