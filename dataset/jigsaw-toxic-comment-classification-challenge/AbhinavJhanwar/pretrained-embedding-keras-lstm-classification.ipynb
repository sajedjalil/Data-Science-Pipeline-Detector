We will compare the performance of models using these pretrained embeddings against the baseline model that doesn't use any pretrained embeddings in my previous kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavjhanwar/word-embedding-keras-lstm-classification).\n\n![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3e812fd164a08f5e4f195000fecf988f)\n\nPerhaps it's a good idea to briefly step in the world of word embeddings and see what's the difference between Word2Vec, GLOVE and Fasttext.\n\nEmbeddings generally represent geometrical encodings of words based on how frequently appear together in a text corpus. Various implementations of word embeddings described below differs in the way as how they are constructed.\n\n**Word2Vec**\n\nThe main idea behind it is that you train a model on the context on each word, so similar words will have similar numerical representations.\n\nJust like a normal feed-forward densely connected neural network(NN) where you have a set of independent variables and a target dependent variable that you are trying to predict, you first break your sentence into words(tokenize) and create a number of pairs of words, depending on the window size. So one of the combination could be a pair of words such as ('cat','purr'), where cat is the independent variable(X) and 'purr' is the target dependent variable(Y) we are aiming to predict.\n\nWe feed the 'cat' into the NN through an embedding layer initialized with random weights, and pass it through the softmax layer with ultimate aim of predicting 'purr'. The optimization method such as SGD minimize the loss function \"(target word | context words)\" which seeks to minimize the loss of predicting the target words given the context words. If we do this with enough epochs, the weights in the embedding layer would eventually represent the vocabulary of word vectors, which is the \"coordinates\" of the words in this geometric vector space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8VLFs2.png)\n\nThe above example assumes the skip-gram model. For the Continuous bag of words(CBOW), we would basically be predicting a word given the context. \n\n**GLOVE**\n\nGLOVE works similarly as Word2Vec. While you can see above that Word2Vec is a \"predictive\" model that predicts context given word, GLOVE learns by constructing a co-occurrence matrix (words X context) that basically count how frequently a word appears in a context. Since it's going to be a gigantic matrix, we factorize this matrix to achieve a lower-dimension representation. There's a lot of details that goes in GLOVE but that's the rough idea.\n\n**FastText**\n\nFastText is quite different from the above 2 embeddings. While Word2Vec and GLOVE treats each word as the smallest unit to train on, FastText uses n-gram characters as the smallest unit. For example, the word vector ,\"apple\", could be broken down into separate word vectors units as \"ap\",\"app\",\"ple\". The biggest benefit of using FastText is that it generate better word embeddings for rare words, or even words not seen during training because the n-gram character vectors are shared with other words. This is something that Word2Vec and GLOVE cannot achieve.\n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f14a7be5-a88d-4f4d-95f8-fcfcafa39bc0","_uuid":"c41191e2f86f00e8bdac86b3383b2d0bb43d247f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Different types of embeddings.\n\n* GoogleNews-vectors-negative300 - https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\n* glove.840B.300d - https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\n* paragram_300_sl999 - https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/106\n* wiki-news-300d-1M - https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's start off with the usual importing pandas, etc","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bbf5b274-f78a-49c9-b416-d510adb2b399","_uuid":"96724c148074572ca78eb67573b74bea3ea48266"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys, os, re, csv, codecs, numpy as np, pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Input, LSTM, Embedding, Dropout, Activation\nfrom keras.layers import CuDNNLSTM, CuDNNGRU\nfrom keras.layers import Bidirectional, GlobalMaxPool1D\nfrom keras.models import Model\n#from keras import initializers, regularizers, constraints, optimizers, layers\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport gensim.models.keyedvectors as word2vec\nimport pandas as pd\nimport gc","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b6103d10-10b9-44dd-8c7c-ce71bb390833","_uuid":"908cc6a5d46bae29f822e0dd353fd34947898706","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T15:20:58.463273Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T15:20:58.463682Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T15:21:05.133751Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-08T15:20:58.463587Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T15:21:05.132498Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some preprocessing steps that we have taken in my earlier kernel.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"38caf564-a3b9-455e-8764-be6af9fc9eb9","_uuid":"95f368df56588643270c781668fa0a51b183a7a5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv.zip')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test.csv.zip')\nembed_size=0","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"05c286a1-2510-4c38-8922-6f4d8dcad863","_uuid":"bead9ea1dfe1846027bfcd94a264a110b6f06e81","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T15:21:22.296541Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T15:21:22.297198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.261244Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-08T15:21:22.297154Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.259945Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"list_classes = [\"toxic\", \"severe_toxic\", \"obscene\", \"threat\", \"insult\", \"identity_hate\"]\ny = train[list_classes].values\nlist_sentences_train = train[\"comment_text\"]\nlist_sentences_test = test[\"comment_text\"]","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7e8ad169-36d2-4f13-8a6d-0b829451d6be","_uuid":"a410746ad2dd36a2b9719382e04431eee5d34c68","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.263558Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.263875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.283552Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.263831Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.282457Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"max_features = 20000\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_features)\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(list(list_sentences_train))\nlist_tokenized_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(list_sentences_train)\nlist_tokenized_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(list_sentences_test)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3d2dad9a-7ce2-42a7-be74-c737618294aa","_uuid":"a46ed61c7a46e6201d070531ab1794e998268c0e","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.285829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.286355Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T15:21:57.83288Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-08T15:21:26.286308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T15:21:57.831907Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"maxlen = 200\nX_t = pad_sequences(list_tokenized_train, maxlen=maxlen)\nX_te = pad_sequences(list_tokenized_test, maxlen=maxlen)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7d7a8d69-2ade-472b-8c6b-fdb6a916f24c","_uuid":"b9e0c623fb56fa637df7a9f0659d36f9c639ac51","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T15:21:57.836036Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T15:21:57.836266Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T15:22:01.096606Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-08T15:21:57.836235Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T15:22:01.095567Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since we are going to evaluate a few word embeddings, let's define a function so that we can run our experiment properly.
