Word2Vec gives the value of correlation between two words and formed a pre-trained matrix.\n\n### Word2Vec\nWord2Vec is a group of related models that are used to produce web embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic context of words. Word2Vec takes as input a large corpus and produces a vector space, of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in corpus being assigned a vector in space. Words are placed such that words having similar meaning in the corpus are located in close proximity to each other. The cosine of angle between vectors of words having similar context should be close to 1, i.e., angle close to 0.\n\nHere comes the idea of distributed representations. Intuitively, we introduce some dependence of one word on the other words. The words in context of the particular word would get a greater share of this dependence.\n\nWord2Vec can utilize either of the two model architectures to produce a distributed representation of words: continuous bag of words (CBOW) or continuous skip gram\n\n#### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\nThis method takes the context of each word as input and tries to predict the word corresponding to the context from a window of surrounding context words. The order of context words does not influence the predictions. We learn the vector representation of the target word.\n \nIn CBOW, the input given is the context word and we try to predict the center words so that the cosine between context word and center word approaches to one. The input layer is the one hot encoding of the context words. The input layer is then multiplied with hidden layer which is the weight matrix and as output we get word vector representation. This hidden input layer is then multiplied to the output layer, i.e., weight matrix W’ and then the output is fed to the softmax function which calculates the probabilities and the vector with highest probability is chosen to be the vector closest to the input context word.\n\nIn multiple context words, the vectors obtained in hidden input layer are averaged before going further.\n \n#### Skip gram\nSkip gram is just opposite to CBOW. In this algorithm, target word is fed as input to the network. It weighs the nearby context words more heavily than more distant context words. It learns by predicting the surrounding words given a target value.\n \nBoth models are focused on learning about words given their local usage context, where the context is defined by a window of neighboring words. Continuous bag of words is considered to be faster than skip gram but skip gram performs well for small data is found to represent rare words well. CBOW has better representation for more frequent words.\nWord2vec is implemented using Genism package.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model_cbow = Word2Vec(filtered_words)\nword_vectors = model_cbow.wv\nvocabulary = word_vectors.vocab.items()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model_cbow.most_similar('mother')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(word_vectors.vocab)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Handling of Unknown words","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"keys = list(word_vectors.vocab.keys())\nunk = 0\ntotal = 0\n\nembedding_matrix = word_vectors.vectors\n## Word with their index values\nword2id = {k:v.index for k,v in word_vectors.vocab.items()}\n\n## Unknown values\nUNK_INDEX = 0\nUNK_TOKEN = 'UNK'\nunk_vector = embedding_matrix.mean(0)\n\n## Inserting row for unknown words \nembedding_matrix = np.insert(embedding_matrix, [UNK_INDEX], [unk_vector], axis=0)\nword2id = {word:(index+1) if index >= UNK_INDEX else index for word, index in \n           word2id.items()}\nword2id[UNK_TOKEN] = UNK_INDEX\n\n## Replacing words in x_train with their respective indices and replacing each unknown \n## word with index 0\nL = []\nfor sent in filter_words:\n    Z = []\n    for word in sent:\n        if word in word2id:\n            Z.append(word2id.get(word))\n        else:\n            Z.append(UNK_INDEX)\n            unk+=1\n    L.append(Z)\nX_train = pad_sequences(L, maxlen=100, padding='post',\n                        dtype='float')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Implementing RNN using GRU/LSTM using Keras","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Implementing RNN using GRU/LSTM\nvocab_len = len(embedding_matrix)\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Embedding(vocab_len, 100, input_length = 100,weights=[embedding_matrix]))\nmodel.add(GRU(units=100, activation='tanh'))\n#model.add(LSTM(units=120, activation='tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.2))\nmodel.add(Dense(50,activation='tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dense(6,activation='softmax'))\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='binary_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.summary()\nmodel.fit(X_train,y,batch_size=1000,epochs=10)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Testing model on test data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nx_test = []\nfor sentence in X_test:\n    x_test.append(text_to_word_sequence(str(sentence),filters='!\"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~\\t\\n', lower=True, split=' '))\n\nfilter_test = []\nfor sent in x_test:\n    tokens = [w for w in sent if w not in Stopwords]\n    filter_test.append(tokens)\n\n## Converting the text into sequences using ids\nL = []\nfor sent in x_test:\n    Z = []\n    for word in sent:\n        if word in word2id and len(word)>2:\n            Z.append(word2id.get(word))\n        else:\n            Z.append(UNK_INDEX)\n            unk+=1\n    L.append(Z)\n\nX_test = pad_sequences(L, maxlen=100, padding= 'post',dtype='float')\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.evaluate(X_test,Y_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
