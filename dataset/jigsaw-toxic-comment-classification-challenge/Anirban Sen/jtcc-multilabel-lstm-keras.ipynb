Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0\"></a>\nIn earlier notebook(https://www.kaggle.com/anirbansen3027/jtcc-cnn) we used g Keras Library (which is a wrapper over tensorflow) for creating 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) for multi-label text classification on output variables - toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate.\n\nIn this one, we will be using the same Keras Library (which is a wrapper over tensorflow) for creating Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is an improvement over regular RNNs for multi-label text classification. We will be first going through a bit of intuition of how RNNs and LSTM work and then implement it using a minimalistic single output layer network for multilabel classification (instead of creating 6 separate networks for each type of toxicity or creating a multiple output layer network). We will be just using a single LSTM layer and in just a single epoch it gives ~96 AUC on leaderboard \n\n### Why do we need for RNNs?\nIn a traditional neural network we assume that all inputs (and outputs) are independent of each other. They dont share features learnt across different positions of text. This might be an issue for sequential information such as text data or time-series data where each instance is also dependent on the previous ones. RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being depended on the previous computations. Another way to think about RNNs is that they have a “memory” which captures information about what has been calculated so far. \n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FQyAYBP.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" width = 700/>\n\n### What is the architecture of RNNs?\nThe overall architecture of the RNN depends on the task in hand. For this task which is a classification task, we will be using the 3rd one: many-to-one. But for intuition purpose, let's look at the 5th one which is a more generalised notation for RNNs. If we know how the 5th notation work, it will be just a matter to change a small part.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/dldiy/slides/lecture_8/images/rnn_variants_4.png\" width = 500/>\nInput vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN's state (more on this soon). From left to right: (1) Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). (2) Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). (3) Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). (4) Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). (5) Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video)\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S7AKfYi.png\"/>\n\n### What is vanishing gradients?\nThe vanishing gradient problem arises in very deep Neural Networks, typically Recurrent Neural Networks, that use activation functions whose gradients tend to be small (in the range of 0 from 1). Because these small gradients are multiplied during backpropagation, they tend to “vanish” or reduce to 0 throughout the layers, preventing the network from learning long-range dependencies. As the sequence gets longer, the gradients/ derivatives passed to the previous states become smaller and smaller.There are many solutions to this problem. One of that is using LSTM.\n\n\n### What is an LSTM?\nLong Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.All RNNs have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. LSTMs also have this chain like structure, but instead of the hidden layer we have something called LSTM cell and we have another connection that runs through all the time steps along with the hidden state.This is the called the \"Cell State\" vector from which information can be retrieved and removed as and when required.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/utWg9yZ.png\"/></a>\n\nLet's look at the 6 steps:\n\n1. This is the forget gate which is responsible for how much to forget and since it passes through a sigmoid function, it will give a value of 0 to 1 which is the amount of memory to be retained.\n2. This is the input gate which is responsible for how much new information is to be added to the cell state. Similar to forget gate this will also give a value of 0 to 1 which is the amount of new memory to be added\n3. This is the creation of new candidate vector/ cell state \n4. This is where the cell state is updated which is a combination of previos cell state and current cell state, the contribution of each is controlled using the forget gate and input gate respectively.\n5. This is the output gate which is responsible for what part of the updated cell state is to be remembered in the hidden state having a value between 0 and 1\n6. This is the updated hidden state which will be the input for next cell and is based on cell state controlled by output gate \n\nThis is an awesome link to deep dive further into LSTM http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\n\n### How does LSTM solve vanishing gradients?\n* The LSTM architecture makes it easier for the RNN to preserve information over many timesteps e.g. if the forget gate is set to remember everything on every timestep, then the info in the cell is preserved indefinitely\n* By contrast, it’s harder for vanilla RNN to learn a recurrent weight matrix Wh that preserves info in hidden state\n* LSTM doesn’t guarantee that there is no vanishing/exploding gradient, but it does provide an easier way for the model to learn long-distance dependencies\n\nBefore the birth of Transformers, LSTMs ruled the world of NLP. Even today it is used in many places\n\n**2015:**\nGoogle started using an LSTM for speech recognition on Google Voice. According to the official blog post, the new model cut transcription errors by 49%.\n\n**2016:**\n2016: Google started using an LSTM to suggest messages in the Allo conversation app. In the same year, Google released the Google Neural Machine Translation system for Google Translate which used LSTMs to reduce translation errors by 60%.\n\nApple announced in its Worldwide Developers Conference that it would start using the LSTM for quicktype in the iPhone and for Siri.\n\nAmazon released Polly, which generates the voices behind Alexa, using a bidirectional LSTM for the text-to-speech technology.\n\n**2017:**\nFacebook performed some 4.5 billion automatic translations every day using long short-term memory networks.\n\nEnough of context, let's dive into the code 👨‍💻"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
