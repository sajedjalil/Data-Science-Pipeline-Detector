Concussions, fortunately, are rare events.  On over 6000 punts, there were 37 concussions.  With this type of data sparsity, it would be easy to see signals that are not there.  To address that problem, I took the following approach.\n\n* Clean and label the data -- This kernal analyzes concussion data from 2016 and 2017.  There were rule changes before the 2017 and 2018 season. I identify the concussions covered by the current rules and remove them from the analysis. This cleaning required detailed video analysis and review of the NFL rules. I used the NGS data to produce play diagrams and impact charts to help identify exactly where, when, and who were involved in the concussion. During this cleaning, I found and fixed multiple problems.  After this process, I had a root cause determined for each concussion.\n\n* Brainstorm a large list of possible rules -- Thinking about what rules are possible first allowed me to apply these possible rules to each of the videos and determined if a particular rule would prevent a particular concussions.  For instance if the problem was a blocking technique, there are multiple possible ways to prevent that technique.\n\n* Visualizations -- Bar charts make differences between small numbers seem more significant.   A difference between 2 and 4 concussions out of 6000 punts is completely insignificant but a bar char would make that 4 look twice as important as the 2.  For that reason, I have used tables when summarizing concussions.  When I used graphs, I focused on visualizations that represented all of the data instead of a summary.\n\n### Audience\nThere is a variety of people who hopefully will be reading this kernal. I tried to put enough data analysis to keep data scientists happy and enough domain knowledge for everyone else.  For those that want to skip the analytics, I have included a summary that highlights the key takeaways from each section\n\n\n### Rule Types\nA brief overview of rules that will be evaluated. This overview is deliberately brief. After analyzing the data, I will focus on a few rules. At that point,  more details will be provided.\n\n**Reduce Punts**\n* CFL Rouge/Single - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(football)\n* Fair Catch Bonus Yards - A fair catch is treated as a 5 or 10 yard return\n* Encourage teams to keep kicks out of play\n    * Out of Bounds Bonus Yards - Converse of previous rule. Out of bound punts are rewarded\n    * Reduce touchback distance\n* No Preseason Punts\n* Encourage going for it on 4th down - On missed FG's, keep ball at line of scrimmage\n\n\n**Make Punts Safer**\n* Formation (borrow from Kickoff Rules)\n    * Limit receiving team players outside the numbers\n    * Require same number of players on each side of the ball\n* Tackling\n    * Stricter targeting rules\n* Blocking\n    * No Wedge Blocks\n    * Expand Blindside block rules\n* Returner Protection\n    * Play calls dead early\n        * On muffed punts\n        * On fair catch\n    * CFL buffer rule\n    * Fair Catch even when ball bounces\n\n**Eliminate Punts**\n* Automatic Punt - Instead of punting, move the ball as if there was a 40 yard net punt.\n* Half Punt - If team fails on 4th down, treat it like a 20 yard net punt.\n\n### Integrity of the game\nRules can address three phases of the play:\n1. Before\n    * Formation rules, illegal player downfield\n    * Attempt to prevent bad situations from happening\n    * Impacts all plays to prevent bad plays\n2. During\n    * Blindside blocks, targeting, landing on the QB, CFL 5 yard buffer\n    * Target very specific behavior\n    * Biggest impact on both concussions and integrity of game.\n3. End\n    * Touchbacks, spot of the ball after missed field goal, CFL rouge\n    * Encourages players to avoid bad situations\n    * Selectively applied if player chooses it\n    \n    All other things being equal, a rule that is applied at the end of the play changes the game the least.\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dd49e94c47df9472a6e0cccb75e598c8d5f7fbcb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Data and Basic EDA"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-01-09T00:14:02.004484Z","start_time":"2019-01-09T00:13:59.816372Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"b055a1d2694473f5fe1399824cc7b6aca8725732","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport glob\nfrom plotly import offline\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\npd.set_option('max.columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)\noffline.init_notebook_mode()\nconfig = dict(showLink=False)\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom IPython.display import Image\n\n#Load provided files\nplay_information = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/play_information.csv')\nvideo_review = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/video_review.csv')\nvideo_footage_injury = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/video_footage-injury.csv')\nvideo_footage_control = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/video_footage-control.csv')\ngame_data = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/game_data.csv')\nplayer_jersey = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/player_punt_data.csv')\nplayer_role = pd.read_csv('../input/NFL-Punt-Analytics-Competition/play_player_role_data.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6d50cb9634781e2d80c8c0d305cbade6468ec968"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Parse information from play_information.csv\nPlay_information.csv has information on all punts for 2016-2017.\n\nThe play description column on play information has a wealth of information but required some basic text extractions.

For analysis, I converted these into yards from TD.\n\nFor yard metrics, I used the qcut feature that divided the total data into 5 equal groups - 0-20th percentile, 20-40th percentile, etc.  I combined that overall data with the concussion data to help see if concussions were more frequent in certain groups.  For instance, were there more concussions on the longest punts?  The benefit of this technique is that for every variable I get a simple 5 row table. At a quick glance, I can see if the rows are roughly equal or if one row has most of the concussions.  For instance if return yards were correlated with concussions, I would expect the 80th-100th percentile group to have the most concussions.

was integral to my video analyis.  This view included all the information I needed to review each of the videos.  It shows the time, speed, location, and participants for each concussion.  It also shows where everyone else on the field was during the play.\n\nBelow is an example of a play.  \n\n### Text\nThe first 4 lines of text give all the key information about the play. Included is the variables I flagged from the EDA above.\n\n### Play Diagram\nThe concussed player is identified in yellow.  The partner in green.  Red indicates coverage players, blue indicates punters.  Each dot is 0.1 seconds apart so dense lines indicate slowness and dotted lines indicate high speed.\n\n### Impact Graph\nFor the concussed player, the distance to all other players was calculated use x,y data. The change in that distance was then used as speed. The speed when distance crossed 0 was then used as the impact speed.  One side effect of this approach was that near misses and collisions were both recorded.  \n\nDistance Between Players: $ \\sqrt (X_1 - X_2)^2 + (Y_1-Y_2)^2) $\n\nSpeed:  $ (D_{t=2}-D_{t=1})/0.1 $\n\nImpact Speed: Speed when Distance = 0\n\nThe speed was converted to miles per hour to give a common frame of reference to the speed. As a quick refresher, 6 MPH is a 10 minute mile or a light jog.  10 MPH is a run or 6 minute mile.  15 MPH and above would be a sprint.  Because this speed measures the difference between two elite atheletes, there are values of 30 MPH or above.  That would occur when two players were running at full speed directly at each other. \n\nThe time on the x-axis is seconds and 0 is equal to line_set in the NGS data.  I used that value because aligned very closely with most of the videos.\n\n### Video\nThe URL and the video are provided so that video can be watched either in the notebook or on a second monitor.\n\n### Running the cell\nEach of the 37 plays could be called by giving the row number. I did this to make sure, I did not overlook any play.  In addition a for loop could then run all 37 plays. For submission, I did not run the loop because I did not want to overwhelm reviewers.

I was conservative and added calls that were obvious and preferrably were not in the official rules at the time.  On one play, I saw what appeared to be a missed illegal block. That block happened way before the punt returner received the ball.

Kickoff touchbacks were increased by 5 yards.  Kickoff starting points have moved multiple times in 5 yards increments.  In an attempt to decrease long field goal attempts, the ball was placed at the spot of the kick.  That rule was essentially an 8 yard \"penalty\" on missed field goals.\n\nAwarding 5 yards to discourage dangerous play is the exact kind of rule change that the NFL has done before.  The rule would also be transparent to the casual fan.  After a TV timeout, the ball would be advanced 5 yards from where the ball was caught.  \n\nCollege football has also paved the way for this rule change by allowing teams to fair catch kickoffs inside the 25 and award a touchback.  Likewise, this rule change would set a positive example for college and high school teams. Changes to improve NFL players' safety quickly get moved and expanded to other levels. If the NFL adopted 5 yards for a fair catch, it would not be suprising to see college or high school adopt 10 yards. \n\n### Limit Jammers\nFormation changes are also a popular technique to reduce concussions.  Limiting jammers would be consistent with recent kickoff rules.  It would be easy to referee.

Would any of these reactions result in more injuries.\nThere are 4 ways the rule may impact strategy\n1. Teams try to punt further to recover the 5 yards.  Longer punts are associated with longer returns, so receiving teams may end up returning the ball more often. In addition, receiving teams may use more jammers if they return more balls. Because receiving teams have an effective counter, I believe teams will not consistently go for long punts\n\n2. Teams go for the block more often.  If the returner is going to fair catch, send more players after the punt. Very few concussions were associated with blocking for the punt (3 of 37), so any increase in those concussions should be more tha offset with the decrease in concussions from increased fair catches.  In addition, teams could not go for an all out block without opening themselves up to a fake.\n\n3. Teams may punt out of bounds more often.  Today, kicking out of bounds is slightly worse than a fair catch.  With a 5 yard bonus, teams would be encourage to kick out of bounds. Taken to an extreme, this would remove the excitement of punt returns.  This rule should be evaluated in the preseason to determine if teams choose to always kick it out of bounds.  \n\n4. Pinning a team inside the 10 yard line would be more difficult.  The receiver can fair catch the ball at the 5 and get the ball at the 10.  Balls that land past the 5 yard line are more difficult to down.  Pinning punts are not a problem, so this rule unnecesarily makes them harder.  I resisted the temptation to make the rule more complicated to deal with this case."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4342f9b05c14231b2879ce8bc8dd98943fde34f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Reaction to Limit Jammers\nHow may kicking and receiving teams react to the new rule?  Would any of these reactions result in more injuries.\n\n* Limiting jammers would impact all punt plays.  It is more likely to have unforseen consequences.\n* With only 2 jammers, teams may use more front blockers.  Front blockers are rarely used right now, but they are associated with a higher rate of concussions.  A rule limiting jammers would also need to address the number of players near the line of scrimmage. \n* Punts are not distinct plays like kickoffs.  On punts, defenses need to protect against fake attempts.  Restrictions on the return punt formations might make defenses more vulnerable.  If a team lines up in a traditional punt formation, the rule is easy to enforce.  What happens if kicking teams explore different formations?  Would the receiving team be unable to counter them because of these rule changes?

Long tail of many other factors.\n\nGroup tackling is a fundamental part of football, and there were no obvious technique problems.  Any new rule needs to decrease the frequency of long returns. After reviewing 17 rules, there are two leading candidates. Limiting jammers and awarding bonus yards for fair catches both have pros and cons.  Because of data sparsity, it is unclear if the connection between jammers and concussion is real. It could easily be a correlation with long returns.  Because a limit on jammers would impact all punt players, it should not be implemented until the connection is clearer.  Awarding 5 yards for a fair catch is better because it will impact only a subset of punts.   It is also a simpler rule to officiate and can be easily adjusted in the future and at different levels.  \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a66a790aad1d5009c0ef77d14b8ba56d1f7dc8c2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"hide_input":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"toc":{"base_numbering":1,"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":false,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{"height":"calc(100% - 180px)","left":"10px","top":"150px","width":"384px"},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":true}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
