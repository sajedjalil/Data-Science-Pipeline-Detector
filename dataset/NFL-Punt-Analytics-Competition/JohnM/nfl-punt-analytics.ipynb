It is my opinion that based on the data provided, changing two rules for punt plays could result in up to 8 fewer concussions per year. The two proposed changes are as follows:\n\n  - *Move the ball forward 10 yards after a Fair Catch.* After fair catch of a scrimmage kick, play would start 10 yards forward from the spot of catch, or the succeeding spot after eforcement of penalties. This would apply when the receiving team elects to put the ball in play by a snap.\n\n  - *Penalize blindside blocks with forcible contact to any part of a defenseless player's body.*  Defenseless players as described by NFL rules include players receiving a blindside block from a blocker whose path is toward or parallel his own end line. Prohibited contact for punt plays would include blindside blocks with forcible contact to any part of a defenseless player's body, including below the neck.\n\nThe figure below shows the potential reduction in concussions based on 2016-2017 data and associated assumptions.\n<br>\n\n<span style=\"display:inline-block; margin-top:30px; margin-left:112px; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold\">Potential Reductions</span>\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/nonwebstorage/headstrong/redux.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:40px\"> \nMy analysis is thoroughly documented in the following sections:  </p>\n\n  - <a href='#bg'>Background</a>\n  - <a href='#mt'>Methodology</a>\n  - <a href='#an'>Analysis</a>\n  - <a href='#cn'>Conclusion</a>\n  - <a href='#tm'>Qualifications</a>\n  - <a href='#ap'>Appendix</a>\n\n  \nYou can find the complete code for preparing the attached data files in the following kernels and datasets:\n\n   - [NFL Data Preparation](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-data-preparation)\n   - [NFL Punt Play Animation](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-punt-play-animation)\n   - [NFL Concussion Data](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-competition-data)\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:40px\">\nThank you and happy reading!<br>\nJohn Miller<br>\nBenbrook Analytics</p>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f13772a6f3a9b6c1555c24a7da621b0eef414dba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='bg'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">  Background</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\">Since 1920 the National Football League has developed the model for a successful modern sports league.

The number tops basketaball(11%), baseball(9%) and soccer(7%) by a wide margin. </p>\n\nPlayer safety has always been a concern for football. Over the past few years, concussions sustained during play have become one of the most visible issues affecting players.

During the 2015-2017 seasons, the kickoff represented only six percent of plays but 12 percent of concussions, making the risk four times greater than running or passing plays. In response, the NFL revised its kicking rules for 2018 to reduce risk during kickoffs. \n\nThe NFL is now increasing the attention given to punt plays. According to NFL executive Jeff Miller, concussion risk during punts is twice that of running or passing plays. In response the NFL is sponsoring this competition as part of an overall effort to make punt plays safer.

For each situation I consider rules changes here in a general way. A detailed discussion and evaluation of recommendations appear later in the report.\n\n*Offensive linemen and gunners blocked downfield.* As the ball is snapped, gunners work to outmaneuver the jammers and get downfield. Within seconds the ball is punted and offensive linemen also run down field, ahead of the defensive line to tackle the punt returner. Offensive linemen and gunners are at risk as defensive players make their way over and back to protect the returner. Players are usually moving at a high rate of speed and focused on the returner, which amplifies the risk. Players are at risk downfield as long as the ball remains in play.\n\nI recommend expanding the current rule prohibiting illegal blindside blocks to include contact below the neck. 6 of the 10 downfield blocks leading to concussion occurred when an offensive player was moving toward the returner and got hit from the side or back. In at least 5 of these cases, the block occurred as a member of the receiving team moved toward or parallel to his own end line. However, contact is permitted below the neck and no penalties were assessed. \n\n   \n*Offensive linemen blocking at the line of scrimmage.* In punt plays, linebackers from the defense are often placed as linemen on the line of scrimmage. Their job is to aggressively rush the punter and block the punt. The offensive line often inlcudes tight ends and running backs with a job usually staffed by a much larger player. The offensive linemen are at risk during the first several seconds of every punt play.\n  \nI have no recommended rule change specifically related to concussions at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\n*Offensive linemen tackling returners.* Although a large proportion of concussions in 2016 and 2017 involved tackling, I have no additional recommendations at this time. The NFL added a rule for 2018 that brings a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent. The new rule may very well reduce concussions incurred when tackling.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e7c0aca44061ac459a5f9ef9ce2e5696b1c44b4c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"h3\"> Evaluating Proposed Changes </div>\n\nThere are many rules changes one can consider to reduce concussions associated with punts. A drastic but effective example would be to declare a dead ball wherever the punt lands, goes out of bounds, or is touched by the receiving team. Clearly this would change the nature of the punt play as we know it. I chose a more conservative approach that also took into account ease of implementation and preserving game integrity. The table below lists the potential rules changes I considered along with a summary evaluation.\n\n#### Evaluation Summary of Proposed Changes\n<table class=\"rules\">\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th><th>Reduces Concussions</th><th>Reduces Secondary Risks</th><th>Easy to Enforce</th>\n<th>Preserves Game Integrity</th>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td>10-yard forward spot after fair catch</td>\n<td>++++</td>\n<td>+++</td>\n<td>+++</td>\n<td>++</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Expand illegal blind-side blocks <br> to include contact below the neck</td>\n<td>++</td>\n<td>+++</td>\n<td>++</td>\n<td>+++</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"857b9692eb0b5abdaf6a70490cc216b345660ebb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The summary ratings above resulted from the following considerations.\n\n<b>Change 1. *Move the ball forward 10 yards after a Fair Catch.*</b> After fair catch of a scrimmage kick, play would start 10 yards forward from the spot of catch, or the succeeding spot after eforcement of penalties. This would apply when the receiving team elects to put the ball in play by a snap.\n\n   - Fair catches had a concussion rate 1/8 that of live returns. Increasing the incentive for a fair catch could reduce risk to both punt returners and offensive linemen downfield. Punt returners may not be as pressured to take a hit in situations where the most likely outcome is at best a 5-10 yard return. Also the play will end sooner which reduces risk to offensive linemen getting hit by defensive linemen running to block for the return. The rule would additionally reduce the risk of tackling which accounted for another 13 concussions, although the new Use of Helmet rule may have already had an impact there.   \n  \n   - Secondary effects should be positive. If the punting team wants to prevent a fair catch they have to kick the ball out of bounds or for a touchback if possible. Both of these outcomes are safer than live returns. \n    \n   - The rule is fairly easy to enforce. Officials already spot the ball after a fair catch according to the rules. With this change they would simply move the ball forward by 10 yards.\n    \n   - The rule would not present a large change to the game. 2/3 of all returned punts ended in a net gain of 10 yards or less so most returns would see no impact. From the fans' standpoint the change would amount to 2-3 more fair catches per game and possibly even more scoring as the receiving team gets better field position. A returner with room to run or exceptional talent could still run the ball and preserve the rare but exciting possibility of a long return. Also, punting strategies have evolved in recent years as leading punters come up with new ways to gain an advantage over the return team. This change could give them added incentive. \n  \n  \n<b>Change 2. *Expand illegal blindside blocks to include forcible contact below the blocked player's neck.*</b> Article 7 lists players in a defenseless posture who are protected from prohibitive contact. The list includes players receiving a blindside block from a blocker whose path is toward or parallel his own end line. However, prohibited contact does not include forcible contact below the neck as long as it is not with the helmet and the blocker does not illegally launch. I recommend expanding the definition of prohibited contact for punt plays to include forcible contact to any part of a player's body, provided he meets the criteria for a defenseless player.\n   \n   - Blindside blocks accounted for at least 5 concussions during the 2016-2017 seasons. In most cases an offensive lineman was maneuvering to intercept a returner and was hit by an approaching defensive lineman moving at a higher rate of speed.\n    \n   - Secondary effects on safety should be positive. Blindside blocks are dangerous even when they are legal.\n    \n   - The rule is relatively easy to enforce. There would need to be additional training for officials, coaches and players as with any rule change. There may be a challenge in seeing all possible fouls and calling penalties given the fast action and chaotic nature of the play.\n    \n   - Emphasis on the rule would generally preserve game integrity. A potential downside is that more penalties would be assessed, slowing down the game."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9b3c31442db72c6f28cc1020c2aec67d1b29c6a5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='cn'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">  Conclusion </div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\">In this report I presented my problem solving methodology, analysis, and recommendations.

The figure shows  punt plays with different characteristics. There are three groups separate from the main mass, appearing as \"islands\" of points above, right, and below the main mass of points.

Formations, the speed of players, and relative location will typically be different.\n\nPlays in which a concussion occurred are shown in orange.

In this case the dots are found across the map, including within the separated island areas. \n\n<span class=\"note\">Hover over points to see play descriptions.</span>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"433ae101b694b84514913e5ce640838161004101","_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x_dist = ngs.x - ngs.x.shift(-1), ngs.y - ngs.y.shift(-1)\nngs['speed'] = 10*np.hypot(ngs.x - ngs.x.shift(-1), ngs.y - ngs.y.shift(-1))\n\n# get player-level agg\naggdict_player = {'Time': ['size'],\n                  'x': ['mean', 'max', 'min', 'var'],\n                  'y': ['mean', 'max', 'min', 'var'],\n                  'speed': ['mean', 'max']}\nngs_agg = ngs.groupby(['GameKey', 'PlayID', 'GSISID']).agg(aggdict_player)\nngs_agg.columns = [n[0] + '_' + n[1] for n in ngs_agg.columns]\nngs_agg\n\n\n# get play-level agg\naggdict_play = {'x_mean': ['mean', 'var'],\n                'x_max': ['max', 'var'],\n               'x_min': ['min'],\n                'x_var': ['max', 'mean'],\n                'y_mean': ['mean', 'var'],\n                'y_max': ['max', 'var'],\n               'y_min': ['min'],\n                'y_var': ['max', 'mean'],\n                'speed_mean': ['mean', 'var'],\n                'speed_max': ['max', 'var']}\nngs_agg = ngs_agg.groupby(['GameKey', 'PlayID']).agg(aggdict_play)\nngs_agg.columns = [n[0] + '_' + n[1] for n in ngs_agg.columns]\n\nplays_all['points_ahead'] = np.where(plays_all.Poss_Team == \n        plays_all.HomeTeamCode, plays_all.home_score - plays_all.visit_score,\n        plays_all.visit_score - plays_all.home_score)\n\nplay_cols = ['Type_dlineman_agg',\n             'Type_fullback_agg',\n             'Type_gunner_agg',\n             'Type_jammer_agg',\n             'Type_linebacker_agg',\n             'Type_olineman_agg',\n             'Type_protector_agg',\n             'Type_punter_agg', \n             'dist_togoal',\n             'concussion',\n             'yardage',\n             'points_ahead',\n             'PlayDescription']\n\nplays_strategy = plays_all[play_cols]\n\nngs_agg2 =  ngs_agg.join(plays_strategy, how=\"inner\").replace(-99, -1)\nngs_agg2['yardage'] = pd.to_numeric(ngs_agg2.yardage)\n\ntargets = ngs_agg2[['concussion', 'PlayDescription']]\nngs_agg2.drop(['concussion', 'PlayDescription'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\nngs_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(ngs_agg2.fillna(0).values)\n\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=30.0, verbose=1, \n        learning_rate=50, random_state=222)\n\nngs_emb = tsne.fit_transform(ngs_scaled)\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a0f98352d455dd818b5de80bfe6ddf8775c1edfb","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"strategy = pd.DataFrame(ngs_emb, columns=['x', 'y'])\nstrat_annotated = pd.concat([strategy, ngs_agg2.reset_index(), targets.reset_index(drop=True)], axis=1)\n\nno_conc = strat_annotated[strat_annotated.concussion == 0].hvplot.scatter('x', 'y', \n                     alpha=0.4, size=5, grid=True, hover_cols=['PlayDescription'], \n                     height=550, width=700)\nyes_conc = strat_annotated[strat_annotated.concussion == 1].hvplot.scatter('x', 'y', \n                     hover_cols=['PlayDescription'], size=30)\nno_conc*yes_conc","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4cd9f4f7dc70873405d37da238689192eaec3426"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I concluded that based on the factors listed above, there was nothing about specific punt strategies that seemed to make one type of punt play noticably more dangerous than another.
