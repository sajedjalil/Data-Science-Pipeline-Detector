It is my opinion that based on the data provided, changing two rules for punt plays could result in up to 8 fewer concussions per year. The two proposed changes are as follows:\n\n  - *Putting the Ball in Play after a Fair Catch.* After fair catch of a scrimmage kick, play would start 10 yards forward from the spot of catch, or the succeeding spot after eforcement of penalties. This would apply when the receiving team elects to put the ball in play by a snap.\n\n  - *Prohibiting contact of defenseless players.* Prohibited contact for punt plays would include forcible contact to any part of a player's body, including below the neck, provided he meets the criteria for a defenseless player. Article 7 lists players in a defenseless posture who are protected from prohibitive contact. The list includes players receiving a blindside block from a blocker whose path is toward or parallel his own end line. \n\nThe figure below shows the potential reduction in concussions based on 2016-2017 data and associated assumptions.\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/nonwebstorage/headstrong/redux.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:40px\"> \nMy analysis is thoroughly documented in the following sections:  </p>\n\n  - <a href='#bg'>Background</a>\n  - <a href='#mt'>Methodology</a>\n  - <a href='#an'>Analysis</a>\n  - <a href='#cn'>Conclusion</a>\n  - <a href='#tm'>Qualifications</a>\n  - <a href='#ap'>Appendix</a>\n\n  \nYou can find the complete code for preparing the attached data files in the following kernels and datasets:\n\n   - [NFL Data Preparation](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-data-preparation)\n   - [NFL Punt Play Animation](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-punt-play-animation)\n   - [NFL Concussion Data](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/nfl-competition-data)\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:40px\">\nThank you and happy reading!<br>\nJohn Miller<br>\nBenbrook Analytics</p>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f13772a6f3a9b6c1555c24a7da621b0eef414dba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='bg'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">  Background </div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\">Since 1920 the National Football League has developed the model for a successful modern sports league.

The number tops basketaball(11%), baseball(9%) and soccer(7%) by a wide margin. </p>\n\nPlayer safety has always been a concern for football. Over the past few years, concussions sustained during play have become one of the most visible issues affecting players.

During the 2015-2017 seasons, the kickoff represented only six percent of plays but 12 percent of concussions, making the risk four times greater than running or passing plays. In response, the NFL revised its kicking rules for 2018 to reduce risk during kickoffs. \n\nThe NFL is now increasing the attention given to punt plays. According to NFL executive Jeff Miller, concussion risk during punts is twice that of running or passing plays. In response the NFL is sponsoring this competition as part of an overall effort to make punt plays safer. The goal of the competition is to discover specific rule modifications, supported by data, that may reduce the occurrence of concussions during punt plays."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f3a11f01cd03eeddb934903117c44078fc69bdd3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='mt'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">  Methodology </div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\">I followed a rigorous methodology designed to help solve problems like the one posed in this challenge.

The NFL added a rule for 2018 that brings a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent. It is likely that the new rule will reduce concussions incurred when tackling.\n\nFor blocks, I synthesized the various blocking situations into scenarios with high potential for harm. For each situation I recommend any rules changes in a general way. A detailed discussion and evaluation of the recommendations appear later in the report.\n\n*Offensive linemen and gunners blocked downfield.* As the ball is snapped, gunners work to outmaneuver the jammers and get downfield. Within seconds the ball is punted and offensive linemen also run down field, ahead of the defensive line to tackle the punt returner. Offensive linemen and gunners are at risk as defensive players make their way over and back to protect the returner. Players are usually moving at a high rate of speed and focused on the returner, which amplifies the risk. Players are at risk downfield as long as the ball remains in play.\n\nRecommend expanding the current rule prohibiting illegal blindside blocks to include contact below the neck. 6 of the 10 downfield blocks leading to concussion occurred when an offensive player was moving toward the returner and got hit from the side or back. In at least 5 of these cases, the block occurred as a member of the receiving team moved toward or parallel to his own end line. However, contact is permitted below the neck and no penalties were assessed. \n\n\n   \n*Offensive linemen blocking at the line of scrimmage.* In punt plays, linebackers from the defense are often placed as linemen on the line of scrimmage. Their job is to aggressively rush the punter and block the punt. The offensive line consists of linebackers, tight ends, and running backs with a job usually staffed by a much larger player. The offensive linemen are at risk during the first several seconds of every punt play.\n  \nNo recommended rule change specifically related to concussions at the line of scrimmage.\n\nThe above recommendation is discussed in more detail later in the report."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c40d9d885f77c27b278590ca7dadf3b45ea4bd6d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"h4\"><span style=\"color:#DD0000\"> Opportunity Area 3. </span> Safer play strategies.</div>\n\nFor this opportunity I looked at the data to see how concussion incidents correlated to the play strategies followed by teams. Special teams strategies have many layers and elements. I focused on the relatively few elements where we had data. I captured the following factors:\n\n  - Distance from scrimmage line to goal\n  - Score difference  \n  - Formation of each team at line-up\n  - Location of players on the field during the play\n  - Player speeds\n  - Punt distance\n\nI relied heavily on NGS data for this part of the analysis. The NGS data for 2016 and 2017 includes the specific postion of each player during the play at intervals of 0.1 seconds, as well as his direction of travel and orientaton.

This would apply when the receiving team elects to put the ball in play by a snap.\n\n   - Fair catches had a concussion rate 1/8 that of live returns. Increasing the incentive for a fair catch could reduce risk to both punt returners and offensive linemen downfield. Punt returners may not be as pressured to take a hit in situations where the most likely outcome is at best a 5-10 yard return. Also the play will end sooner which reduces risk to offensive linemen getting hit by defensive linemen running to block for the return. The rule would additionally reduce the risk of tackling which accounted for another 13 concussions, although the new Use of Helmet rule may have already had an impact there.   \n  \n   - Secondary effects should be positive. If the punting team wants to prevent a fair catch they have to kick the ball out of bounds or for a touchback if possible. Both of these outcomes are safer than live returns. \n    \n   - The rule is fairly easy to enforce. Officials already spot the ball after a fair catch according to the rules. With this change they would simply move the ball forward by 10 yards.\n    \n   - The rule would not present a large change to the game. 2/3 of all returned punts ended in a net gain of 10 yards or less so most returns would see no impact. From the fans' standpoint the change would amount to 2-3 more fair catches per game and possibly even more scoring as the receiving team gets better field position. A returner with room to run or exceptional talent could still run the ball and preserve the rare but exciting possibility of a long return. Also, punting strategies have evolved in recent years as leading punters come up with new ways to gain an advantage over the return team. This change could give them added incentive. \n  \n  \n<b>Change 2. *Expand illegal blindside blocks to include forcible contact below the blocked player's neck.*</b> Article 7 lists players in a defenseless posture who are protected from prohibitive contact. The list includes players receiving a blindside block from a blocker whose path is toward or parallel his own end line. However, prohibited contact does not include forcible contact below the neck as long as it is not with the helmet and the blocker does not illegally launch. We recommend expanding the definition of prohibited contact for punt plays to include forcible contact to any part of a player's body, provide he meets the criteria for a defenseless player.\n   \n   - Blindside blocks accounted for at least 5 concussions during the 2016-2017 seasons. In most cases an offensive lineman was maneuvering to intercept a returner and was hit by an approaching defensive lineman moving at a higher rate of speed.\n    \n   - Secondary effects on safety should be positive. Blindside blocks are dangerous even when they are legal.\n    \n   - The rule is relatively easy to enforce. There would need to be additional training for officials, coaches and players as with any rule change. There may be a challenge in seeing all possible fouls and calling penalties given the fast action and chaotic nature of the play.\n    \n   - Emphasis on the rule would generally preserve game integrity. A potential downside is that more penalties would be assessed, slowing down the game."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9b3c31442db72c6f28cc1020c2aec67d1b29c6a5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='cn'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">  Conclusion </div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\">In this report I presented my problem solving methodology, analysis, and recommendations.

This represents a 40% decrease in concussions from punt plays. The changes would improve player safety, be relatively easy to enforce, and have minimal impact to overall game integrity.</p>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c460a4cff4b195ba72a91f7b8270823dde16ce63"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='tm'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\"> Qualifications </div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px\"> I work as Principal Data Scientist at Benbrook Analytics, helping companies use data to make better decisions.
