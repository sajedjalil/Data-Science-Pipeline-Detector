Among the most common are 'Offensive Holding' and 'Illegal Block Above the Waist'.\n\n#### Offensive Holding:\n\n\n#### Illegal Block Above the Waist:\nThe [Illegal Block Above the Waist](http://insidethepylon.com/football-101/glossary-football-101/2016/09/28/itp-glossary-illegal-block-back/) is defined as:\n> An illegal block in the back penalty (officially known as illegal block above the waist) is called when a player makes contact with an opposing player, who does not have the ball, above the waist from behind. A block in the back penalty costs the team (generally on offense or receiving a kick / punt) ten yards from the spot of the foul.\n\nSuch offense is common because:\n1. The Coverage team runs straight to the PR\n2. The PR is behind the Return team. The Return team must turn around.\nBy the time the PR team turns around, they would be behind the Coverage team, who just ran past their defense.\n\nOther terms such as Offensive Holding is defined in the [NFL Rulebook](https://operations.nfl.com/media/2646/2017-playing-rules.pdf).\n\n#### Interference Rule:\nThe interesting rule to note is the Interference rule. It protects the player from getting tackled while he is distracted watching out for the ball. It is an essential rule in a Punt Play because the PR is a dedicated player to catch a kicked ball. The downfall of the rule, however, is the immediate removal of safety once the ball is caught (unless he declared a safe catch). This does not give the PR sufficient time to adjust to his surroundings.\n\nLet us check if penalties and injuries have some relationship."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"03e8895c9e6161a71b7519bca1295b86324a99e1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Penalty Injuries:\n\n### How many punt play injuries have a corresponding Penalty?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"59c95ee2d699e6a876383803f14fdb60287481c6","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_injury_plays = df_injury.merge(df_play_info, \n                                  left_on=['GameKey', 'PlayID'],\n                                 right_on=['GameKey', 'PlayID'],\n                                 how='left')\ndf_injury_plays['Penalty'] = df_injury_plays.apply(lambda row: get_penalty(row), axis=1)\ndf_injury_penalty = df_injury_plays[df_injury_plays['Penalty']=='Yes']\nprint('Penalty count: ' + str(len(df_injury_penalty)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6fc9491a00d4f1022546fbdd69200e84fcaddcf5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In 10 out of 37 injuries, there are already existing rules for some injury incidences.

The rule is intentionally created to protect the receiver as he diverts his attention from the players and  focuses on catching the ball. However, there are some limitations to the rule. The player cannot be tackled while the ball is on the air, but once it touches his hands, the other protection is immediately removed.

Blocking Form\n\n> Based on the analysis on Game Mechanics, most of the coverage formation blocking injuries (before the kick) are helmet-to-helmet collisions. In the initial phase of the play, the opponents are facing each other as the blocking occurs. However, the blocking forms may have an influence in the impact type.\n    ![Wrestling](http://www.animatedimages.org/data/media/164/animated-american-football-image-0015.gif)\nThe Greco-Roman wrestling form best illustrates the form used in blocking defense. This form, however, naturally exposes the head to injuries. In one of the blocking injuries, there were two defenders who accidentally bumped into each other as they were double-teaming on an opponent.  In the 0:02 mark of the video, we can all the heads of the people involved are leaned forward. This seems to be the case in most blocking or blocked injuries even in one-to-one face-offs.\nSince the concussion rates from such wrestling forms are beyond the given dataset, I will just refer to the following articles:\n- [Wrestling’s the most dangerous sport for concussions](https://www.athleticscholarships.net/concussion-wrestling-football-college.htm)\n- [Studies shine harsh light on wrestling's concussion rate, impact on athletes](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-wrestling-concussions-met-20160110-story.html)\n- [Control The Head: Combating Concussions In Wrestling](https://woub.org/2014/04/14/control-head-combating-concussions-wrestling/)\n\n2 Running Form\n>Based on the analysis on Game Mechanics, most of the gunner's injuries are helmet-to-helmet collisions. In the Collision Pairs analysis, the gunner's injuries occured on high speeds of more than 20kph  (in 4/5 injuries).\n![Running](http://www.animatedimages.org/data/media/164/animated-american-football-image-0071.gif)\nThe standard running form has some forward lead that exposes the head. When people are running, they both expose their heads to anyone in front of them. Again, the appropriate field of study for this is kinematics.\n\nIdentification of which forms cause more injuries would require consolidation with non-punt related injuries."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fdb66d2a158b070c49b5a046351c3d52aade2600"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Season Types\n### What is the ratio of injuries per season?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"502e2be37703c961452d76d9e936ee65ce1049c6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_total = df_play_info['Season_Type'].value_counts().reset_index(name='total')\ndf_injury_total = df_injury_plays['Season_Type'].value_counts().reset_index(name='injured')\n\n# df_total.head()\ndf_merged = df_total.merge(df_injury_total, how='right')\ndf_merged = df_merged.fillna(0)\ndf_merged['ratio'] = 100*df_merged['injured'] / df_merged['total']\ndf_merged['ratio_safe'] = 100-df_merged['injured']\n\nsns.barplot(x='ratio', y='index', \n#             order=df_merged['ratio'].value_counts().index,\n            data=df_merged)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bf6552db649b51c5bd84778f93ce276faa6d89b5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There is a proportionally higher injury rate during the pre-season than in the regular season.
