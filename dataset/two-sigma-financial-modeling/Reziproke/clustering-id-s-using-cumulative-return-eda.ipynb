Check it out :). Here we build on that and try to gain additional insights about the id's (financial instruments) in the data and perform some clustering. The main idea is to look at the cumulative returns of each id and see how it correlates to other id's. That will allow us to cluster these in an easy way and see of th. \n\n The last plot gives the main result (scroll to the end).\n\n##Caution! Important!\n\n*The analysis changed somewhat to see if the result is not a statistical fluke. Let's assume we have lots of randomly generated curves (e.g. cumulative return) and we look at their correlations. Then we might find a subset of curves that are highly correlated and go up and about the same number of curves that are highly correlated and go down. The end result might look like what we got here. To see if the findings are for real the clustering is now performed up to the timestamp 900, ignoring everything that happens after that. The result is presented for all timestamps up to 1812. The new interpretation: **There are probably no clusters with respect to the cumulative returns** (at least not with the methodology used here) as the upward and downward trend of the clusters suddenly levels of after the timestamp 900 (in the old analysis these trends continued).*\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sankhamukherjee/two-sigma-financial-modeling/when-why-are-stocks-bought-and-sold"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4971c52c-9218-19f6-24b8-7614d1ce89ba"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"543ca436-e7f6-b103-4e01-68b280207405"},"outputs":[],"source":"data = pd.read_hdf(\"../input/train.h5\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c02cf9da-c5bb-5778-944e-55875a70c1fa"},"source":"We will calculate correlations between all the id's but to ensure that we have enough overlap we only look at those id's that have more than 450 timestamps (i.e. at least 50% of data available).\nAdditionally, we will later only keep id's that are generally highly correlated with other id's.
