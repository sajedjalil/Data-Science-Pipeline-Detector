Any comment/help is welcome :)]\n\nWatching you guy's kernel and trying to play myself with the data, I noticed that there is a high number of missing values. \n\nWhat I am trying to do here is to check if the assumption that ids in the dataset correspond to the same type of financial securities holds. The idea behind this is that certain variables does not make sense for different securities.\n\nFor instance, it would make no sense for an equity security to have an interest rate (putting aside preferred shares). Even for securities that \"looks\" the same, you may have differences. Assuming that \"fundamental\" variables correspond to data concerning the issuer, calculating the GDP of a corporate bond issuer makes no sense, and governments do not have a US-GAAP/IFRS P&L. \n\nThat being said, I would like to see if I can create clusters of ids solely based on the appearance of certain variables.\n\nLet's try!\n\n# Conclusion so Far\n\n- Using a very naive approach confirmed that clustering according missing values could potentially yield interesting results\n- A heatmap confirmed the previous result and suggested that about 5 clusters would be sufficient\n- Using the silouhette score as a metric suggest that 8 clusters would be optimal\n- When plotting the distribution of y for each cluster, we recover the Gaussian shape present in the original data\n\n# Work in Process\n\nNow that I found a way to create clusters, my goal is to assess these clusters.\n\n# Getting Data\n\nFirst, let's import some libraries and retrieve the data.","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"af111f25-6fee-7d64-ca6b-4f1ed4c7790d","_active":false},"outputs":[],"source":"#Importing libraries\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Getting data\n\n#I owe this to SRK's work here:\n#https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/two-sigma-financial-modeling/simple-exploration-notebook/notebook\nwith pd.HDFStore(\"../input/train.h5\", \"r\") as train:\n    df = train.get(\"train\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"78210fbc-9bfc-1a02-b25b-cc32da19bdd2","_active":false},"source":"I will create some variables that might be useful later.","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"64064c6f-405f-13bc-97e7-5eea819673a6","_active":false},"outputs":[],"source":"input_variables = [x for x in df.columns.values if x not in ['id','y','timestamp']]\n\nprint(\"Number of predicting variables: {0}\".format(len(input_variables)))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"02363500-b67b-f11c-02d3-a22a4d793e1e","_active":false},"source":"# A Naive Implementation\n\nMy first try will be rather simple:\n\n 1.
