So please bear with me and I am happy to receive any kind of feedback.\n\nSince the training data set (and possibly the test data as well) contain missing data, I wanted to have a closer look at this issue. I have seen that other participants propose to fill those NaNs with the mean or median for the respective column. Here I am not (yet) that much interested in filling the blanks but I rather want to know whether we can learn something more about the data when looking missing values."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d5bcf820-9d2c-bea2-b7a4-91e85c56710e"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e0df9bdd-06ec-f2a3-e2f3-908a3b3d413f"},"outputs":[],"source":"with pd.HDFStore('../input/train.h5') as train:\n    df = train.get('train')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f54578d0-9bb1-5d35-fac1-94e8c0396f43"},"source":"Let's see how much data we've got:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c0a44ce6-4316-6ae3-b7e7-65e6eae29657"},"outputs":[],"source":"print(df.shape)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aeef373d-af3e-47b2-9498-1c3bcffc477f"},"source":"That's quite a few column.

For a given ID and feature column either <30% of the data is missing or all of it. The large gap in between renders the mean values a bit misleading. But what it is interesting to me is the fact that the standard deviation varies quite a bit. For fundamental and derived data the variations among different IDs seem to be (in general) larger than for the technical feature columns. One reason could be that fundamental data could be missing for fixed number of time stamps (e.g. the first N occurences) which would lead to large variations since time spans for which different IDs are present vary quite a bit as other participants already revealed. In order to test this, we can make the same plot for the absolute number of missing values per feature column."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"93c20330-4878-f4cf-77d3-11e604a81fa3"},"outputs":[],"source":"counts = nan_df.xs('count',level='stat',axis=1)\ncount_mean = counts.mean()\ncount_std = counts.std()\nplt.figure(figsize=(16,8))\nplt.xticks(np.arange(len(count_mean)),count_mean.index,rotation='vertical')\nplt.errorbar(np.arange(len(count_mean)),count_mean,yerr=count_std,fmt='o')\nplt.ylabel('mean for number of missing data')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1892b277-b97c-9fa1-3aa2-3279c7d1024d"},"outputs":[],"source":"plt.hist(counts.values.flatten(),bins=50)\nplt.xlabel('counts of rows with missing data per ID');"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3af6695e-4bab-472e-0768-3cb0a1e8270e"},"source":"Nope, the picture remains the same.
