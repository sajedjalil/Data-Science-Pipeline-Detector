On the one hand, a few features have the highest absolute correlation without beeing lagged (e.g. technical_30). On the other hand, most features have a very low correlation in the initial unlagged setting but a higher correlation if they are beeing lagged. Often times, the correlations are positive for one asset and negative for the other asset. However, my guess is that the optimal lag can be calculated based on the absolute correlation.
