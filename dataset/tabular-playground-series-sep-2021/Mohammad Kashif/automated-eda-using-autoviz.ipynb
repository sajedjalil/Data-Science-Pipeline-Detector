Otherwise, fill in the file                  name and leave dfte as empty string. Only one of these two is needed to load the data set.\n* **'sep'**- this is the separator in the file. It can be comma, semi-colon or tab or any value that you see in your file that          separates each column.\n* **'depVar'**- target variable in your dataset. You can leave it as empty string if you don't have a target variable in your             data.\n* **'dfte'**- this is the input dataframe in case you want to load a pandas dataframe to plot charts. In that case, leave               filename as an empty string.\n* **'header'**-  the row number of the header row in your file. If it is the first row, then this must be zero.\n* **'verbose'**- it has 3 acceptable values: 0, 1 or 2. With zero, you get all charts but limited info. With 1 you get all                  charts and more info. With 2, you will not see any charts but they will be quietly generated and save in your              local current directory under the AutoViz_Plots directory which will be created. Make sure you delete this                folder periodically, otherwise, you will have lots of charts saved here if you used verbose=2 option a lot.\n* **'lowess'**- this option is very nice for small datasets where you can see regression lines for each pair of continuous                 variable against the target variable. Don't use this for large data sets (that is over 100,000 rows).\n* **'chart_format'**- this can be SVG, PNG or JPG. You will get charts generated and saved in this format if you used                           verbose=2 option. Very useful for generating charts and using them later.\n* **'max_row_analyzed'**- limits the max number of rows that is used to display charts. If you have a very large data set with                       millions of rows, then use this option to limit the amount of time it takes to generate charts. We                         will take a statistically valid sample.\n* **'max_cols_analyzed'**- limits the number of continuous vars that can be analyzed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"filename = \"../input/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021/train.csv\"\nsep = \",\"\ndft = AV.AutoViz(\n    filename,\n    sep=\",\",\n    depVar=\"claim\",\n    dfte=None,\n    header=0,\n    verbose=0,\n    lowess=False,\n    chart_format=\"svg\",\n    max_rows_analyzed=150000,\n    max_cols_analyzed=30,\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***But I highly recommend you to use conventional way of doing exploratory data analysis.***","metadata":{}}]}
