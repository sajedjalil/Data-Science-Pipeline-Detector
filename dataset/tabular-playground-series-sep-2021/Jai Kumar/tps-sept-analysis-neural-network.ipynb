For numerical data, two most suitable imputation techniques that could be used here are *mean imputation* and *median imputation*. I will try both these techniques and compare their performance on the validation set. In the final notebook, you will only see the technique which performed better.

Standardization can become skewed or biased if the input variable contains outlier values.\n\nTo overcome this, the median and interquartile range can be used when standardizing numerical input variables, generally referred to as robust scaling.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler, StandardScaler\n\nrobust_scaler = RobustScaler()\nrobust_scaler.fit(X_train_imputed)\nX_train_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_train_imputed)\nX_valid_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_valid_imputed)\nX_test_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_test_imputed)\n\nstandard_scaler = StandardScaler()\nstandard_scaler.fit(X_train_imputed)\nX_train_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_train_imputed)\nX_valid_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_valid_imputed)\nX_test_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_test_imputed)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T08:10:45.457178Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T08:10:45.457416Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T08:10:53.501259Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T08:10:45.45739Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T08:10:53.500364Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On passing through the Scalers, our Data Frame has now been converted to a numpy array.

structure was decided upon after training different structures on the train set and analyzing the performances. Most of the times, this back & forth process of defining a structure then evaluating performance is an integral part of training a neural network.\n\n- **Dropout:** Dropout leaves out some nodes (or activation units) from the previous layer. Dropout is random, i.e. differnt nodes will be shut off for different iterations. Doing this introduces some noise into the current layer evaluations and thus, it helps to preven overfitting of the training set.\n- Applying *BatchNormalization()* to every layer helps by harmonizing the different features to a common scale of values.
