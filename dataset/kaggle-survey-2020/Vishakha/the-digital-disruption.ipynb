How is this relevant in today's world? Is this relevant to me, does it affect me?\n\nI hope you have this plethora of questions in your mind  when you read this heading? In today's world, each industry is heading towards digital. Everything is going online, EVERYBODY is going ONLINE. This massive shift in the work paradigm and meeting of what was earlier business in silos and using Digital Technology is what is called Digital Transformation. The current Covid Pandemic has accelerated this shift at pace no one imagined before. Who would have thought that Elementary Schools would have to turn Digital? \n\nHow is this Disruptive? Let's take the example of Netflix or Uber. Who would have thought that brick and mortar business models, based on people buying their favorite DVDs from a local shop, or going to a car rental company, days in advance to your planned trip could be totally replaced?? With something that I cannot see, I haven't personally discussed and negotiated; yet so **EASY**!!\n\nThis easy is the key word. In today's world, we need everything fast, easy and yet which provides value to us. As a result, each company, every business is trying to imbibe and leverage Digital to provide more value to their customers. This shift has opened newer avenues for people, who are exploring different  programming languages, different technologies, learning and exploring. It's crucial to LEARN and EVOLVE to survive today and what challenges coming years  are going to throw at us. Resilience and adaptation to change has become a key metrics for success in any field.\n\nThrough this analysis, we will try to explore how the various people who responded to the survey this year are preparing themselves for this upcoming war of survival. Through several graphs, we will try to explore what is the distribution of people across age groups, profession groups etc. and what are the preferences. We will try to gauge what are the technologies to watch for, what are the things one need to arm themselves with to stay relevant. This is our own journey to equip ourselves with right tools and technologies for this disruptive digital transformation which has entered [Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider)  growth phase and whether we like it or not we need to embrace this **impact**.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/how-your-business-can-succeed-digital-transformation-projects-1024x440.jpeg)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"maindata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"questions = maindata.iloc[0, :].T\ndata = maindata.iloc[1:, :]\ndata[\"id\"] = data.index \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Bridging the Gender Gap!!\n\nData Science; and programming in general was assumed to be a Man's  world.

Technology is a powerful ally in today's global crisis. The ongoing pandemic has forced people, companies, countries to introspect and created this new urgency for Digital Transformation. This is the time when experts all around the world have one voice: DIGITIZE\n2. Python is emerging to be the top choice for Data Scientist, owing to the EASE of learning\n3. Cloud based Learning and Computing Platforms, like Kaggle and Colab are the gears to make your journey faster into Data Science Realm.\n4. In the next 2 years, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure Machine Learning, MongoDB, Tableau, PowerBI, Spotfire will be the most sought-after skills. More and more people are planning to invest, adapt and explore these budding technologies\n5. With technologies like Big Data, Machine Learning, Business Analytics taking the front seat, the people and hence the businesses are moving forward at a pace that was never imagined before.
