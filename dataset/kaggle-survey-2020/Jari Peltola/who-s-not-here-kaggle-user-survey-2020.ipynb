Introduction","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook takes on one particular research question regarding the 2020 Kaggle user survey. The question posed to the data is \"who is here?\" Or, rather, \"who is not here?\"\n\nOf course one must take into account that the question cannot be directly answered by using survey data for reasons concerning accuracy. We can only analyze data from people who actually took part in the survey, and this group may well differ from overall Kaggle population to some extent. However, since no validation data on the subject is available, in this notebook the presupposition will be made that the 2020 survey answers equal to actual Kaggle user base when it comes to more detailed data such as age, gender and education.\n\nOne could say that Kaggle has - right from the start - omitted the principle of inclusion in how the service works. True, the English language barrier may hinder some people from participating but then again the data itself is indeed not written in English, and all datasets are available for all users. There is no such thing as Kaggle+ or Kaggle Premium regarding data access (knock on digital wood on that one...)\n\nThis notebook concentrates on the first five survey data answer columns (Q1-Q5). These columns consist of data regarding age, gender, country of reside, level of formal education and occupation title. This data will be analyzed from the viewpoint of the aforementioned research question. Where are Kaggle users *not* from? How old are they *not*? What are they *not* doing regarding education and occupation?\n\nNo pre-analysis hypotheses will be made on research question. Let's just jump in the data pool and start swimming.\n\n*December 15th, 2020* <br>\n*Jari Peltola*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Therefore the occupation approach will not tell us the whole truth about the people who occasionally use data analytics in their everyday work in one form or another.\n\nAll in all the same principle goes to Kaggle users in general. From the viewpoint of data analysis, more diverse data is always better than one-sided view. The same applies to Kaggle as a community.
