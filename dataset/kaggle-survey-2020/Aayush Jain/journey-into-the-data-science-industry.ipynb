One reason could be that Data Science is a very lucrative career. Working in the industry even for a few years might be enough for some to retire and enjoy a peaceful life. Also, we need to also consider in the fact that Data Science is a relatively new term. Most of the people in the upper age bracket might still be doing Data Science work, but its just that their job titles are not Data Scientists per se. Yet another factor might be that people tend to give up roles that require such significant amounts of learning even in the later stage of their career. Life-long learning is something that is not attractive for everyone. </p>\n</div>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"create3StepSankey2020(df, 'Q2', 'The Odds and the Evens - Gender', excludeVal=['Prefer not to say'], linkColorVaibhav=[15,19,23], linkColorAayush=[7])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/images/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>There's a huge gender imbalance in Data Science!</p> \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/images/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n  <p>Yes, unfortunately there is.
