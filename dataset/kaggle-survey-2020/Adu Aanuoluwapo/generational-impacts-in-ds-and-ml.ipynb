However, the term 'Data Science' has only been around since the the early 2000s and in recent years, there have been an increase in the discuss around Data Science and more people seem to be venturing into the field. \n\nThe Harvard Business Review in an article publiched in 2012 describes Data Science as the sexiest job of the 21st century. In 2017, Harvard Data Science Initiative was launched to better harness the power of data sources in research. This was followed by the institution of learning releasing online Data Science courses and then starting a MSC program in the field in 2018. Aside postulations of increased entry into the Data Science field, these steps taken by Harvard goes to show that there are new opportunities for people to study and earn Data Science degrees which further enhances its attractiveness.\n\nKaggle has conducted an annual survey of the Data Science and ML community since 2017. Since Millennials are the largest generation and it is often said that they make up for the majority of the total workforce, there is a likelihood that majority of newbies in the data science community are millennials.\n\nThis notebook seeks to explore **age** from the generational perspective.\n\nIn 2017, Millennials were aged between 21-36 and Generation Z were aged between 5-20. Generations before Millennials have been merged to be called 'Older generations'.
