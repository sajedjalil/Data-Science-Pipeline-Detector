Inside the table each Survey question corresponds to:\n* One column, if only one choice could be selected as answer to this question\n* Mulitple columns, if multiple choices could be selected as an answer to this question\n\nEach row corresponds to a Survey participant. \n\nAs it is already known, the dataset has 20,036 rows and 335 columns. Which means that the Survey participants is 20,036 in number.\n\n**Supplementary data**: The Kaggle Survey 2020 dataset come along with two .PPT files that contain the methodology applied for the Survey and the questionary with the exact questions and answer choices that the participants have recieved to answer.\n\n### Defining the 'Kaggler'\nFrom now on in this notebook each Kaggle Survey 2020 participant will be called a 'Kaggler'.

How many of the Kagglers are students?\n2. What are the three most used learning platforms by the Kagglers?\n3. Which programming language is most used by the most experienced data scientists?\n4. Inside the experienced coders group with which other languages Python is  simultaneously used?\n5. What programming language is the most recommend for an aspiring data scientist to learn first?\n6. Which platform is the most used for sharing and deploying Data Science projects?\n7. The use of platforms for sharing DS projects differs among the different professional roles?\n8. Which are the most important activities of each professional role?\n9. \n  a) Which are the most used Machine Learning frameworks by the group of: i) Research Scientists ii) Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers?\n  \n  b) Which are the most used Machine Learning algorithms by the group of: i) Research Scientists ii) Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers?\n  \n10. What tools of data analysis is mostly used by the Kagglers who are currently working at the Data Science field in any professional role?\n\nThese questions came on my mind, the one after the other, while analysing the dataset and at the same time keeping on my mind the goal of this notebook.
