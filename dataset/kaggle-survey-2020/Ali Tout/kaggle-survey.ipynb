What I've attempted to analyze in the Kaggle Survey is the relationships between gender, age, country, company, online academies, compensation, degree, and multiple data science tools to see how these factors affect each other. Some of these factors are unchangeable (country) but others are based on choice (online academies); my questions primarily focus on the relationship between gender and degree with other features.\n\nThe approach I used to analyze the Kaggle survey focused on combining up to 3 features which helped answer more complex questions . My main goal is to prove the obvious using data and to uncover trends or relationships that are not so obvious.\n\nMy analysis is focused on: \n1. Age and gender distribution \n2. Relationsip between programming languages used and degrees obtained \n3. Relationship between programming languages used and gender \n4. Distribution of countries Kagglers are located in and their gender\n5. Relationship between Visualization tools used and the degree Kagglers have  obtained\n6. Relationship between Kagglers assigned role at work, the degree they obtained, and their gender\n7. Relationship between Online academies Kagglers attended and what ML models Kagglers use on a regular basis\n8. The gender distribution across companies of different sizes\n9. The gender distribution across companies of different sizes based on the degree they hold\n10. Relationship between Degree obtained and the automation tool the Kaggler uses.\n11. Relationship between Degree obtained, the number of years coding the Kaggler has been coding, and their compensation.\n12.
