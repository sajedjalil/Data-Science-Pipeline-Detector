Another interesting thing is that based on this calcuation, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and Canada are the only countries among all the countries to have mean salaries lower than their median salaries. \n\nFinally, the very high income group contains countries with median compensation above 90,000$. There are only three countries in this group.

GDP per capita here serves as the average prosperity of an individual in a particular country. A ratio of 1 for a country means that the median compensation of the participants from that country in the survey is more or less the same as the GDP per capita of that country so we would expect the data science employees to have a relatively similar standard of living to an average citizen. A ratio higher than 1 would indicate that the country is providing a higher standard of living for its data science employees than the average citizen whereas a ratio below 1 would indicate that working in a data science related field might provide a worse standard of living than what GDP per capita shows. \n\nIn the bar chart, we see many of the middle eastern / northern african countries such as Iran, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey fall towards the lower end of the spectrum. These countries typically have a higher GDP per capita than countries like Kenya, Philipines and Ghana but their median compensation for the data science field is not much higher than the median compensation of the three aforementioned countries, which results in a very low median salary to GDP per capita ratio. In a way, I think that these countries have the option of paying their data science employees better since they seem to have high enough GDP per capita for that but they don't (maybe there might be some other regional factor affecting this result). On the upper end of the spectrum, we see USA, Israel and Switzerland again but we also see that Nepal and South Africa have higher median compensations than their GDP per capitas. In the middle part, Korea and Singapore seems to have surprisingly low ratios (around 0.5). Another thing to note is that close to 70\\% of these countries have a ratio less than 1."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nThere are many factors that affects the compensation of a ML/DS employee. ML experience and Coding experience usually is a good indicator of what salary one might expect but we also see that the structure of the company (company size, ML colleagues, ML use at work etc.) plays a good role in determining how much salary one could get as well. The education also has some effect on the compensation although its influence seems to be rather more limited than the other factors we have mentioned so far. \n\nThen, there is the question whether the gender affects the compensation or not. When we look at the gender pay gap, there is always a difference (most often in the favor of men) but how much difference we see higly relies on what factors we take into account when we are looking at the salary distributions. Accounting for coding and ML experiences seem to be giving us the smallest gap although there still is a gap whereas accounting for age or education results in larger gaps between men and women.\n\nHowever, we also need to keep in mind that the salary analysis here mostly depends on the data from USA and we know that the compensation could vary significantly from one country to another. In fact, country of employment is the biggest factor affecting one's compensation and it also causes the largest gap among the employess from different countries. It would be interesting to analyze the other countries in a way similar to USA and see if any of the previously mentioned factors change significantly for any other country. Alas, I do not think that there is enough data here to do an in depth salary analysis of each and every country."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
