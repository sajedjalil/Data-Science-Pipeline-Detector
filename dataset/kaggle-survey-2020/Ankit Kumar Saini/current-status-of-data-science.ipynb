The majority of data science practitioners have less than 30 years of age and most of them are male.\n2. India has the highest number of data science practitioners according to the survey.\n3. The majority of data science practitioners are students and most of them have coding experience of less than 1 year.\n\n### Most regulary used/preferred tools and products/platforms\n1. Python is the most preferred language\n2. Matplotlib is the most preferred visualization library\n3. Scikit learn is the most regularly used ML framework\n4. Logistic/Linear regression is the most regularly used ML algorithm\n5. Jupyter (lab, notebook) is the most preferred IDE\n6. Colab notebooks are the most regularly used hosted notebook products\n7. ImageNet architectures (such as ResNet, VGG, Inception, ect.) are the most regularly used computer vision methods\n8. Word embeddings are the most frequently used Natural Language Processing methods\n9. Amazon Web Servie (AWS) is the most regularly used cloug computing platform\n10. Amazon EC2 is the most preferred cloud computing product\n11. Google Cloud AI Platform/ML Engine is the most regularly used ML product\n12. MySQL is the most regularly used big data product\n13. GitHub is the most preferred choice for publicly sharing code\n14. Coursera is the most preferred platform to gain data science skills.\n\n### Comparison of data science practitioners in India and USA\n#### The salary of data science practitioner in the USA is much hihger than the practitioners in India. The possible reasons for this large difference in the salary could be:\n\n1. The majority of data science practitioners in India have Bachelor's degree while in the USA, tha majority of practitioners have Masters/Doctoral degree. Very small number of practitioners have Bachelors degree. \n\n2. In the USA, the majority of practitioners have rich coding experience (more than 5 years) while in India the majority of practitioners have less 5 years of coding experience."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
