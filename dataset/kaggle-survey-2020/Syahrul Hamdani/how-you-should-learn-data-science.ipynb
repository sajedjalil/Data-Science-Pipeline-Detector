A lot of bad things happen, from career shifting for professionals to online learning for students. People are struggling. One common characteristic is that we **learn** to adapt in a flash.\n\nThe government have tried to tranquillize us using data. In Indonesia, IMO, some of it makes sense, but most of it doesn't. But, at least the decision-making processes are **based on data**.\n\nUnfortunately, people who are in charge of extracting insights and contributing to those decision-making processes are still wanted. We have the resources in terms of people, but we still need more of them.\n\nSo...\n\nIs Indonesia lack data scientist, or generally speaking, data talents a lot?\n\nOver and above that, how are exactly Indonesian data scientists or machine learning engineers' state?\n\nFor aspiring data scientists, how should they learn data science, driven by (post-)pandemic circumstances?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import textwrap\n\ntry:\n    import countrygroups\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError:\n    !pip install countrygroups\n    import countrygroups\nimport json\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Points At Issue\n\nMotivated by previous \"why\"-es, I explored the 2020 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey to at least try to uncover the answers for some questions below.\n\n* How are data talents in Indonesia?\n* What are the most used data science tools and platforms?\n* How does someone, especially Indonesian, should learn to break into the field of data science?\n\nLet's gather the dataset and inspect the first 5 rows."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_kaggle = pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv\")\n\n# create mappings from column names to questions\ndict_kaggle_questions = df_kaggle.loc[0].to_dict()\n\n# drop questions in row 0\ndf_kaggle.drop(index=0, inplace=True)\n\ndf_kaggle.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We've already created a dictionary to map each column name to corresponding question.

Or if not, at least you should focus on Python first.\n\nBasic methods such as linear or logistic regression are the most frequently used algorithm. Since it constructs a vital foundation for more complex models, you may want to start digest those basics first.\n\n> There’re still few respondents who use evolutionary approaches on their regular basis, in all subgroups. Huge respect for evoluationary approaches!\n\nIn computer vision world, downstream tasks like image classification and object detection may become a routine for professional or research scientist. Hence, methods which deal with that kind of tasks are among the 3 most used methods, along with other general-purpose vision tools, like PIL, cv2, skimage, etc.\n\nAt the same time, in the NLP world, word embedding like word2vec or fastText is among the most used NLP methods. This is because word embedding/vectors are required to apply other advance methods, like encoder-decoder models or Transformers language models.\n\nNext, if we inspect the above visualization about core activities at work for SEA countries and global, they have the same level of urgency in what they do at work. As we all can see, **analyzing and understanding data to influence products and business decisions** become a regular thing yet the most important one.\n\nWhile in Indonesia, analyzing data to influence products is still the most selected core activities, but data infrastructure still the second have-to-do activity. Only then, they focus on prototyping, deploying model, and then research. Even iteration to improve the existing model is the lowest citizen in the work if you compare with other 2 subgroups.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n* Most data professionals in Indonesia are bachelor graduate compare to data professionals globally which are master graduate. We can’t say whether this is a lack, though.\n* Python is still, by far, irreplaceable programming language to use for data science.\n* Traditional software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets is the main statistical tools to analyze and exploring data. While globally, the local development environment like JupyterLab or RStudio is the main tools, as well as in other SEA countries (almost the same with traditional software)\n* Vital foundational methods like linear or logistic regression still worth to learn first. Besides it’s foundational, they are still used either as a first model iteration or it’s just the right model to use with the lowest cost and good performance.\n* Although Coursera is the most popular MOOC in other 2 subgroups, respondents from Indonesia mostly use Kaggle Learn Courses to learn data science.\n* Data pipeline may be still an issue in Indonesia since most respondents state it as second important work after analyzing and understanding data.\n* Data talents in Indonesia could be still in the development phase where they try to connect all important end-to-end data pipeline while they also learn to apply fancy machine learning models."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
