But one of other important goals is to create and publish notebooks that accurately summarize the results of the analysis and provide a reference for prediction and discussion. In order to analyze, visualize, and put the data into kaggle notebook, we need to be familiar with visualization tools. The data of this competition has the data which represents how kaggle users use the tools.\n\nUsing those data, I will proceed with the discussion as follows.\n\n1. First, I will analyze these data to see what tools kaggle users use to visualization.\n1. Next, I will combine the data with other data in this dataset to identify what characteristics of kaggle users who are familiar with the tools (can use a lot of tools). In particular, I focused on the impact of the availability of the BI tool for the reasons described in motivation.\n1. Finally, based on the results of the analysis, I will suggest what we can do with kaggle.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u>Goal of this notebook</u>\n\n* Find out how kaggle users are using the visualization tools.\n\n* Identify the characteristics of users who are familiar with many visualization tools.\n\n* Suggest measures that can be taken in kaggle to promote to use more variety of methods in kaggle notebook."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u>Motivation</u>\n\nA lot of people publish kaggle notebooks, but I feel that there is a big difference in terms of the proficiency of the tools. For example, even though using the same seaborn, I was sometimes stunned to see that while I had only very simple line plots with it, the experts were using sunburst plots and clustermap to create elegant and accurate visualizations. Some people use Plotly to turn on/off unnecessary graphs to make their analysis more compact, and others use Geoplotlib to draw easy-to-understand choropleth on maps. How experts learn and be familiar with such graph types? How can a non-expert kaggler step up to the next level? Since I was interested in such things, I wanted to clarify one way of doing so through this analysis.\n\nFor this analysis, I were particularly interested in whether the availability of BI tools would affect the number of visualization tools available to users. If we are familiar with BI tool, we can achieve a wide variety of good looking visualizations very fast. This means that users who are familiar with BI tools know many examples of ideal visualizations, and they should be working hard to reproduce or update them in their kaggle notebooks.\n\nAlso I feel that in the actual analysis field, we are required to use BI tools, not only just like the jupyter nootbook used in kaggle. For example, when a data analysis infrastructure is built, the user interface of the infrastructure is often a BI tool such as Tableau, and the analyst is required to be proficient in using the BI tool. Now we cannot use BI tools in kaggle, but since the above reason, I believe that kaggle as a platform for data analysts cannot ignore to incorporate the BI tool. Therefore, I will pay special attention to the impact of the BI tool in our analysis."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"--------------------"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load libraries and dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import collections\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nimport itertools\nimport math\nimport os\nimport re\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I load kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv.
