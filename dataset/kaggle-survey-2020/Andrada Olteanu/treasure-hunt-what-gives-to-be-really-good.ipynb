though one would expect some complicated answers, they still use and rely the most on simple structures, like Regressions, Tree-Based models, Image Classification, or Word Embeddings for NLP. Most loved frameworks are Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Matplotlib, with no complicated or additional current preference for miscellaneous tools.</p>\n  <p>There IS something to learn here. There was a tweet from Grandmaster <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz\">Bojan Tunguz</a> that was sarcastically stating that all models besides Neural Nets are obsolete and you should focus only on these. The takeaway here is that no simple method, tool, or model is \"redundant\", not even for the great of the great. And this chapter shows precisely that.</p>\n</div>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OmlXHgw.png\" width=700>\n\n> And finally, our map is completely revealed!\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0EanMig.jpg\">\n\n> Closer look 🔎\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kv3fJhx.jpg\" width=700>\n\n\n# 4. Conclusion\n\nI for one would have loved to see a survey like this when I started, some 1 year and a half ago. With no experience and no slight clue what data science is, what programming language do I need to know, how do you do machine learning, what is a notebook, how deep is deep learning, and ... for the love of God, GPUs? And, with the internet full of healthy and diverse opinions, it is easy to get lost and start not to trust the sources.\n\nHence, I truly hope that this analysis will bring some light for anybody in any query they might have. However small or big, I think that it's best to ask a professional, a great veteran in the discipline, a guru, a <span style=\"background:#fed56f; font-weight:bold; color:black\">Grandmaster :)</span> what is the best way to learn that specific subject? And if this notebook helped you just a bit getting closer to your answers, or a mentor, I can declare myself happy and fulfilled. I know it helped me, at least.\n\nGood luck, and may we all succeed with grace. Happy Data Sciencin'!\n\n# 5.
