It includes mixed model, predictive response model. In addition, they must use optimization techniques to meet the business needs of customers.\n    \n+ They have to develop and install statistical tools. it helps to build predictive models. These models assist customers in customer marketing and demand creation initiatives.\n    \n+ Data scientist collaborates with internal consulting groups to provide analytical goals and approaches. In addition, scheduling work to provide programming and analysis support for internal consulting. In addition, good storytelling, communication, and problem solving skills are essential for most jobs. Again, keep one thing in mind.
