I haven't analysed all questions across the surveys. Instead I've focused on a few areas I'm particularly interested in understanding more about.\n\nI've been away for a while but it's good to be back amongst the Kaggle community. When I saw this competition I had grand plans to explore many aspects of these surveys and put together the mother of all notebooks. However work, spending time with my wife and dog, running, Christmas and COD Warzone got in the way, so the scope of this notebook has shortened somewhat. In true PhD thesis style though I've included a further work section at the end for stuff I might get to at some point.\n\nI think exploring the reasons behind analysis outputs is one of the most interesting aspects of working in the field of Data Science. So since we're in this no-pressure environment (i.e. no one is going to lose out financially or otherwise if I give a wildly incorrect hypothesis) I aim to provide commentary around the outputs where I can. We're all domain experts to some extent in this area so if anyone has any further insights or alternate suggestions for some of the results then I'd love to hear them.\n\nIncase you're already getting tired of my rambling, here are some headline insights to take away from this work:\n* **Students** have surged from 5.9% of respondents in 2017 to 25.8% of respondents in 2020\n* In 2020, 43.4% of students are based in **India** and the number of Indian students has increased x10 since 2017\n* **Data Scientist** is consistently the most popular occupation amongst Kagglers but has reduced in popularity by 7.3% in the last year\n* Salaries vary by role. They remain largely stable in the US over the past four years, but are more changeable in other countries\n\n## Some motivation for this work - What's my role again?\n\nData Science is a very broad topic, and a Data Scientist can cover a lot of roles in a company. I work for a small analytics company with a team of 3 - 4 data scientists and we cover many aspects of work in our roles, including data acquisition, product development, project management, and customer support (as well as some actual data science). When I filled in the 2020 survey and got to the current role question, it was hard to answer.\n\nI have a Bachelors degree in Maths, and eventually managed to complete a part time PhD whilst working full time. In terms of roles, I started as a student, my first professional role was as a research associate, then I tried 'Mathematician' for a while, and also mulled over 'Quantitative Analyst' (I found it hard to say, so dropped it). A few years into my professional career, I went to the predictive analytics world conference in San Francisco where Anthony Goldbloom gave the keynote speech about the Heritage Health Prize competition. In another talk I attended, a speaker (unfortunately I can't remember his name) summarised at the end of his presentation by saying - \"to do well, learn Python, learn R, change your job title to Data Scientist, and ask for a pay rise\". It got a big cheer. I promptly went and found my boss, who had been watching a different talk, and told him I was now a data scientist and I needed a pay rise. He laughed, and agreed. \n\nData Scientist has stuck since then. On my business card and email signature I'm a data scientist. But maybe I'm actually more of a product/project manager, or maybe I'm a data analyst? Maybe I'm something else? Maybe this is a common thing for Data Scientists. I'm not sure. It would be great if I could use these surveys to help me make things clearer.\n\n## Some notes about compiling the annual survey results\n\nI initially focused on the following areas across the surveys -\n* **Role** - I tidied up the various role options across the years, hopefully without changing anyone's actual role too much. I had to look up what some actually were. There were separate questions for unemployement and student status in the 2017 survey so these have been added to the roles to be consistent with following years.\n* **Country** - some country names were captured differently across the surveys but on the whole this was pretty clean to compile.\n* **Salary** - these were a lot of fun to compile. 2019 and 2020 were the same format, however 2018 was captured in different bands, and 2017 captured individual amounts in the repondants own currency. Thank goodness Kaggle provided a conversion table. I had to create a new set of salary bands that all the results would fit into."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"survey17 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2017/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', encoding='latin-1')\nconversionrates17 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2017/conversionRates.csv')\nsurvey18 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2018/multipleChoiceResponses.csv')\nsurvey19 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\nsurvey20 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract info we initially want to use from the survey data\n# 2017 survey\nresponses17 = survey17[['GenderSelect', 'Country', 'EmploymentStatus', 'StudentStatus', 'CurrentJobTitleSelect', 'CompensationAmount', 'CompensationCurrency']] # columns\nresponses17.insert(0, 'ResponseID', range(1, 1 + len(responses17))) # add a response ID\nresponses17.loc[(responses17['EmploymentStatus'] == 'Not employed, but looking for work') | (responses17['EmploymentStatus'] == 'Not employed, and not looking for work'), 'CurrentJobTitleSelect'] = 'Not Employed' # add not employed to jobs list\nresponses17.loc[(responses17['StudentStatus'] == 'Yes'), 'CurrentJobTitleSelect'] = 'Student' # add student to jobs list\nresponses17.loc[(responses17.CurrentJobTitleSelect.isna()), 'CurrentJobTitleSelect'] = 'Other' # fill in job blanks with other\n# these next few lines about currency took a while to make work.

Let me put my discussion cap on.\n* Students rising! Student Kagglers dominate the most recent survey by some way, increasing from 20.4% to 25.8% of responses from the previous year. Kaggle is clearly an increasingly valuable resource for students. Remarkably, students made up only 5.9% of responses back in 2017. There are probably a number of factors contributing to the huge increase since then. Speculating on the spot - reasons could include increasing demand for data specialists in industry, general increased availablity of data science degrees and courses, and ofcourse, Kaggle continuing to roll out their own free learning courses (which are great, by the way).\n* Survey design could have impacted some of the ability to compare the results fairly across years. In particular, the 2017 survey was rather different to the following surveys in terms of design and the focus of questions. There were far more questions wanting the opinion of the person - topics like job title accuracy, job satisfaction, most important job factors, etc. Potentially Kaggle were getting to know who their users were and what they value. Whereas the more recent surveys are more black and white - what do you do, what do you use, etc. I imagine Kaggle will use this information to make sure their products are calibrated to the skills and tools of most of their users, which makes sense. Ofcourse, Kaggle may just have had some feedback after 2017 saying the survey was a bit long and hard to answer, and so they simplified it a bit. Specifically though on the subject of job titles, employement status and student status were individual questions in 2017. 13.7% of people responded as 'Not working' when asked about their employment status, compared to 3.5% in 2018. Perhaps this is where some unnamed students could have been hiding? *Note: after 2017, both these questions were removed and 'Student' and 'Not Employed' became job title options.*\n* Data Scientist is consistently the most common professional role, although considerably less people selected it as their job title this year. Is being a Data Scientist no longer cool? Or is it increasingly ok and appreciated to be something else instead?\n* A lot of people have job titles outside the selection options (or would prefer not to say what their job title is). Kaggle haven't provided any output from the free-form text responses, so we won't go any further into what these other roles are.\n* Responders indicating they are Not Employed is on the rise - up from 4.8% to 8.2% in 2020. Again, there could be several factors affecting this. Increases in student Kagglers mean there will presumably be increases in Kagglers transitioning from education to professional careers, with potentially some amount of time inbetween where they are not employed. Kaggle's increased offering of learning courses and dataset access is probably also increasingly attractive to those currently not working who are looking to boost their skills and job prospects. Ofcourse another more sobering potential reason for increased unemployment is the year that is 2020 and the devasting global impacts of covid. All the best to anyone impacted by covid in any way, health, career or other, I hope you get back up to speed soon.\n* There is a fair amount of changing job selection options in the survey. Some of the more periferal job selections aren't given every year, with many only given once. The Kaggle guys are potentially tweaking the survey options based on their own internal priorities, or someone different is writing the survey each year ;). The job title options certainly aren't determined purely on previous popularity though, with roles such as Consultant, Programmer and Computer Scientist having far more responses in the years they were options than roles such as Statistician or the very rare Database Engineer. I imagine since roles like Statasticians and DB Engineers are fundamental to the core topic of data science, they remain in the survey regardless of the number of responses, where as some of the others may be a bit vague. Who knows. Machine Learning Engineers are celebrating though! Dropped after 2017 before being reinstated in 2020 and picking up a very respectable 5.4% of responses. Maybe some digging in the Other category might highlight more about what is going on here.\n\nMy brain's hurting now from thinking, so lets produce some more plots.\n\nFirst up, where on earth (literally) are those students coming from?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create table just for student responses\nstudents = responses[responses['JobTitle'] == 'Student']\n\n# summarise student responses by survey year\nstudentsummary = surveysum(students, ['SurveyYear'])\n\n# summarise students by country and survey year\nstudentcountrysummary = surveysum(students, ['SurveyYear', 'Country'])\n\n# join summaries and calculate %\nstudentcountrysummary = pd.merge(studentcountrysummary, studentsummary, on = 'SurveyYear')\nstudentcountrysummary['StudentResponsePrcnt'] = studentcountrysummary['Responses_x']/studentcountrysummary['Responses_y']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# plot country percentage for student responses\nstudentcountrysummary17 = studentcountrysummary[studentcountrysummary['SurveyYear'] == '2017']\nstudentcountrysummary18 = studentcountrysummary[studentcountrysummary['SurveyYear'] == '2018']\nstudentcountrysummary19 = studentcountrysummary[studentcountrysummary['SurveyYear'] == '2019']\nstudentcountrysummary20 = studentcountrysummary[studentcountrysummary['SurveyYear'] == '2020']\n\nfig = go.Figure(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary17['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary17['StudentResponsePrcnt'], name='2017', marker_color='#11d16e'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary18['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary18['StudentResponsePrcnt'], name='2018', marker_color='#009db6'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary19['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary19['StudentResponsePrcnt'], name='2019', marker_color='#005db6'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary20['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary20['StudentResponsePrcnt'], name='2020', marker_color='#45025c'))\n\n#fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary17['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary17['Responses_x'], name='2017', marker_color='#11d16e'))\n#fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary18['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary18['Responses_x'], name='2018', marker_color='#009db6'))\n#fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary19['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary19['Responses_x'], name='2019', marker_color='#005db6'))\n#fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x = studentcountrysummary20['Country'], y = studentcountrysummary20['Responses_x'], name='2020', marker_color='#45025c'))\n\nfig.update_layout(barmode='group', \n                  #height = 700,\n                  xaxis_tickangle = -45,\n                  yaxis = dict(tickformat=\".1%\"),\n                  title = \"Student responses by Country and Survey Year (Top 10 Countries by response volume)\",\n                  xaxis_title = \"Country\",\n                  yaxis_title = \"Percentage of students in survey year\",\n                  legend_title = \"Survey Year\",\n                  xaxis = {'categoryorder':'total descending'},)\nfig.update_xaxes(range=(-.5, 9.5))\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's pretty clear what's going on - almost half of all Kaggle students are based in India, up from 24.5% of students in 2017 to 43.4% of students in 2020.

They're certainly different to those in the US. It looks like we generally get paid less over here. I feel like we're a few years behind the US in terms of the establishment of Data Science in business, but tech companies are growing all over the country and data science will only continue to grow, as can be seen by the increased proportion of respondants with higher salaries. It also looks like there are two salary distributions in here - a lower salary group around 50k, and a higher salary group around 100k. This might be due to different salary grades in the public and private sectors. Again, this is pure speculation at this point - I'm sure I could put more time into investigating the underlying reasons."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Further work when I get time\n* Further exploration into the underlying reasons for role and salary trends\n* Add some more interesting plots (bar charts are ok, but it would be nice to have more variety)\n* Build a classification model to predict what my job title should be.
