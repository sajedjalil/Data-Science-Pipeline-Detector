Close to 50% of survey respondents worldwide age 55-59 are currently unemployed. This should be contrasted with an unemployment percentage of \\~24% in the 30-39 age range. <br />\n<br /> \n - For the US, the highest unemployment rate (47%) is for respondents age 60-69, while the lowest (~20%) is for respondents in the 30-44 age range. <br />\n<br />\n - Having a Doctoral or Master's degree seems to provide an edge to data scientists with respect to employment. The fraction of unemployed data scientists with a Master's was \\~36% in the unemployed group vs. \\~49% in the employed. The fraction of unemployed data scientists with a PhD (7.2%) was about half of that of the employed with PhD (16.1%).
