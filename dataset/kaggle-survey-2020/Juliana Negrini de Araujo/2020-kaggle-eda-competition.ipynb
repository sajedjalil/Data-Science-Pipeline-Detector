Overview**\n\nIn 2020, as in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Kaggle platform conducted an industry survey with the intent to present a genuinely comprehensive view of the current state of data science and machine learning. The questionnaire collected 20,036 and was live for 3.5 weeks in October 2020.\n\nAs one can imagine, there is a lot to explore. The results can support insights about the people behind the data, machine learning application across different industries and the most valued skills to break into the Data Science field. The data has been published in a raw format while maintaining the privacy of the survey respondents.  \n\nThe report is organised as follows. Section [Profile](#3.-Profile) analyses the respondents' general profile, country, gender, and age. Next, a dive into the business data is shown in Section [The Industry](#4.-Industry). Lastly, Section [Skills](#5.-Skills) examines the skills, the tools and future trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2.

Especially for age groups above 24 years old\n* For a Data Scientist career, a Master's degree seems to be favourable. The percentage of Data Scientists that hold a Masters degree is double if compared to Bachelor's degree holders\n* Almost 60% of doctorates are working as Research Scientists.

Conclusion**\n\nThe EDA focused on understanding the Kaggle and Data Science Community. While spread worldwide, we saw a predominance of India and USA participants. We also learned that most participants hold at least a Master's degree, and that formal education does pose a weight on the future role. \n\nThe USA is where most doctorates reside, even though Switzerland has a higher percentage of doctorates considering its number of respondents. The numbers on gender and diversity were not exciting and have a similar trend across the diverse set of countries. However, we did see a higher percentage of partcipation of women and other minority groups in younger ages, providing hope that the tide is lifting everyone.\n\nThe relevant participation of third world countries, such as Brazil and Nigeria, also shows how technology can connect us all and make such countries more competitive. Fortunately, Data Science only requires passion and a decent internet connection. The amount of material and support of the DS community is great and makes it a great example of a career without boundaries.","metadata":{}}]}
