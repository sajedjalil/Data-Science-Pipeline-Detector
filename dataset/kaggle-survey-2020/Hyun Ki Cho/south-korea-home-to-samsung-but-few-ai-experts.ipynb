Because I had lived most of my life in the US, I didn't know what to expect when I entered the service. So far, it has been a tumultuous experience in which I met, talked, and lived with randomly selected South Koreans from all over the nation. Through it, I was, albeit forcefully, somewhat reconnected to the culture of my home country. When talking to fellow soldiers, I discovered a significant amount of people who had a pessimistic outlook on their futures, and Korea's future. Some even compared living in Korea to \"hell.\" When I was researching why Korea's AI sector was lagging, I found that the same societal problems that my fellow soldiers struggled with were also hurting the AI industry. \n\nThere's a certain irony to this.  Many see Korea as a high-tech first world nation and think first about the glitz and glamor of Korean idols, or Samsung phones when they first think about the country. But beneath all the neon lights, there lie deeply ingrained societal problems and a weak AI sector that is hurt by them. \n\nI found that South Korea, despite being home to renowned tech superpowers like Samsung, is lacking in its AI sector due to 3 main factors: the education system, the gender gap, and brain drain. \n\n**Table of Contents**\n1.

It's a smaller country, so it has less respondents to the survey compared to some larger countries, and it has a gender gap in respondents, like practically every country in the world. But I found something interesting that prompted my research into the state of Korea's AI sector. Korea's userbase on Kaggle has been fairly stagnant over the years after a growth spike in 2018. Take 2020's survey for example - just 11 more users participated in this year's survey compared to last year's. \n\nThis is more apparent when we compare Korea's percentage growth in users compared to 2017 to other countries. **Korea's percentage growth since 2017 stayed fairly consistent from 2018 to 2020, hovering at around 35%.** Admittedly, there are countries like the United States that have had their userbase decrease after 2018, but have a strong AI sector. But there are also countries with strong AI sectors like Japan and India that have shown continual growth. Although less people participated in the survey in Japan in 2020 than 2019, Japan's userbase has continued growing overall, ending at 130% growth this year. India's userbase, on the other hand, has continued to grow each year, ending at 116% growth this year. \n\nKaggle is arguably one of the best places to learn the basics of machine learning and apply them to competitions that are available all year round. Kagglers also have the opportunity to learn from each other through notebooks. The number of Kaggle users for a country doesn't accurately represent how competitive their AI resources are, but it can be an indicator. Korea is nearly stagnant in that regard. The data surprised me because it indicated that data science and AI hadn't taken off completely in Korea yet, despite it housing tech powerhouses like Samsung. This led me to dig deeper.

This isn't such a big surprise if you consider two things. One, South Korea's culture is heavily influenced by Confucianism, which places a high importance on education. Two, South Korea went from one of the poorest countries in the world in the 1950s, to the world's 12th largest economy in 2018, in no small part due to extensive government investment in education[2]. Due to this, and other historical factors, Koreans see education as a means to economic prosperity. \n\nThis trend is well and alive today. In 2019, \"Elementary, middle and high school students spent 20.99 trillion won (17.6 billion USD) on private education[3].\" And some studies show that many South Korean students spend 16 hours or more studying at school and attending private prep schools called *hagwons*[2]. This is because **students' scores on *Suneung*, a nationally conducted standardized test for college admissions, is a deciding factor in what colleges they will attend, future income, employment prospects, and even future relationships[4].** Education is not just a stressful topic for South Koreans. It is the root of mental health problems that hurt countless South Korean students, even if they're still in elementary school.[5].\n\nBut if Korean students are so educated, they must be well-prepared to study topics such as AI and data science, right? Wrong. The South Korean education system is especially problematic because it is primarily based on rote memorization and test-taking[6]. This means students have trouble figuring out answers to new problems they haven't seen before[7], which is exactly what new and complex fields like AI require. Furthermore, studies show that Korean universities provide less programs to study AI than other nations do[8].\n\nIn this section, I'll show why the Korean education system, particularly universities, are ill-equipped to producing an AI workforce, and how that shows in the Kaggle survey data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inexperience in Machine Learning\n\nThe lack of university resources may be to blame for Korea's inexperience in machine learning.\n\nThe National Information Society Agency, a government agency in Korea, released a report showing that **as of 2018, 0 universities in Korea offered undergraduate, graduate, or doctorate programs for learning AI**. Furthermore, the report stated that **Korea placed last amongst 7 countries (Korea, United States, China, Japan, Europe, India, Israel) in the number of scientific papers published in AI[8]**. Even if Korean university students want to learn machine learning techniques, they have little opportunity to do so in classes. If we compare Korea to the US, a current world leader in AI, we can see that the US has numerous graduate, doctorate, and even undergraduate programs focused on AI[31].\n\nAlthough there is no evidence for causation, we can carefully venture to say that Korean Kagglers have less opportunity to study machine learning techniques in university compared to US Kagglers, which may be part of the reason why Korean Kagglers are inexperienced in machine learning. For a fairer comparison, I used the percentage of Kagglers per experience level rather than raw numbers because due to a larger population, the US is inevitably going to have more people in each category.

What can be done is touching on suggestions for improving the education system's ability to foster AI experts. First, Korea's love affair with standardized tests needs to change. It has built up a system of public and private education that kills the creativity that students will need to survive in today's economy. To do this, more holistic methods of evaluating a person's capabilities must be developed. Furthermore, universities need to create programs that allow students to study AI, and teach students skills that employers find valuable. Korea is already implementing some of these suggestions. \n\nKorea is already planning to change the education system to bolster the AI sector, as a part of the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence laid out by the Moon administration shortly before COVID-19 hit. **In 2021, Korea is planning to introduce AI courses as electives for South Korean high schools**. They will be able to take introductory courses in AI, or AI mathematics, and this increased exposure could cause more students to study AI in university[9]. Furthermore, starting in 2019, AI education began to be introduced to universities. **In 2019, 4 select universities were chosen to create graduate and doctorate programs in AI, and in 2020, 3 more universities did the same**. At the undergraduate levels as well, some universities began to create curriculums specialized for AI, in cooperation with corporations to make sure the curriculum could prepare students for a job in the AI sector[10]. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"Factor2\"></a>\n# Factor 2 - A Gender Chasm\nWomen are dissuaded from entering the workforce, and find it harder to land a job due to gender biases. This is true everywhere in the world, but compared to Western nations, Korean women have more barriers to break through. Choi Mi-Jin, president of the Women Labor Law Support Center, put it this way: **\"Our society is dominated by stereotypes about gender roles. Men are the breadwinners, and women are responsible for child-rearing and housework. This is why gender discrimination in hiring is widely accepted and continues to be practiced.\"[11]**\n\nIt is in South Korea's best interests to bridge this gap. Korea's working age population is expected to decline very soon, which makes better integration of women into the workforce a necessity to maintain economic growth. In 2019, the IMF found that if Korea could raise female participation in the workforce to be the same as male participation by 2035, it would be able to enjoy a **7% GDP growth**. However, if it failed to do so, economic competitiveness would decline due to aging women dropping out of the workforce and there not being enough new women to replace them[12].\n\nThe declining population and gender discrimination affects the AI sector as well. Bridging the gender gap is not only a matter of achieving greater equality, but is also necessary to increase Korea's AI workforce.

In 2018, the World Economic Forum released a report on gender gaps. **The report ranked South Korea at 115th out of 149 countries overall**. The report showed large amounts of wage inequality between genders[13].\n\nThe wage gap is present in the Kaggle survey data as well. South Korea's wage gap between men and women is far more noticeable than that of the world or America. **Korea's gender wage gap based on the median wage is 10,000 USD**. The global wage gap is 10,000 USD as well, but keeping in mind that the global wage is, on average, higher than wages in Korea, Korea has a larger wage gap in proportion. Meanwhile, the US has the same median salary between men and women.\n\nThe data also shows that Korean male Kagglers have a higher range in salary than women do. In case you're unfamiliar with violin plots, violin plots are practically identical to box and whisker plots except for the fact that the width of the plot shows how concentrated datapoints are for that particular y value. For example, since the violin plot is the thickest/stretched out for Korean women at the 45,000 USD mark, we know that of the Korean women surveyed, the highest proportion of them answered that they earn 45,000 USD per year. The violin plot for Korean wages shows that a higher proportion of men than women earn above 45,000 USD, which is the median wage for Korean women. Furthermore, **no Korean women earn above 100,000 USD, while no small proportion of Korean men do**. Although the wage gap is evident in the global data and the US data, the graphs don't even come close to showing the pronounced difference that the graph for Korea does. \n\nWithin the data, I excluded any unrealistic data below about 16,000 USD, based on Korea's yearly minimum wage. I also excluded wage data above 300,000 USD because they made the graphs unreadable. An interesting point I found when excluding outliers above 300,000 USD was that globally and in the US, both men and women had these high earners. **In Korea, women did not have high outlier salaries above 300,000 USD, while men did.**\n\nIf employers were less discriminatory towards women, then more women would be motivated to stay in the workplace, and therefore bolster the AI workforce.

experts with doctorates in Korea will often leave the country to escape the poor research infrastructure and pursue better opportunities[19].**\n\nBrain drain is only partly due to foreign companies offering more lucrative opportunities to Korean AI experts than domestic companies do. It is also caused by the fact that Koreans, AI experts or not, want to leave Korea. Young Koreans view living in Korea as a living hell, giving birth to a nickname for the country: *\"Hell Joseon.\"* In a survey from 2019, **79% of women and 71% of men aged between 19 and 34 said they wanted to leave Korea, and within the same age group, 83% of women and 78% of men said they viewed their country as \"hell.\"** The consensus between the younger(age 19-34) and older(age 35-59) generations was not as large for the previous two survey questions, but older and younger generations agreed resoundingly on the third survey question. **Around 89% of women and 82% of men, both older and younger, believed that people born into poverty could never compete with those born into wealth[20].** Korea's worsening economic mobility means that no matter how hard people work, they may never be able to improve their standard of living[21]. Although the survey did not state the reason why a higher percentage of women than men had a negative view of Korea, we can think back to the second factor (gender gap), and guess why. \n\nIn fact, the third factor (brain drain) of why Korea's AI sector is suffering is partly due to the first factor (education) and the second factor (gender gap). A hyper-competitive educational system, responsible for a generation of students with poor mental health, stifling societal expectations for both genders, but especially women, and a widening wealth inequality combine to create living conditions that resemble the inside of a pressure-cooker. This is reflected in the fact that South Korea possesses the highest suicide rate out of the OECD nations as of 2017[22]. **South Korean natives want to jump ship to greener pastures outside Korea, even if they aren't AI experts offered better opportunities outside of Korea[23].**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Korean Companies Pay Less, AI Experts Move Elsewhere\n\nKorea's AI workforce is being drained into other countries, especially the US and China, where they offer higher salaries and better environments for research[19]. Because Korea's AI sector is still very young, this especially damages its capability to foster domestic AI talent. \n\nThe difference in wages is reflected in median wage comparisons. **The median wage for both men and women are 10,000 USD higher globally than it is in Korea, and in the United States, it is 67,500 USD higher for women, and 57,500 USD higher for men.** These offers are especially more attractive to women, because they enjoy a relatively higher increase in salary. Considering that many South Koreans want to leave the country, and that foreign countries can offer them a higher salary, it's almost inevitable that Korea's AI talent will continue to move to greener pastures if things don't change.

An additional 2 billion USD is to be invested into AI research by 2022. Furthermore, the government aims to create a \"data dam\" that protects individual privacy yet gives access to large datasets that researchers need to carry out their work.

When the Me Too movement that was started in the United States spread to Korea, women took to the streets and social media to condemn sexual abuse, share their experiences, and prosecute those who had wronged them. Policitians, coaches for professional athletes, abusers in the workplace, and even K-pop stars were tried for sexual abuse[29]. This opened up new discussions about gender inequality in Korea, which are still continuing today. Traditional work culture is also coming under fire as Korean millennials push for work-life balance, bringing about new Korean words such as *\"worabel\"* (short for work-life balance) and *\"kkondae\"* (the Korean equivalent for \"Ok, boomer\"). Improvements for work culture have come in the form of government policies that enforce maximum 52-hour workweeks, along with companies practicing new policies such as paternity leave, and allowing paid leave for employees whenever they choose, even if they're new employees[30].\n\nSpecifically in terms of AI, although Korea may be comparatively lacking in scientific research and university resources at the moment, Korea has an abundance of AI-related startups. **In a 2018 survey done on 7 countries (Korea, US, China, Japan, Europe, India, Israel), Korea placed second in terms of the number of AI startups (465 of them), bested just by the US, which had 1,393[8].** This is shown in the Kaggle survey data shown below as well. **45% of employed Korean Kagglers that chose to reveal the size of their firm reported that their firm employed 0-49 employees, suggesting that many Korean Kagglers work at small firms or startups.** This is another reason to be hopeful that Korea's AI sector will continue to grow. \n\nSome of these Korean AI startups are doing quite well for themselves. One such startup is Riid!, which offers AI-based solutions to education. If this name sounds familiar for some reason, it's because they launched a competition on Kaggle a couple months ago [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Create dictionary to change label names for readability\ncomp_size_conv_dict = {'0-49 employees': '0-49', '50-249 employees': '50-249', '1000-9,999 employees': '1000-9,999',\n                      '250-999 employees': '250-999', '10,000 or more employees': '10,000 or more'}\n\n#Crate dataframe of Korean firm sizes\nkr_comp_size = kr_2020['Q20'].value_counts().to_frame().reset_index()\nkr_comp_size = kr_comp_size.rename(columns = {'index': 'Number of Employees Employed by Firm', 'Q20': 'Number of Firms'})\nkr_comp_size['Number of Employees Employed by Firm'] = kr_comp_size['Number of Employees Employed by Firm'].map(comp_size_conv_dict)\nkr_comp_size = kr_comp_size.reindex([0, 1, 3, 2, 4])\n\n#Create figure\nkr_comp_size_fig, kr_comp_size_ax = plt.subplots(1,1)\nkr_comp_size_fig.set_size_inches(10, 6)\n\n#Plot data\nkr_comp_size_barplot = sns.barplot(data = kr_comp_size,\n                                  x='Number of Employees Employed by Firm', y='Number of Firms',\n                                  palette = ['#FA62A1', 'lightgray', 'lightgray', 'lightgray', 'lightgray'])\nkr_comp_size_barplot.set_title('Size of Firms Korean Kagglers Work At', y=1.10);\nkr_comp_size_barplot.set_xticklabels(kr_comp_size_barplot.get_xticklabels(), rotation = 30);\nsns.despine(left='True')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"Last\"></a>\n# Last Remarks\n\nAs long as Koreans refuse to settle for the status quo and believe in their country, things will get better. Despite the hardships that come with living in Korea, Koreans still like their country deep inside. I know this is true for me and the Koreans I've met - within the service and outside of it. We sometimes give Korea a hard time, but it doesn't come from malicious intent - we just know that things could be so much better, and we have hope that things will change. \n\nMr. Roh, who works as an English teacher in South Korea, put it best: **\"Let’s think of Korea as a big baseball team. This is my baseball team. Sometimes I don’t like my coach, I don’t like my team. My team sucks. But at the same time, inside we want to win the next game. Saying ‘Hell Joseon’ is actually [an] insult to our own team, hoping it might change the country.\"[23]**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"Thanks\"></a>\n# Thanks and References\n\nI'd like to thank my fellow soldiers serving in the Korean military for treating me well and giving me inspiration for this notebook.
