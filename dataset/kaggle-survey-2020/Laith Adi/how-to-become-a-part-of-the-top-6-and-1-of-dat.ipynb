If you live in the USA, you have a higher chance of being in the top 6%. This makes perfect sense. The biggest companies in the world headquaters are in the USA. Some of the best STEM universities are in the states. And so on. \n\n2. Ages 35-44 tend to have a better chance of making more money. This makes sense cause by that age, if you have been in the field long enough, you can have the right amount of expereince and knowledge to excel. Plus Im assuming you also have more energy and time compared to the older people. I dont know for sure though cause Im only 22 :) \n\n3. Your level of education does play a factor in the money you will make down the road. masters or doctoral are the better options. I think this is self explanatory. Education is important and what you do with it is even more important.\n\n4. If you have a high level degree, then experience does not play as strong of a factor to your income compared to a lower level of education. This makes perfect sense to me, again self explanatory. \n\n5. Other factors play a bigger role than years of expereince when you start making more than 300,000. I think this has to do with stuff outside the line of work you do haha.
