Taking a quick glance at the results of the 2020 Kaggle ML & DS Survey, I'd say that many of my fellow Kagglers are preparing for that too - 25% of the >20,000 respondents in the survey were students! \n\nThat got me thinking... How can we leverage the data in this survey to create a roadmap for how to prepare for your dream job? What ML & DS tools and techniques do you need to know? How best to showcase your skillset to potential employers? What level of education do you need in order to be competitive? And before we even get to those job-specific details, what is the right dream job for your interests anyway? Sure, you could just google it... But you'll generally find people's opinions or perhaps interviews with a handfull of experts. It's rare that you'll find answers from *thousands* of ML & DS professionals in one place - but that's what you'll find in this analysis, my friends.\n\nSo join me on this roadmap to your dream job, told in a series of heatmaps comparing the responses of professionals with different job titles in the 2020 Kaggle ML & DS Survey. This roadmap has two parts:\n* *Part 1: What is my dream job anyway?* will help you identify the dream job that fits your ML & DS interests.\n* *Part 2: How do I prepare for my dream job?* will explore the ML & DS tools and techniques used by real people who are currently working in your dream job."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 1.

Because let's face it, doing things you actually like is what makes the difference between having your dream job and just hitting the daily grind. \n\nSo let's start by looking at what real people in your dream job are actually doing at work, to help you refine your idea of what your dream job really is."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Job titles covered in this survey\n\nLet's start by looking at the job titles of the survey respondents (Question 5).
