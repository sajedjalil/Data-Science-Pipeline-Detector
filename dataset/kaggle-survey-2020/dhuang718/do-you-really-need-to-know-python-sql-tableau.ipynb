Upon looking at some job postings, I noticed a pattern: most data science related positions require skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau. I wondered, do you really need all three of these for a data science job? What if you only have one, two, three, or even none of these skills? How do these skills relate to other positions suchs as data analysts and business analysts? This is my quest: to understand the impact of having the \"trifecta\" of data science skills. \n\nIt's necessary to point out that the skills are not mutually exclusively in terms of analytics accomplished and purpose. Python can also query data just like SQL and also produce vibrant visualizations like Tableau. SQL is also a programming language but it specializes in querying and storing data and is not as multi-faceted as Python. \n\nNote: I will be referencing these skills as the \"trifecta\" because of how prevalant I've heard about them in school, job postings, and fellow students. \n\n    Short Answer:\n\nThe answer to my question of do I really need to know Python/SQL/Tableau is... yes. The distinction mostly occurs when comparing participants with a low count of skills (0 or 1 of the skills) to high count of skills (2 or 3 of the skills). Participants with a high count, generally have more of a likelihood of having a data science role, and a higher salary. \n\n    Background\nI have left my engineering role in pursuit of something more technical, data orientated, and where reasoning is powered by science. I started in January and have obtained all three skills in by May, although by all means not an expert in each. I was able to work on an internship that required heavy usage of SQL during the summer. So I have a feel for what it is like to have one of the trifecta skills. At these point, I consider myself just crossing the line from begineer to intermediate. Since data science roles are scarce, I hope to start out with a job related to data, most likely a business or data analyst, then move to data science.

I understand that there can be slight nuances going from country to country; salaries will need to be adjusted,  and job roles can vary. For simplicity, I will be concentrating on the United states of America, althought all the analysis can be easily redone for another country. \n\n2) I will drop all participants who have left question 5 (choosing title similar to current role) empty. Having an answer to this question is paramount to my analysis. \n\n3) It is helpful to drop the first column in the dataset (time used to answer survey) to greatly reduce the cpu usage. The row contains multiple datatypes so it uses alot of memory. It's also not necessary for my analysis and to prove my point. Alternatively, we can drop the first row first then change the data type of the first column to be integer. \n\n    Assumptions:\n1) Knowing Python will be expanded to having programming experience. Question 7 will be deciding question if the participant has programming experience or not. All programming experience will be grouped together. So, having R or Matlab or Python skills will be considered the same as having programming experience.\n\n2) Having SQL skills will be expanded to having big data product experience. Question 29 will be the deciding question for having experience in big data products. SQL is a big data tool. So having at least 1 skill in the question will count towards having experience in big data. \n\n3) Having Tableau skills will be expanded to having business intelligence experience. Questions 31 will be the deciding question for having experience in business intelligence tools. Tableau is a business intelligence tool so having any other BI experience will deemed equal experience.\n\n4) For questions with the possiblility to select more than one answer choice, if they are all empty, then I assume the participant has none of those items. The answer choice will be changed to 'None'."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport

For machine learning activities, such as building prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas, the greatest difference in proportions occurs whn comparing skill count group 1 to 2. \n\nFigure 5:\nWhen comparing the proportion of salary ranges from 100,000 to 199,999 for Count of Skill = 1, 2, 3 we have proportions of 0.17, 0.50, and 0.51, respectively.\n\n\n    Main Take-away:\n\nIf you want a higher chance of having a job title of Data Scientist, to perform job activities most relevant to data science, and to make a salary of 100,000 to 199,000, you have a higher chance if you have all three of the trifecta data science skills: programming, big data tools, and business intelligence tools.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 2: Demographics <a id = 'part2'></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have answered the main question of this notebook in Part 1: Analysis.

From Figure 7 we can see that men represent more than the majority in all skill groups. However, men generally make up a smaller percentage as the skill count goes down but skill count 2 and 3 are rougly similar percentages at 81% and 80% respectively. \n\nFrom what we've learned so far, we know that participants with a low skill count tend to be younger and are students, and participants with higher skill counts tend to be older and are professionals. So its interesting to see here that women make up a a larger portion at the lower skill count group than the higher skill count group. It is possible that more women are getting more interested in data science. Women have been historically underrepresented in STEM areas of study. We can also infer that women studying in STEM is more promeninent in this day and age than previous years.
