Key Results"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"More than 20,000 people were interviewed on Kaggle\n\n-\tHalf of these Kagglers are either students (26.8%), data scientists (13.9%) or software engineers (10.2%)\n-\tThe Remaining 49.1% of Kagglers are, for examples, currently not employed (8.6%) or data analysts (8.6%), etc.\n\n#### Because of students being the majority in the survey the further analysis continued based off that subgroup.\n\nMoreover, the survey results revealed that the majority of students are either from India (43.4%), USA (6.8%) or China (4%) (regardless of other (5%)). These three most representative countries are the so called *Top Three* in the underlying analysis.\n\nRegarding the age distribution of the *Top Three* the answers point out most of students (> 95%) are in the age between 18 and 29. \n\nLooking at the education level attended by the students from the *Top Three*, it can be observed based on the results most of students attend whether a bachelor's program or a master's \nprogram. These sum up to more than 84%. What is more, there are also some students who study but will not earn any academic degree (8%).\n\nThe representation of the gender is, as everyone can guess, still in favor of men. Male students are still the majority (73.4%), whereas women are represented by (24.9%) which is actually every fourth person on Kaggle regarding the *Top Three*. Hereby, we could figure out that the USA has the highest ratio in terms of women and men and amongst the *Top Three* (the other three choices have been neglected for simplicity). However, every third person is a female student who joined the Kaggle survey 2020 as an American student. That led us to the conclusion to stick to that specific subgroup for the remaining analysis. \n\n#### Insights about female students studying in the USA\n\n#### Sociodemographic data:\n\n-\tMost of female students from the USA are in the age between 25 and 29\n-\tEvery second American female student attends a master’s program \n\n#### Machine Learning and Technology:\n\n-\tRoughly, one-third of them have one to two years of programming experience. One out of every fourth student has between three to five years of experience, whereas, 2% even more than 10 years. (Also, on average a female student can handle at least two programming languages)\n-\tRegarding the most used language Python (32.2%) is a clear winner, followed by R (17.2%), and eventually by SQL (12.2%) (By the way, nearly 8 out of 10 female students recommend Python to an aspiring scientist)\n-\tThe majority uses a personal computer or laptop for data science projects; hereby, the female students use rather GPUs (32.9%) than TPUs (1.2%); that’s why most of these students have never used a TPU (88.1%)\n-\tFor visualizing/plotting the data the majority uses as library 1. Matplotlib (30.5%), 2. Ggplot/ggplot2 (19.9%) and 3. Seaborn (16.9%)\n-\tThe results indicate that the majority of female students (39%) have been using ML methods for less than one year\n-\tThe most ML algorithms in use are 1. Linear or Logistic Regression (29.5%), 2. Decision Trees or Random Forests (21.2%) and 3. Bayesian Approach (12.8%)\n-\tIn terms of computer vision categories the majority uses Image classification and other general purpose networks  or none (each 22.5%)\n-\tNLP methods mostly used are: 1. Transformer language model (31%), 2. Word embeddings/vectors (31%), 3. Encoder-Decoder models (20.7%)\n\n#### Social Media and Learning online:\n\n-\tApproximately, every fifth female student from the US acquires the needed know-how for data science in the university through courses itself, followed by Cousera (18.5%) and LinkedIn Learning (11.5%)\n-\tThe favorite media sources which are used to gain further information about data science are YouTube (1 out of 5 female students), Kaggle (16.4%) and Blogs (15.8%); only 2.4% of these students do not inform on any media source\n\n#### Endeavors of female students for the upcoming two years:\n\nIn general, the good news are that female students from the USA want to invest more time to get familiar with certain technologies regarding cloud computing, ML, big data products and more. \n\nFor instance, there is a big interest to gain more knowledge / get more familiar with cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (26.2%), Google Cloud Platform (19%) and Microsoft Azure (17.2%). Only 4.5% responded to have no interest at all. What is more, related to specific cloud computing products point out that Azure Cloud Services (14.6%), Google Cloud Compute Engine (13.4%) and Amazon EC2 (12.9%) are the most popular amongst the given choices. Here again, only 4.8% of female students indicate to not get familiar with for in the next two years.\n\nRegarding the attitude towards specific machine learning products, female students would like to get more familiar with Google Cloud AI Platform / Google Cloud ML Engine (15%) and Google Cloud Natural Language (14.1%). Products from Amazon are rather located at the end of the ranking, for instance, Amazon Forecast ranked as second last favorite (7.5%). Fortunately, only the minority (3.1%) is interested in none. \n\nRegarding big data products, we could figure out that MySQL (12.9%), MongoDB (10.8%) and Microsoft SQL Server (9.7%) are the favorite ones amongst the US female students. Products from Amazon (like Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena), IBM (like IBM Db2) or Microsoft (like Microsoft Access or Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage) are not really in favor of American female students. These are chosen by 1.8% to 2.9% of the overall female students. \n\nWhen looking at Business Intelligence tools Tableau is a clear favorite. More than every fourth student (28.6%) voted for that particular software. Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio are ranked second and third, respectively (19.3% and 13%). \nTIBCO Spotfire, Domo and Qlik are the least choices of American female students (each chosen by 1.2%). \n\nLooking at the choices for automated ML tools the picture looks as follows:\nIn particular, the majority of female students (17.1%) want to get more familiar with Automation of full ML pipelines (like Google Cloud AutoML). Automated model selection, from auto-sklearn, for instance, are chosen by 16.6% of female students, whereas Automated feature engineering/selection are chosen by 16%. Nearly every tenth female student from the US do not want to get familiar with any of these tools. \nIf students were asked about specific automated ML products, the majority is in favor of Auto-Sklearn (every fifth female student). Auto-Keras and Google Cloud AutoML are ranked second and third, respectively. \nIn order to manage ML experiments a clear favorite is TensorBoard (nearly every third female student, i.e., 28.3%). However, one out of four students (i.e., 25.3%) do not even want to get familiar with any of these managing tools. But, still Weights & Biases and Neptune.ai seem to be interesting for 14.1% and 10.1% of female students, respectively.

Conclusion"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The underlying analysis of the **2020 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey** revealed many interesting insights. \n\nAt the beginning, we tried to look for a specific subgroup which is most representative in the given survey. After filtering the *Top Three* we could get the insight that the USA has the highest ratio of women with respect to women and men, followd by India and China. After that result we continued our journey with the target group of US female students. Based on the given results we could clearly see that female students from the USA are a subgroup on Kaggle community that is on a rise to get more familiar with data science, machine learning and all the other related fields like big data products. The results revealed that every second female student from the USA attends a master's program. Moreover, the majority of them are in the age between 25 and 29 which is clearly an indication that most of them are looking for a job/PhD position in the forseeable future. What is more, the majority of that specific subgroup has only one to two years of programming experience (there is still a lot of capacity left!!). The favorite (or rather the mosed used) programming languages are Python and R.\nEven when looking at the use of TPUs and GPUs on a regular basis, the answers showed clearly that GPUs are rather in use than TPUs (maybe because they are still in the easy and perfect world of theory (=university)) for the majority of female students. The category of computer vision seem to be alos an area of less interest. Here, it would be interesting to get more insights about why that could be the case. But also the resutls reagarding the experience with the use of particular machine learning algorithms is for the majority less than one year (but as we know, all things come to those who wait). \n\nWith respect to the next two years, female students from the USA are likely to invest more time in technology, ML and other related fields. As the results show, female students are interested in cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform. But also, the interest for Business Intelligence tools seem to be big - in particular, Tableau has been revealed as a clear favorite. \nLastly, most of the results point out that the endeavors for the next two years are quite high since only the minority of these students are interested in none of several topics. \n\nThanks for taking time to read through. :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### [Back to Table](#table)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"                                                END"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
