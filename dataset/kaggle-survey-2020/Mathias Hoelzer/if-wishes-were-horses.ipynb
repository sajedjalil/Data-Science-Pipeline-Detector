Downloaded from Wikipedia.</a>\n\nMusic plays an important role in my life and I have to admit that I am a Spin Doctors fan. I do like the rhythm of most of their songs. Especially the album \"You've got to believe in something\". Great songs....\n\nOne might ask how is this connected to the survey and to the more than strange year of 2020 with most of us locked down and at home?\n\nThe answer is quite simple. End of year is always a time for wishes and plans for the next year, so I came across with the supplementary questions in the 2020 survey which give a projection of the future plans of survey participants.\n\nDriving question is: **Are there trends to be identified in the plans of Non-Profesionals when it comes to future learings?**\n\nMy initial guess was yes there is and that there would be some slight shifts to better and more efficient tools. However the final answer is a little bit more complex.\n\nSo let's start the journey..."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import plot, iplot, init_notebook_mode\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Input data\n\nFirst of course the input data need to be taken into the Notebook.

For Big Data products, namly data bases MongoDB is gaining more and more interest and it is worth give this database a try and lern how to use.\n\nBusiness Intelligence tools are interesting and a good interlink to the next level in the hierachy. Bower BI and Tableau are still the first choice for Business Intelligence tools, but Google is on a rise as well. \n\nThe most interesting part of the analysis is for the end. Automated ML tools and ML Management tools. Here the Next Generation Data Scientists can make a huge difference and boost their carrier in my opinion. Mainly because the current Data Science community is not using nor implementing these tools in a mayority.\n\nFor Automated ML tools the field is huge and there is no clear trend which will be the number one choice in the next years, so it might be worth looking into all of them.\n\nFor ML management tools the trend seems to lean towards TensorBoard.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
