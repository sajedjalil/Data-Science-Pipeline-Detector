EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n### Context \n\nAs outlined within the [Kaggle introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/overview): \"the survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 20,036 responses\".\n\nMembership of the community implies either having already some data science skills, or at least a willingness to observe, learn from, network with those who have.\n\n**NOTE**: \n1. this notebook contains charts that are generated dynamically- to see all the charts (e.g. radar chart comparing countries), please open the notebook and select \"run all\"\n2. if you download the notebook, at the end of this section, within the environment initialization, you will find also the option to use a local copy of the CSV containing the Kaggle results, and you will be able to run locally, and export the resulting document either as HTML (suggested) or PDF\n3. if you select to download and run locally, within the environment initialization at the end of this section you can also set\n<code>\n    kagglestorysaveimages = True\n</code>\n\nBy setting that value, when you \"run all\" the notebook will try to create a subdirectory \"images\" (if not present), and will save:\n* all the results of \"print\" into a text file\n* all the non-plotly charts as SVG files clearly labelled with the section they are produced from\n* all the plotly charts as HTML files clearly labelled with the section they are produced from, files that can be opened in any browser and will dinamycally reproduce the chart \"as is\", i.e. as saved \n\nAll these options are to enable exporting the full documentation and reproduce the results, and have been tested on a Debian 10 with Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.7.3 on 2021-01-05\n\n### Focus adopted\n\nMy use of the [Kaggle survey results dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data) is <u>focused on identifying some potential trends on the bridging between data science and business, notably on the management side</u>.\n\nTo that end, selected people whose job title typically requires interacting with \"business domain specialists\" and decision-makers, ***Business Analyst*** and **Product/Project Manager***.\n\nThis is because, since the 1980s, in successive rounds of \"new data-based decision-making\" in business organizations, observed that only when awareness is widespread, and use eventually (at different degrees of expertise) is within the direct circle of decision-makers, and not just in a closed self-referential technical group, a technology is adopted.\n\nAs an example, in the 1980s Decision Support Systems were probably too technical and too complex, and embraced by managers in their 30s, at a time when more senior managers did not even use personally a PC.\n\nIn the 1990s, business intelligence tools (now widespread) lowered the \"knowledge bar\", by enabling also intuitive data investigation, and expanding on visualizations that were both easy to obtain, and business-relevant.\n\nBut it all starts with people, not technology.\n\nTherefore, this report is a comparative analysis between three countries (or aggregations thereof) that:\n* represent different market concepts\n* have a different mix of respondents (age, education background, etc)\n* have number of respondents in the same order of magnitude.\n\nAfter an initial check across all the countries contained within the dataset, therefore three countries have been selected:\n* Europe (as aggregation of countries geographically in Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, not just the European Union, as anyway not all the European Union contries are explicitly represented within the survey dataset)\n* India\n* United States of America (sometimes referenced within the commentary as \"USA\").\n\n### Preliminary results\n\nThe analysis started by reading the Executive Summary released by Kaggle, and then reviewing other material, to confirm the focus of the report.\n\nIn early January 2021, while preparing the report, decided to replace as source of reference other documents with a new report produced in June 2020 by McKinsey on the \"State of AI\", and focused on the business impacts side, that confirmed some elements within the analysis.\n\nUnfortunately, those data are not available, just the Executive Summary, and therefore I added the link under *\"References\"* later in this section.\n\nAs discussed within the report, this notebook is just a first phase, as more advanced analyses will be carried out in the future.\n\nThe purpose was to share a feed-back on what is inside the dataset, and suggest which other data (or integration with other data sources) might be useful, within the focus shown above.\n\nThe key section of this report, to understand what follows, is the (mainly non-technical) ***Section B. ASSUMPTIONS AND CHOICES***, where choices both about data and structure of the report are presentd.\n\nFrom the analysis of the data, some <u>first results</u> (see ***Section E. DATA ANALYSIS*** for more details):\n* the three countries cover 11,992 respondents out of 20,036, i.e. 59.50% of the respondents to the survey\n* across the job titles of Business Analyst and Product/Project Manager, the three countries cover 898 respondents out of 1,490, i.e. 60.3% of the respondents to the survey \n* by focusing on Business Analysts and Product/Project Managers (898 out of 11,992, i.e. 7.5%), the gender gap is even greater than on the Executive Summary by Kaggle, i.e. the higher up the decision-making chain, the more \"gender equality\" is lacking- also in Europe, despite all the \"positive bias\" initiatives adopted since the beginning of the XXI century\n* the audience (members of Kaggle) is obviously biased, showing at least interest into the machine learning domain, but nonetheless the differences between the three countries selected in demographics and company they work for are a confirmation of what is observed routinely also in other surveys on the general IT population\n* nowhere there is a strong correlation (positive or negative) between the roles selected and the other questions, albeit, after identifying the average correlation for the three countries, there are differences that might be worth further investigation.\n\nAreas of further investigation that, based upon the results, identified:\n* explore the differences, and try to identify patterns at least for the three questions that show the higher level of difference (Q32, Q24, Q20) for the roles selected\n* verify if those patterns apply also to the community of respondents at large, or are just an indication, due to the job titles selected, applying just to the three countries\n* for Europe, as the subdivision in countries is present, identify if the above mentioned patterns show differences\n* also, would like to see if these differences are matched by differences vs. UN SDG for both the three \"macro-countries\" and the individual European countries.\n\n\n### Structure of the report\n\nThe report is composed by just one long notebook, and some files reproducing its contents, charts, results for comparison and reproducibility purposes.\n\nBy the end of January 2021, a PDF version will be added to the files.\n\nThe structure of this report:\n* A. Executive Summary\n* B. Assumptions and Choices\n* C. Dimensions of Analysis (data selection)\n* D. Data Preparation\n* E. Data Analysis\n* F. Appendix\n\nSection B contains the focus adopted and the production process, while Section C contains the data selection criteria.\n\nSection D prepares the data for further use, creating different aggregations.\n\nSection E is the core of the report:\n* first discussing each one of the features selected (16 columns out of 355)\n* then identifying why some are not relevant to the focus of this report\n* on those selected to remain, a correlation analysis\n* finally, based upon the results, listing the other potential areas of future investigation that I would like to follow, e.g. checking if any pattern is also consistent with patterns within the UN SDGs, notably for individual European countries (already posted on Kaggle datasets on UN SDGs, as part of another ongoing publication project, on [my kaggle profile](https://kaggle.com/robertolofaro).\n\nWithin Section F, I enclosed my notes/quotes from the two reports listed within the references.\n\n\n### References\n\nOut of many more documents, I considered as a reference for the analysis two reports:\n* [Kaggle's executive summary PDF](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2020), containing the above mentioned 20,036 responses (retrieved and read 2019-11-20) \n* [McKinsey's \"Global Survey - The State of AI in 2020\"](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-the-state-of-ai-in-2020), carried out between 2020-06-09 and 2020-06-19, containing 2,395 responses, pag. 13: \"representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures.

AI to avoid facing yet another [**\"AI Winter\"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) has to become part of the *\"new normal\"* that the convergence of [**\"Digital Transformation\"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation), accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic side-effects, is delivering.\n\n2. The transformation will affect both society and businesses, but I will focus on the business side.\n\n3. What I observed since the 1980s is that technology, to become embedded in businesses, needs:\n\n>a **mandate**, or at least (for initiatives started from the bottom of an organization, as spontaneous experiments, and not as initiatives, programmes, etc from the top) clear sponsorship from decision-makers\n\n>adequate **resources** (budget, but also infrastructure and integration within the ordinary budget of e.g. business units or corporate ICT)\n\n>last but not least, **talent** , i.e. an environment that attracts, retains, develops human resources, and spreads awareness across the whole organization.\n\n***THEMES SELECTED***\n\nAfter reading the Survey Executive Summary report and reviewing the data, the following selection criterias have been applied to choose which data (questions) should be used in the analysis:\n* identifying people\n* defining the organizations they work for\n* identifying the level of adoption of data-based decision-making (not just AI- also Business Intelligence, as e.g. Microsoft PowerBI allows integration also with R and Python)\n\n***POPULATION SELECTION***\n\nThese are the **job titles present within the dataset**:\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\r\\n===> SECTION B.

Companies earning the most from AI plan to invest\neven more in response to COVID-19—and perhaps widen the gap\nwith others.\"\n\n**page 2**\n\n\"Overall, half of respondents say their organizations\nhave adopted AI in at least one function\n\nAI adoption was about equal across regions last\nyear, this year’s respondents working for companies\nwith headquarters in Latin American countries and\nin other developing countries are much less likely\nthan those elsewhere to report that their companies\nhave embedded AI into a process or product in at\nleast one function or business unit. By industry,\nrespondents in the high-tech and telecom sectors 2\nare again the most likely to report AI adoption, with\nthe automotive and assembly sector falling just\nbehind them (down from sharing the lead last year).\n\nThe business functions in which organizations\nadopt AI remain largely unchanged from the 2019\nsurvey, with service operations, product or service\ndevelopment, and marketing and sales again taking\nthe top spots\"\n\n\n**page 2**\n\n\"The use cases\nthat most commonly led to cost decreases are\noptimization of talent management, contact-center\nautomation, and warehouse automation\"\n\n**page 4**\n\n\"This year we asked about adoption of deep\nlearning—a type of machine learning that uses\nneural networks and can sometimes deliver superior\nresults—for the first time. Just 16 percent of\nrespondents say their companies have taken deep\nlearning beyond the piloting stage. Once again, high-\ntech and telecom companies are leading the charge,\nwith 30 percent of respondents from those sectors\nsaying their companies have embedded deep-\nlearning capabilities.\"\n\nfrom the comment from Micheael Chui, partner, McKinsey Global Institute, San Francisco \" However, there\nwas a bit of a decrease in bullishness this\nyear, perhaps reflecting the passing of\nAI’s hype phase. We do think AI is worth\nthe investment, but it requires effective\nexecution to generate significant value,\nparticularly at enterprise scale.\"\n\nBeside the usual concepts about performance and leadership attuned (up to championing IA initiatives directly from the C-suite), as in other past technological waves I witnessed since the 1980s, it is not just a matter of budgets, or share of the ICT budget, but it is a matter of internalizing skills and mindset.\n\n**page 5**\n\n\"High performers also\ntend to have the ability to develop AI solutions\nin-house—as opposed to purchasing solutions—\nand they typically employ more AI-related talent,\nsuch as data engineers, data architects, and\ntranslators, than do their counterparts. They\nalso are much more likely than others to say their\ncompanies have built a standardized end-to-\nend platform for AI-related data science, data\nengineering, and application development.\"\n\nfrom commentary by Bryce Hall, associate partner, Washington DC: \"Many executives now realize that\nAI solutions typically need to be developed\nor adapted in close collaboration with busi-\nness users to address real business needs\nand enable adoption, scale, and real value\ncreation. As a result, we see companies\nincreasingly developing a bench of AI\ntalent and launching training programs to\nraise the overall analytics acumen across\ntheir organizations.\"\n\nOther dimensions are discussed in the report, e.g. the risks associated with AI.\n\nWhich cover reputational but also business risks, such as misuse of recommendation systems in business decision-making that is base: which converges with the current drive toward ensuring transparency via explainability in terms understandable to business users\n\nunfortunately, as noted by Roger Burkhardt, partner, new york on page 10: \"Overall, however, the results are\nconcerning. While some risks, such as\nphysical safety, apply to only particular\nindustries, it’s difficult to understand why\nuniversal risks aren’t recognized by a much\nhigher proportion of respondents. \"\n\nand adds a curious side-effect, probably linked to the paradigms used, e.g. learning from the past, in a time (the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated phases of universal business lockdown) when the drivers of past performance of a business are not relevant: \"Generally, respondents from companies that have\nadopted more AI capabilities are more likely to report\nseeing AI models misperform amid the COVID-19\npandemic than others are. Responses indicate\nthat high-performing organizations, which tend to\nhave adopted more AI capabilities than others, are\nwitnessing more misperformance than companies\nseeing less value from AI. These high-performing\norganizations’ models were particularly vulnerable\nwithin marketing and sales, product development,\nand service operations (Exhibit 6)—the areas where\nAI adoption is most commonly reported.\"\n\n**data reported on page 12**\n\n\"\nRespondents from AI high performers most often say their models have\nmisperformed within the business functions where AI is used the most.\n32% Marketing and sales\n21% Product and/or service development \n19% Service operations\n\n**page 13, methodology**\n\n\"\nThe online survey was in the field from June 9 to\nJune 19, 2020, and garnered responses from 2,395\nparticipants representing the full range of regions,\nindustries, company sizes, functional specialties,\nand tenures. Of those respondents, 1,151 said their\norganizations had adopted AI in at least one function\nand were asked questions about their organizations’\nAI use. To adjust for differences in response rates,\nthe data are weighted by the contribution of each\nrespondent’s nation to global GDP.
