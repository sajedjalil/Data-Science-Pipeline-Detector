Then the slider may not be the most optimum method to update our plot. In that case we can use drop down menu to select the particular frame of data that we are interested to visualise. This can get a little complicated, but there are two componenets that we need to understand to be able to use it effectively. \n\n1. graph objects\n2. fig.add_trace() and buttons\n\n### Graph Objects:\nAt a low level, we can think of figures as represented by dictionary and displayed using the fig.show() function. This is what we have been doing so far, where we created dictionary values of figures and updated that dictionary with new values.\n\nThe[ plotly.graph_objects](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.graph_objects.html) module lets us generate an automatically generated hierarchy of classes called 'Graph Objects'. They offer several benefits compared to plain python dictionaries, see [\"When to use Graph Objects\"](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/) to learn more about them.\n\n### Adding traces:\nNew traces can be added to graph objects using the add_trace() method, which accepts a graph object trace 9an instance of go.Scatter, go.Bar, etc.) and adds it to the figure. This allows us to start with an empty figure and add traces to it sequentially. \n\n\n**To begin with we will group our data to explore just the questions we are interested in.**\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"age_groups = df[['Q6', 'Q3', 'measure']].groupby(['Q6','Q3']).sum().reset_index()\ncountries = []\nfig=go.Figure()\nbuttons = []\ndefault = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'\n\nfor country in age_groups.Q3.value_counts().index:\n    temp = age_groups[age_groups.Q3 == country]\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=temp['Q6'], y=temp['measure'], visible=(country==default)))\n    countries.extend([country])\n\nfor country in age_groups.Q3.value_counts().index:\n    buttons.append(dict(method='update',\n                        label=country,\n                        args = [{'visible': [country==r for r in countries]}]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the code that generates the following plot has two for loops.\n\n```\nfor country in age_groups.Q3.value_counts().index:\n    temp = age_groups[age_groups.Q3 == country]\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=temp['Q6'], y=temp['measure'], visible=(country==default)))\n    countries.extend([country])\n```\nThe first loop will go through every options we want to set in our dropdown, essentially we are trying to filter our data for each option and add the trace to our graph object.\n\n```\nfor country in age_groups.Q3.value_counts().index:\n    buttons.append(dict(method='update',\n                        label=country,\n                        args = [{'visible': [country==r for r in countries]}]))\n```\nThe second loop creates button values for each of the traces that we sequentially created in the previous loop.
