Find your job needs, build up and stick to 4-5 skills as your core 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 to make yourself unique and standout. But don't forget to be open-minded and have some knowledge on other things\n* Engage with the community and interact with others by sharing your work and learning from others, it is all-time important!\n\n### Important Things To Note ⭐⭐⭐\n* Having at least a Master's degree is important for data-related jobs, but it's becoming less important.\n* Know Python 🐍, learn 🐍, master 🐍, and integrate 🐍 with the other languages you regularly use to build a network 🕸️ in your brain 🧠.\n* Free services like Google Colab and Kaggle Notebook are the must to know, but don't completely ignore pay services like Amazon Sagemaker because pay 💰 means better experiences and better quality, and it might be closer to the industry needs.\n* Visalization is intended to be used to deliver people's thoughts, which is beyond being fancy. It could be simple or complicate and it could be built using any tool/packages (Tableau|Matplotlib|Seaborn|Ggplot|...). However, it must be easy to understand and interactive ✨. \n\n### When You Consider A Higher Annual Compensation ❗❗❗\n* Career experience is the most important aspect\n    - One needs to know how to drive large business impacts using data and their skills.\n    - One needs to know how to build things in large scale by knowing what different scales of companies or data teams are doing 👶-🧒-🧑🏼. \n* Skillsets and abilities is the 2nd important aspect\n    - Plotly is strongly recommended! Or any other interactive package also works. And don't forget to know how to put it in production 📱.\n    - Get to know and apply more ides, languages, visualizations, and machine learning frameworks whenever needed.\n* p.s. If you are having a data job in the United States, you've been on the pirate boat ⚓-💰.\n\n\n### Here I collected my findings from the analysis. Help me check it out, tell me what you think and whether they are ✔️ or ❌ with your understandings. \n* People age from 18 to 34 act as more active learners. More specifically, once they dive into a new area or career, they grow and learn really fast in the first 5 years.\n* Data Scientists market lowers the bar of higher formal education (Master's or Doctor's) and become more open to Bachelor's degrees. However, Data Scientists with Master's degrees still take up the majority part of the market, which is 51.14% in 2020.\n* The most regularly used language is still Python 🐍 and it's the one Kagglers think most important, no matter if they use it. People tend to use python with other one or two languages as a language combo. Popular combos are (Python|SQL), (Python|R), (Python|SQL|R), and (Python|C|C++). However, what's interesting is that for analytics (people using one of Python, R, or SQL), some think Python is very important but some think it is not at all.\n* Popular two notebook platforms are Google Colab and Kaggle Notebook (ps. this is Kaggle survey anyway 🤷🏼). Both the experienced and students like to use them 🆓! As for Amazon Sagemaker, compared with students who almost don't use it at all, a lot more experienced people use it 💰. \n* Data Scientists' favorite visualization tools are Seaborn | Ggplot | Plotly | Shiny | Bokeh | Leaflet/Folium. These packages have things in common: easthetical, easy-to-use, interactive. Especially for plotly ✨, comparing with other jobs, data scientists have more than 10% of people using it.\n* For machine learning and deep learning techniques in general, on average, Kagglers gain 1 skill/working year and tend to become stable after 4-5 years working experience. For more advanced techniques like Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, people learn 1-2 skills in the first 5 years and stick with it across the career.\n* Job responsibilities can be categorized into three: analytics, machine learning R&D, and pipeline/architecture. Jobs define which job responsibility you should treat more importantly. However, if you are data scientists, machine learning engineers, or research scientists, you will take multiple responsibilities. \n* The cost on Machine learning and cloud services is positively correlated to the company size 🏦, the data science team size 👥, and the company's stage of machine learning developements 🌘🌗🌒. More specifically, compared with other jobs, data scientists have the highest willingness to spend money on these services.\n* Top1 platform to share work is Github. Machine learning engineers, data scientists, and data engineers have higher willingness to share work on platforms while students and the unemployeed don't share work at all. \n* The top3 course platforms are Coursera, Kaggle Learn Course, and Udemy, having 18%, 12.5%, and 12% of users, respectively. Cloud-certification Programs and Fast.ai are the two platforms having least users, which is only 2.5%.\n* The top3 media sources are Kaggle, Youtube, and blogs. Students prefer the more entertaining media type like Youtube while the experienced prefer various of readable and interactive media like Kaggle and blogs."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Understanding\n* Data science is everywhere and it has been the sexiest job all over the world.
