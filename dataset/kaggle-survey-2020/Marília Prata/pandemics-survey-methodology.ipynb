Uncertainty, school and business closings, economic vulnerability and job loss have been some results of the lockdowns. Why not  Kaggle Survey 2020 wouldn't present little changes?\n\nSchools/Universities were closed during each country lockdown. Students remained at home studying on-line. That was possible only for those that have access to internet. Many in low-income or in vulnerability situation simply couldn't proceed their courses. For them, 2020 is a year pratically lost.\n\nWomen were also more affected? They had to stay home, taking care of their children. And many lose their jobs too.\n\nHave a peek at those charts and get some insights of what had changed between 2018-2020.\n\n\n#An Overview of the Pandemic's effects on Kagglers Education, Age, Gender and Salary.\n\nLet the charts speak for themselves. In other words, readers make your own Conclusions."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#I think even Kaggle Bot (Kerneler) got Covid-19. It should wear a Mask.
