Also to highlight that the title of the notebook, is trying to convey a few hints (or messages):\n    \n- the outreach of Kaggle as a community and what the maintainers ARE doing to reach out, and support\n- the outreach of Kaggle as a community and what the maintainers COULD be doing to sustain and support the existing Data Science / Machine Learning community\n- also what could be done to include those in the wing who are not participating but can be reached out\n\nAs in my view, survey processes and the responses received from them act as a pulse about the community at different points in time - they are a great way to do community-health checks. Because the quality of the data gathered from such an action will depend on this factor and will also be reflected throughout the process and in the data collected. In our case, the metrics are going to be super helpful to throw light on such and other insights.\n\nThe views and opinions I'm making are solely based on a constrained framework and the condition that the data we have collected may be reflecting only a portion of the Data Science and Machine Learning world out there (the little we know from what we receive as responses). And it is down to us to further prove or disprove these arguments and conjectures. So the analysis and conclusions may have limitations outside the context of this framework or condition. I'm also indirectly eluding to presence of bias in the results/outcome/interpretations from the data, which we will see through the following sections of the report (the different angles and lenses drawn out in the rest of the notebook).\n\nI agree that this approach is a *bit meta* as we are using the survey metrics (not just the data gathered by the survey) to make analysis, assessments and conclusions about the survey itself and how this can be changed or improved at the same time assessing the current community and the future participants of the community."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.04053,"end_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:37.775455","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:37.734925","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.042759,"end_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:37.85929","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:37.816531","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='summary'></a>\n\n----------\n> ## <div class=\"subsection_title\">Summary\n>\n> - We sifted through many survey responses datasets, preprocessed them and merged them to create a combined dataset and further combined it with other datasets to enrich the existing information gathered by the survey activities.\n> - Several countries across the six continents of **Asia**, **Africa**, **Europe**, **the Americas** and **Oceania (Australia and New Zealand)** participated in providing feedback since **2017** through to **2020**.\n> - Looking at the metrics from the Survey responses shows how vibrant the community is and how they have spent time and have been engaged for a long time learning and contributing back. Further they show that there are new comers who are rising fast and the veterans and mid-aged are slowing down and these are more than a handful of countries in the two or three groups.

You will see countries in the **African** and **Middle-Eastern** regions are generally doing well, closely followed by **Asia** and **South America**. These all fall under the **Developed** and **Developed/Developing** categories.\n> - Unfortunately or maybe due to economic cycles, participations from the **Developed** countries across the board are not on a growth trajectory and as we know a lot of exchanges take place between the **Developed** countries and rest of the world so it would be good to find out the reason(s) behind the decline in the participation. These might just be early signals leading to something else.\n> - Many countries that have NOT been represented in the survey responses since the beginning, even though some of them might have participated in the Kaggle forums in some form or shape (may not as a registered member). And it would be good to reach out to them to find out the reason(s) for their absence. Maybe they don't know about Kaggle or there isn't enough support or incentives for them to come forward. You can find these countries mentioned and listed in the <a href='#active_or_not_on_kaggle'>3. Which countries are NOT yet on Kaggle's world map?</a> section down below in the notebook.\n> - We may almost have no contact or feedback or signals from the **Less/Under Developed** countries contributing to the surveys -- I haven't looked into this in detail so I could be wrong about it but different aspects of the analysis show it nevertheless.

Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of Asia](#survey_metrics_asia)\n- [b. Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of Europe](#survey_metrics_europe)\n- [c. Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of Oceania](#survey_metrics_oceania)\n- [d. Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of Africa](#survey_metrics_africa)\n- [e. Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of North America](#survey_metrics_north_america)\n- [f. Survey response metrics from countries in the continent of South America](#survey_metrics_south_america)\n- and all other dependent tables and graphs that draw information or make conclusions based on the data from the above changed sections\n\nAs already mentioned and explained in the [Overall conclusion](#overallConclusion) section that if a change of this nature was to come about, it wouldn't change the long-term or even medium-term outlook (the big-picture still remains intact). Although we could see a handful of countries (at worst a continent or two) change positions. These changes can be seen when comparing the outputs of this version with that of [version 26](https://www.kaggle.com/neomatrix369/kaggle-global-outreach-analysis?scriptVersionId=51423441). In short, there have been changes of a few (+/-) percentage points across a handful of countries, which have impacted metrics both at region and continent levels only mildly, but the overall big-picture conclusions remain the same."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.037631,"end_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:39.713022","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:39.675391","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='questions'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## <div class=\"subsection_title\">Answering questions with the dataset "},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.035247,"end_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:39.785906","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-05T12:02:39.750659","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='responses_stats'></a>\n\n----------\n\n### <div class=\"subsubsection_title\"> 1.

Also the proportion of Kaggle members responding to the survey compared to the total number of registered Kaggle members is a significantly low figure (a very big difference). For each year these numbers are **0.2803%**, **0.3997%**, **0.3302%** and **0.3343%** for the years **2017**, **2018**, **2019**, and **2020** respectively. There could be many reasons for this and it would be good to investigate this as it's a recurring event. Another question that comes up immediately with regards to the above, since the ratios are such small, can we say that the sample is representative of the Data Science/Machine Learning community at large or even on Kaggle, this remains to be seen. And maybe for myself or others to provide some more reasoning or reports on this.

Note that the list of countries shown here may vary from the official (and exhaustive) list, although we might be fairly close to it. This is just for illustration purposes and we don't need to be accurate (may contain mistakes encountered during the data collection and preprocessing stages) but they give us a ballpark figure and some starting point to work from.\n\nWe will see this from the perspective of each country's development status.

One thing about _Development Status_, it's clear mostly who the **Developed** and **Less/Under Developed** countries are more or less, although there is no such thing as a clear distinction between **Developed** and **Developing** countries. Different organisations can label some of the newly graduated **Developed** countries as **Developing** while others consider them as **Developed**. To avoid these confusions and ambiguity, in all such cases such countries have been assigned the _Development Status_ of **Developed/Developing**. There is still a chance to find a few countries with a slightly different _Development Status_ when going through other corpora of information about countries of the world.

Otherwise the three big nations i.e. **Canada**, **USA** and **Mexico** have been participants since the beginning, although declining in participation. Same goes for **Oceania**, with an extra 30-odd countries under it, they are independent island countries around the continent of **Australiasia**.

You must have already read about them in this section <a href=#growing_and_retreating>3. Which countries are growing in participations and which ones are retreating?</a> (subsections <a href=#growing_in_participation>a. Countries growing in participation (rising stars)</a> and <a href=#retreating>b. Countries retreating (mid-aged and veterans)</a>).
