Every discoveries and inventions are for the sole purpose of making our lives easier and better. With smart devices such as Alexa, you don't even need to get up to switch off the lights or to turn on the music. As new inventions are born, the old ones slowly fades away from existence.\n\nThe discovery of new scientific methods, algorithms and the invention of new and powerful hardwares have increased the popularity of Data Science. At present, Data Science(DS) is one among the most used words. So, *what is Data Science and what is the need for such a field of study?* \n\nIn simple words, **Data Science** is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. As the world progressed into an era of big data, data started into pour in at tremendous rates and a lot of focus turned to storing these huge data volumes. Also, it was impossible to properly label or structure all these data due to their immense volume. So, today, most of stored data are kept as either unstructured or semistructured as shown in the following figure.\n\n![data](https://miro.medium.com/max/893/1*JeIC6PreHjgh06w3WqkXMA.jpeg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The figure highlights the growth of data over the past few years. It was no longer possible to manually look at the data and predict the trend or learn about it. As the data grew at an exponential pace, the demand for tools to process these huge piles of data surged.\n\nThe large volume of unstructured data required more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it. **Data Science was the answer to this problem!** The idea of Data Science came into existence before 2000s, but it is only recently that, with the discovery of new algorithms and analytical tools and huge data volumes that, Data Science has gained all the popularity.\n\nMarked as the **highest paying job** in the year 2016 by **Glassdoor**, the field of Data science has witnessed an immense growth in recent years. Employers are in the search of data scientists more than ever. A report by **Indeed** indicated a 29% increase in the demand of data scientists in a year.\n\nIs the situation the same today, or was the demand for Data Science short-lived? This study is to find more about that from the Kaggle survey data as well as to learn the present trends seen in the field now.\n\n![DS_Demand](https://www.thebluediamondgallery.com/wooden-tile/images/demand.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport math\nimport warnings\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D\nfrom bokeh.layouts import row, layout\nfrom bokeh.transform import transform\nfrom bokeh.transform import factor_cmap\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook, output_file\nfrom bokeh.palettes import Cividis256\nfrom bokeh.models import LabelSet, ColumnDataSource, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar, BasicTicker, FactorRange\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource\nfrom bokeh.models.widgets import DataTable, TableColumn\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\noutput_notebook()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"multiplechoice_17 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2017/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', low_memory=False, encoding='ISO-8859-1')\nmultiplechoice_18 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2018/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', low_memory= False)\nmultiplechoice_19 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv', low_memory= False)\nmultiplechoice_20 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv', low_memory= False)\n\nmultiplechoice_18.columns = [x.split('_')[0] for x in list(multiplechoice_18.columns)]\nmultiplechoice_19.columns = [x.split('_')[0] for x in list(multiplechoice_19.columns)]\nmultiplechoice_20.columns = [x.split('_')[0] for x in list(multiplechoice_20.columns)]\n\nmultiplechoice_18.columns = multiplechoice_18.columns + '_' + multiplechoice_18.iloc[0]\nmultiplechoice_19.columns = multiplechoice_19.columns + '_' + multiplechoice_19.iloc[0]\nmultiplechoice_20.columns = multiplechoice_20.columns + '_' + multiplechoice_20.iloc[0]\nmultiplechoice_18 = multiplechoice_18.drop([0])\nmultiplechoice_19 = multiplechoice_19.drop([0])\nmultiplechoice_20 = multiplechoice_20.drop([0])\n\nmultiplechoice_18['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_18['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].astype('float')\nmultiplechoice_19['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_19['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].astype('float')\nmultiplechoice_20['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_20['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].astype('float')\n\nmultiplechoice_18['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_18['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].apply(lambda x:x/3600)\nmultiplechoice_19['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_19['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].apply(lambda x:x/3600)\nmultiplechoice_20['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'] = multiplechoice_20['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].apply(lambda x:x/3600)\n\ntime_18 = str(round(multiplechoice_18['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].median()*60, 1)) + ' min'\ntime_19 = str(round(multiplechoice_19['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].median()*60, 2)) + ' min'\ntime_20 = str(round(multiplechoice_20['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)_Duration (in seconds)'].median()*60, 2)) + ' min'\n\nTOOLS=\"pan,wheel_zoom,zoom_in,zoom_out,undo,redo,reset,tap,save\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1e6dcd0fe598aa2097606052941caf188f46b048"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From 2017, **Kaggle**, one of the biggest online community of data scientists and machine learning practioners, have been conducting an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning.

Out of all the respondents, almost 50% of them live in India. Eventhough India has been one of the worst affected countries by the pandemic, data science did manage to thrive there. Apart from the survey, Indians are comparitively more active in Kaggle competitions as well (even in this one). \n\n\n* USA is one of the countries that shows the declining demand for the field. The number of survey respondents has dropped a lot, with the count going down even further every year, from 2017 to 2020. The same trend can also be seen in case of UK and France, even though the decline is not as much as in the United States.\n\n\n* On the other hand, the survey responses from India rocketed up throughout the years. The number of respondents has went up from around 25% in 2017 to 50% in 2020 which is very large compared to other countries. This higlights the increasing demand for DS in India. Japan and Brazil also follow a similar trend with the number of respondents rising every year.\n\n\n* The demand for DS has stayed constant in Canada during 2017 - 2019, but went down in 2020. We can assume pandemic might be the one to blame for the decline in 2020.\n\n\n* The other interesting case is that of China. China had a huge surge of people getting into DS between 2017 and 2018 but surprisingly that number has been on decline since then.\n\n\n> Data science is present globally and that can be seen from the survey participants from over 50 countries. It is hard to jump to a conclusion about the demand for data science globally. In certain countries like India, the field seems to blossom, while in USA and China it doesn't look that good. Even the pandemic might have a say on this, especially in the year 2020.\n\n\n\nIndia and USA are the countries with most number of respondents (around 70%).

Most of the other respondents are those with Bachelor's degree. They together make up over 75% of the total respondents, which is huge!!!. So it is **important to have atleast a Bachelor's degree** to easily become a part of DS community\n\n\n* As seen in the analysis of age group of respondents, over 50% of the them are below the age of 30. That might be so because, people start to enter DS after completing either the Bachelor's or Master's. Also the bachelor's community have seen a good growth especially in 2020 while the master's community suffered a loss in its share of percentages. \n\n\n* This change in percentages of bachelor's and master's group can be inferred as because of more people under 25 getting into data science (as seen from above section) in 2020 and the also due to lesser number of people above 25 and in middle-age group in the same year as compared to 2019.\n\n\n* There is a good percentage (about 15%) of respondents that have a Doctoral degree but the drop in the chart in 2020 isn't a good sign. According to the [census](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/02/number-of-people-with-masters-and-phd-degrees-double-since-2000.html) by U.S. Census Bureau, there are only 4.5 million people with Doctoal degree in US in 2018 comapred to around 70 million of them with either Bachelors or Masters. **The 15% percentage of respondents with Doctoral degree is definitely an indicator that it is, a lot more easier to land in a DS job with a Doctoral degree**.\n\n\n* For those people without a degree, the change for getting into data science is quite small. So, generally the higher the degree you have, more likely you are to end up in DS job.\n\n\n> The key takeaway is that you can start a career with just a Bachelor's degree and learn more as you work. It is always better to learn from real world experiences at your workplace. Pursuing a higher degree is also great and will eventually make it easier to get better jobs and pay. It is clear from the previous section that more young people are into kaggle and DS and hence the large number of Bachelor's community.

Data Storage**\n\nThe most important part of Data Science is the data itself! As more and more data started to pour in, the need for better data storage became important. Databases support this requirement and provides an interface where the data can be stored in a structured manner(in case of RDBMS). \n\nIn simple terms, a database is an organized collection of data. To work with database, you need a DBMS(Database Management System) which is a software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database. Like found in the above section, SQL is one among the most used and recommended languages and learning such a database manipulation language is a necessary and an important skill required for data scientists.

MongoDB is a non-relational, document oriented database management system and works on document based database. The usage of MongoDB is almost the same among all experience groups.\n\n\n* **MySQL is the most used DBMS** which is then followed by PostgresSQL and MS SQL Server. According to the [survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020/#technology) conducted by stack overflow, the top three DBMS among developers are MySQL, PostgresSQL and MS SQL Server. PostgreSQL is gaining lots of traction in the last few years. Developers working with Postgres are very pleased with the product, both in terms of capabilities and performance.\n\n\n* As experience rises, the dependency on MySQL drops. The usage of Postgres and MS SQL Server are found to be increasing with the increase in experience.

Can Data Science be moved into the cloud?**\n\nCloud services is a rapidly growing market. Modern technologies like big data analytics, IoT, artificial intelligence and even web and mobile app hosting requires heavy computing power. Cloud computing offers enterprises an alternative to building their in-house infrastructure. **With cloud computing, anybody using the internet can enjoy scalable computing power on a plug and play basis**. This saves organizations from the need to invest and maintain costly infrastructure, and hence has become a very popular solution. \n\nApart from just the oraganizational point of view, cloud resources are also useful for us developers. With new hardwares coming out every few months, it is difficult to keep our local machines updated. The cloud solutions saves you time and money from investing on these modern hardwares. Many of us frequently use cloud resources such as Google Colab or Kaggle notebooks for conducting various studies or analyses and that too at free of cost.

Most of the other cloud platforms are hardly used. When observing the cloud platforms apart from Big 3 of AWS, GCP and Azure, you can find that as people have larger coding experience, they seldom prefer other cloud platforms apart from the Big 3. These platform are cheaper compared to the Big 3 and also provides a lot of features similar to that found in Big 3. That might be one of the reasons behind why they are chosen by the people having lesser experience (more likely the ones with lesser annual compensation as well).\n\n\n* AWS seems to be the best in the market and is a lot more popular among the experienced compared to its competitors GCP and Azure. Under AWS, Amazon provides on-demand cloud computing platforms like storage, data analysis, etc and also allows their subscribers to enjoy a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, at any time, based on their requirements. The entire service is enabled through the internet. AWS's virtual cloud platform comes with most of the attributes of an actual computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, hard-disk/SSD for storage & local/RAM for memory), an operating system to choose from and pre-loaded apps like web servers, databases, CRM, etc.\n\n\n* GCP seems to be equally popular among people with all sorts of experience. GCP offers services in all major spheres including compute, networking, storage, machine learning (ML) and the internet of things (IoT). It also includes tools for cloud management, security, and development. The Google Cloud Storage is a highly dynamic storage solution that supports both SQL (Cloud SQL) and NoSQL (Cloud Datastore) database storage.\n\n\n* Similar to AWS, the popualrity of Azure also increases with experience. Azure is used to deploy code on Microsoft's servers. At its core, Azure replaces or supplements your on-premise infrastructure. However, it also delivers a vast range of other services such as Azure Analytics, AI services, IoT etc that improve the functioning of several departments in your organization and help you resolve critical business problems. It also supports data, development, compute and network services.\n\n\n> Cloud platforms are one of the most influential factors that has lead to the growth in demand for data science. These platforms has enabled users all over the world access to latest hardware, bigger data storage and ofcousrse massive compute power. Services like AWS, GCP and Azure requires that you pay only depending on your usage and as a result of that cloud services are a lot cheaper than setting up the required infrastructure on-site. As mentioned at the start of this section, there are also few cloud resources such as Google Colab, Kaggle notebook etc that provides access to decent hardware free of cost.
