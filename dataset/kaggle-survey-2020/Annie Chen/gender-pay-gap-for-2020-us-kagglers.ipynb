There is a lower percentage of women with higher-paying background and experience, such as years in programming or job level; \n\n2. Even when controlled for background and experience, women were still paid less than non-women. \n\nBefore proceeding, we make a couple of remarks on our methodology: \n\n- In this study, **background and experience** are broadly defined to include as many attributes as we could glean from survey data. \"Background\" includes job title, age, education, and attributes of their company; \"experience\" includes years in programming or in machine learning, as well as the number of technical tools used on a regular basis. \n\n- The **average annual salary** is an \"estimated average\" that is calculated as follows: Each salary range is represented by the midway point of the range (for example, `$0-999` is replaced with (0+999)/2=499.5, `1,000-1,999` is replaced with (1000+1999)/2 = 1499.5, and so on), and the highest range, `> $500,000`, is replaced with the lower bound of 500000. This differs from the conventional approach of using the median salary. The estimated average appears to be more informative because it provides more granularity, whereas the median salary is more coarse due the limited choices of salary range offered in the survey. That said, our code can easily be modified to use the median salary instead; see comments in the first code block of the notebook. \n\n- We compare women with **non-women**, which combines all other choices offered in the survey, including \"Man\" (75.10%), \"Prefer not to say\" (2.24%), \"Prefer to self-describe\" (0.27%), and \"Nonbinary\" (0.80%), for a total of 78.41% US survey respondents.

Specifically, the salary for non-women generally increases with greater programming experience, higher job levels, higher education levels, bigger companies, bigger data science teams, more years of machine learning experience, and greater incorporation of machine learning by the company. However, the same trend does not always hold for the salary of woman (brown bars). This indicates that **considerations affecting the salary of women may be different, and perhaps more complicated, than that of non-women**. \n\n- Looking at the the women-to-non-women salary ratios (i.e., the relative lengths of brown and blue bars), we see from the second row of figures that **gender disparity in salary is lowest in mid-sized companies** (those with 250-999 or 50-249 employees, and those with 5-9 or 3-4 data scientists). \n\n- The first figure, salary by age group, may be supporting evidence for what is known as the \"**motherhood penalty**\". Women in their thirties and forties are paid significantly less than their peers, compared with women aged 25-29.

However, the observations above offer some possible directions. We have shown that the gender pay gap for 2020 US Kagglers can be decomposed into two factors. Accordingly, there are two corresponding approaches for mitigating the gender pay gap:\n\n1. **Increase the percentage of women with higher-paying background and experience.** This could be achieved, for example, by offering more support to retain these women in the workforce, or by giving equal opportunities for their promotion to senior-level positions. \n\n2. **Decrease salary disparity between women and non-women with comparable background and experience.** For example, companies could establish a more objective metric for determining salary that is based on merit, so as to minimize gender bias. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<section id=\"future\">\n<h1>Recommendations for future Kaggle surveys</h1>\n</section>\n\nNote that we have purposedly steered away from using terms such as \"inequity\" when describing the factors contributing to the gender pay gap. Inequity or unfair treatment of women may be playing a role here, but such a claim cannot be supported or refuted by data available from the survey. \n\nThat said, it would be helpful if addition information could be collected in future Kaggle surveys. Below are some suggested survey questions that seem relatively easy to implement, and would provide further insights on factors contributing to the gender pay gap (as well as support other types of interesting analysis on the state of machine learning and data science): \n\n- **Greater accuracy in annual salary:** This would greatly improve any analysis related to pay. Some options include: offering more survey choices with greater granularity; separating $0 as its own option; allowing respondents to use their local currency (rather than converting to USD); asking respondents to round down their salary to the nearest thousand (say) and enter the actual number, rather than selecting from a list of given ranges. \n\n- **Hours of work per week:** This would help identify whether the respondent is in a full-time or part-time position. According to the [US Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/data/latest-annual-data/full-and-part-time-employment), the majority of part-time workers are women. Thus, a detailed study of the gender pay gap requires controlling for the number of work hours per week, rather than just looking at the annual salary. \n\n- **Hourly wage:** This, along with the hours of work per week, provide an alternative measure of pay that may be more informative than the annual salary. It can account for part-time positions, internships, or freelance consulting projects. \n\n- **Number of years employed in ML/DS positions:** This is a more concrete measure of actual work experience than the current Q6 (years in programming) or Q15 (years using ML methods). For example, a respondent might wonder: If I've been programming since college but took a couple years off to raise children or complete an MBA, do those years count towards my programming years? This ambiguity can be avoided by counting the actual number of work years.\n\n- **Academic discipline of, and years since, most recent degree earned:** Machine learning and data science are relatively new fields, and many people transition into such positions by either pursuing informal training on their own, or formally completing a degree or specialized program. Understanding the type of degree and the years since its completion would offer insights on whether women and non-women take different approaches in entering the field, and how that affects their pay.
