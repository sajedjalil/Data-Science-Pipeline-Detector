First, you can explore some general job titles along with the comparison of their roles (3.1. [Different job titles, different activities](#datajobs-roles)). Then, you will get a sense of the current trends in those positions with some statistics of the data professionals ( 3.2.

Different job titles, different roles\n\nPresumably, you may search only \"Data Scientist\" or \"Machine learning engineer\" in a job search engine, but you might be surprised that many DS&ML professionals in the Kaggle platform defines their professions with many different job titles. Here are short descriptions of some confusing job titles. \n\n\n- **Machine Learning Engineer**: A software engineer who leverages big data tools and programming frameworks to ensure that the raw data gathered from data pipelines are redefined as data science models that are ready to scale as needed. They’re also responsible for taking theoretical data science models and helping scale them out to production-level models that can handle terabytes of real-time data.[springboard.com](https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-vs-data-scientist/)\n\n- **Data Scientist**: A data profesesional who applies statistics, machine learning, and anlaytic approaches to solve critical business problems, and are also expected to have strong programming skills, an ability to design new algorithms, and some expertise in the domain knowledge to handle big data - [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer)\n\n- **Data Analyst**: A data professional in their organization who can query and process data, provide reports, summarize and visualize data, but in most of time, they are not expected to deal with anlyzing big data nor to develop new algorithms\" - [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer)\n\n- **Data Engineer**: A software engineer who prepares the “big data” infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists, more specifically, design, build, integrate data from various resources, and manage big data to optimize the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem. - [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer)\n\n- **Database Adminimstrator(DBA)/Database Engineer**: A software engineer who stores and organizes data, which includs some roles such as capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, as well as backup and data recovery - [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator)\n\n- **Business Analyst(BA)**: A data professional who analyzes an organization or business domain (real or hypothetical) and documents its business, processes, or systems, assessing the business model or its integration with technology - [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst)\n\n- Other Professions working with Data: **Research Scientist, Software Engineer,Statistician and Product/Project Manager**.\n\n\n\nTo have a better understading of each job title, let's look at the below figure which compares job roles across the different job titles. Here are some `findings` from the comparison\n\n1. Most common roles of all the data professionals are **Data Analysis(26.88%)**, **Prototyping(18.35%)** and **Data Infrastructure(15.64%)**\n2. **Data scientists do more data analysis tasks than ml engineers** while ml engineers are more focusing on prototyping and building machine learning service\n3. Data engineers and DBAs use a third of their working time in Building the data infrastructure\n4. Data analysts and Business analysts spend almost half of their activities in analyzing and understanding data to influence product business decisions   \n\n\n\n<!-- In the Kaggle DS&ML survey, there are seven types of typical data roles.\n\n|Roles | Description|\n|---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|**Analysis** | Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions|\n|**Data Infrastructure** | Build and/or run the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data|\n|**Prototyping** | Build prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas|\n|**Machine Learning** | Build and/or run a machine learning service that operationally improves my product or workflows|\n|**Experiments** | Experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models|\n|**Research** | Do research that advances the state of the art of machine learning|\n|**None** | None of these activities are an important part of my role at work|\n|**Other** | Other data related roles|\n -->\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Wrangling Data for Jobtitle-Activity relationship \"\"\"\n\nq23_map = {'Analysis':'Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions',\n            'Data Infrastructure':'Build and/or run the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data', \n            'Prototyping':'Build prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas', \n            'Machine Learning':'Build and/or run a machine learning service that operationally improves my product or workflows', \n            'Experiments':'Experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models', \n            'Research':'Do research that advances the state of the art of machine learning', \n            'None':'None of these activities are an important part of my role at work', \n            'Other':'Other'}\n\nq23_col_map = { 'Q23_Part_1':'Analysis', \n                'Q23_Part_2':'Data Infrastructure', \n                'Q23_Part_3':'Prototyping',\n                'Q23_Part_4':'Machine Learning', \n                'Q23_Part_5':'Experiments', \n                'Q23_Part_6':'Research', \n                'Q23_Part_7':'None', \n                'Q23_OTHER':'Other'}\n\n# change the value of columns related to Q23 to short name and numerical value to count\ndf_q23 = df.filter(regex=\"^(?=.*Q23)\").rename(columns=q23_col_map).copy()\ndf_q23.fillna(0, inplace=True)\ndf_q23.replace(to_replace=list(q23_map.values()), value=1, inplace=True)\n\n# combine Q5 with Q23 \ndf_q5q23 = pd.concat([df[['Q5']], df_q23], axis=1).groupby('Q5').sum().loc[q5_order].T\n# add a total \ndf_q5q23['All Professionals'] = df_q5q23.sum(axis=1)\ndf_q5q23 = df_q5q23[['All Professionals']+q5_order] # change the order \n# combine 'Other' and 'None'\ndf_q5q23.loc['Other'] += df_q5q23.loc['None'] \ndf_q5q23.drop('None', axis=0, inplace=True)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Figure1: Plotting Multiple Pie Graphs for Jobtitle-Activity \"\"\"\n\n# configure the grid size \nfig1 = plt.figure(figsize=(10,8)) \ngs_w, gs_h = 3, 4\ngs = fig1.add_gridspec(gs_w, gs_h)\ngs.update(wspace=0.1, hspace=0.3) \naxes1 = []\nfor i in range(gs_w):\n    for j in range(gs_h): \n        axes1.append(fig1.add_subplot(gs[i, j]))\n\n# draw a pie chart\ncolor_map = [\"#008294\", \"#d4ac0d\", \"#1f618d\", \"#c0392b\", \"#4b4b4c\", \"#A569BD\",\"#bdbdbd\"]\nfig1.patch.set_facecolor('#fbfbfb')\nfor i in range(gs_w * gs_h): \n    # wedges, texts =  axes1[i].pie(x=df_q5q23.iloc[:, i], colors=color_map, wedgeprops=dict(width=0.2)) # plain\n    wedges, texts, autotexts =  axes1[i].pie(x=df_q5q23.iloc[:, i], colors=color_map, wedgeprops=dict(width=0.2), \n                                            autopct=lambda pct: f\"{pct:5.2f}%\", textprops=dict(color=\"#4a4a4a\", fontsize=4))\n    axes1[i].text(0, 1.2, df_q5q23.columns[i], fontsize=8, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif', horizontalalignment='center')\n    axes1[i].set_facecolor('#fbfbfb')\n\n    \n# configure texts in graph \naxes1[0].text(-1., 2.5, 'Different Titles, Different Activities', fontsize=15, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif')\naxes1[0].text(-1., 2.1, 'from the Kaggle Survey 2020', fontsize=10, fontweight='light', fontfamily='serif')\naxes1[0].legend(wedges, df_q5q23.index,  bbox_to_anchor=(2.2, 0.05), loc=\"upper center\", ncol=7, fontsize=7)\naxes1[4].legend(wedges, df_q5q23.index,  bbox_to_anchor=(2.2, 0.05), loc=\"upper center\", ncol=7, fontsize=7)\naxes1[8].legend(wedges, df_q5q23.index,  bbox_to_anchor=(2.2, 0.05), loc=\"upper center\", ncol=7, fontsize=7)\n\nfig1.text(0.13, -0.02, \"\\n\".join([f\" -

What skills do you need to stand out your resume? Professionals vs. Students\n\nAs a programmer, skillsets have a great role in matching jobs. Skillsets might differ across various job fields, but I simplified the data to compare what data professionals use on regular basis and what students learn or practice to stand out their resumes. Here is the summary of the analysis from the graph below. \n\n- `Programming Languages`: Top language in DS & ML community is **Python** as expected. For other languages, students prefer to learn R over SQL, while many professionals work with SQL than R. \n- `Hosted Notebooks`: Around 30% of both professionals and students don't use hosted notebooks on regular basis, but the persons who use notebooks regularly favour working in **Colab, Kaggle, and Jupyter**. \n- `IDEs`: Most dominant IDEs used by both group is **Jupyter environment**\n- `Visualization Tools`: Top four tools preferred by both groups are **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Ggplot, and Plotly**.\n- `ML Frameworks`: Top three ML frameworks (**Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras**) are the same for both groups, but more students use Pytorch than Xgboost while professionals similarly use them both. \n- `ML Algorithms`: While both groups utilize **Linear/Logistic Regression and DecisionTrees/Random Forests** regularly, professionals use more Gradient Boosting Machines over Convolutional Neural Networks and Bayesian Approaches in their work.\n- `Learning Platform`: Kaggle Professionals thinks that the best learning platform is **Coursera(21%) followed by Kaggle Learn Courses(12%)** while Students prefers to study through **University Courses(21%) and Coursera(18%)**\n- `Media Sources`: Professionals usually share or report on data science topics via **Blogs(19%), Kaggle(16%) or YouTube(14%)** in order while Students would like to share in **Youtube(19%) the most, followed by Kaggle(17%) and Blogs(14%)** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\" Data Wrangling for skillset gap between professionals and students\"\"\"\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# define the dict of pd.Series \nskillset_map = OrderedDict({'Programming Launguages':'Q7',\n                            'IDEs':'Q9',   \n                            'ML Frameworks':'Q16',\n                            'Learning Platforms':'Q37',\n                            'Hosted Notebooks':'Q10', \n                            'Visualization Tools':'Q14',\n                            'ML Algorithms':'Q17',\n                            'Media Sources':'Q39'\n                           })\nskillset_dict = OrderedDict()\n        \ndef value_counts_multicolumns(mdf): \n    \"\"\"count each value in the multiple columns, which should have single value per single column\"\"\"\n    df_count = pd.Series(dtype='int')\n    for c in mdf.columns: \n        df_count[mdf[c].value_counts().index[0]] = mdf[c].count()\n    return df_count\n\n# cacluate each value_counts \nfor skill, quest in skillset_map.items(): \n    pro_count = value_counts_multicolumns(df.filter(regex=f\"^(?=.*{quest})\"))\n    pro_ratio = 100. * (pro_count / pro_count.sum())\n    \n    std_count = value_counts_multicolumns(df_std.filter(regex=f\"^(?=.*{quest})\"))\n    std_ratio = 100. * (std_count / std_count.sum())        \n    \n    skillset_dict[skill] = pd.concat([pro_ratio, std_ratio], axis=1).sort_values(0)\n    skillset_dict[skill].rename(columns={0:'Professionals',1:'Students'}, inplace=True)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\" Figure6: multiple plots for skillset gap between professionals and students\"\"\"\n\n# plot a horizontal barchart \nr, c = 4, 2\nfig6, axs6 = plt.subplots(r,c,figsize=(8,16), sharex=True)\n\nfor idx, (skill, df_skill) in enumerate(skillset_dict.items()):\n    y_range = np.arange(len(df_skill.index))\n    bar_width = 0.4\n                               \n    barh_pro = axs6[idx%r][idx//r].barh(y_range + bar_width/2, df_skill['Professionals'], bar_width, color='#ec7063', label=\"Professionals\") \n    barh_std = axs6[idx%r][idx//r].barh(y_range -
