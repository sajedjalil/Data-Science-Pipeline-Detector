Here, I explore the [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020) to examine the 'Educational Platforms' Kagglers have used to learn and augment their skills. In the survey, Kagglers were asked: <b>On which platforms have you begun or completed data science courses? (Select all that apply)</b>, and given the following platforms: [Cloud-cert](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10748-top-5-cloud-certifications.html), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), and finally University courses for credit. \n\nThis notebook will examine both how individuals take these educational platforms, and educational platforms are taken together. \n\n### By the end of the notebook, we'll be able to see that University Courses (in red) are less related to all other types of educational platforms.

This is typically represented as the probability of P(B|A), or the probability of B given A. In this data, it is the probability of taking one course, given that you've taken another. The formula is P(B|A) = probability of A and B / probability of A. \n\nOne thing that pops out to me in this is how these results are still somewhat dependent on the overall popularity of the educational platform. For example, the probability that someone took Fast.ai given they took Coursera is 0.8 (bottom left), but the probability that you took Coursera given you took Fast.ai is 0.12 (upper right). This is influenced by overall popularity, as the probability of Coursera is aout 60%, while the probability of fast.ai is about 10%. \n\nInstead, a more informative measure is to divide the conditional probability by probability of A and the probability of B. This quantity tells us the probability that A and B co-occurr, divided by the probability that they occurr independtly of one another. The log of the quantity is taken so that both an increase, and a decrease in probability are on the same scale. (As a side note, feel free to share if this quantity has a specific name. It is almost the mutual information, but not quite.) Using this quantity, we see that on average, taking university courses for credit is less associated with the education platforms, with the exception of linkedin and cloud certifications. In contrast, we see that fast.ai and Udacity, and Linkedin and Coud Certification are more likely to be taken together. \n\n<i>Take home: by just looking at the conditional probability, all of the courses are popular given that you have taken Coursera.
