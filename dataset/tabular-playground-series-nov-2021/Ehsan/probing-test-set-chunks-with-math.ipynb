He uses a good performing submission and replaces the output for diffirent chunks with pre-defined values, then by submitting the new outputs we can get some information about the actual ratio of positive samples in the public part of the test set.\n\nIn this notebook I'm going to show a mathematical way to estimate the ratio. I will be using a different approach when submitting probing submissions and then use the AUC score to approximate positive ratios given some assumptions.\n\nlong story short, here are the ratios (probabilities) for the 9 chunks in the test set:\n\n**(0.51242,\n 0.59540,\n 0.42619,\n 0.45032,\n 0.54770,\n 0.54590,\n 0.40770,\n 0.45896,\n 0.55530)**\n\nI also don't think these can help so much for making a better prediction, given the fact that 25% of targets are flipped and we have already reached 0.75 AUC, but let's have some fun with the mathematics of AUC.\n\nRefer to these notebook and discussions for more info regarding the chunks:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ambrosm/tpsnov21-012-leaderboard-probing/notebook\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/discussion/286731","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-26T23:20:04.614716Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-26T23:20:04.614934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-26T23:20:04.624529Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-26T23:20:04.614912Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-26T23:20:04.623334Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Probing\n\nfor the leaderboard probing part I'm using submissions with 0s,1s.

For the given input vecotrs (y_true, y_pred), we know y_true is binary, and without losing generality we can assume y_pred values are in the [0,1] range. Now we would pick different threshoulds as decision threshoulds and assign 0,1 labels to the y_pred. So if we have 100 prediction values in range [0,1] when we chose the threshould as 0.2 we will end up in a vetor like [0,0,0, ..., 1,1,1] and using this new vector we can calculate True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate compared to original target (y_true).\n\nFalse Posiive Rate is the number of false positives devided by total number of actual negative samples, and True Positive Rate is the number of true postives devided by the number of actual positives.\n\n$FPR = \\frac{FP}{N} = \\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$\n\n$TPR = \\frac{TP}{P} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$\n\nBy changing the threshould we would get different values for FPR, TPR and ploting them would give us the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The area under this curve is typically called AUC (area under curve).
