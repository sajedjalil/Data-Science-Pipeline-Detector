The structure of this analysis is as follows:\n\n**1. Data loading and inspection** - Loading the data as Python dataframes and conducting data quality checks\n\n**2.

The bigger yearly periodic spike in transactions seem to occur at the end of the year in December, specifically on the 23 December every year-end. Perhaps this is due to some sort of Christmas sale/discount that Corporacion Favorita holds every December thereby explaining the bump in transactions on this date. The weaker periodic spike given by the green dotted lines seems to occur around the middle of the months of May , specifically on the sunday in the second week of May. Perhaps another similar scheme is being implemented by Corporacion Favorita on those sundays."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"228d48b321425cde9803c66f28016bc9a895b928","_cell_guid":"9bdb1afd-c4b8-4aa9-bd38-72f3c2371ca2"},"source":"## 2e.
