I started with the training and test sets, sample submission, and store, item, and transaction metadata but plan on including the other data sets as well at a later point. Below, I will investigate the distribution of observations with respect to different features. I also inspected the distribution of the target variable, which is unit sales, for outliers. I found some interesting differences between the distribution of observations in the training and tests sets that are worth considering before training models. I also found that, within the store metadata, that store cluster is a subdivision of store type and that one state can have many different store types. Please upvote if you find this useful!

We noticed that there are some differences between the training and test sets with regards to the time period sampled, the number of unique items, each stores' variety, and percentage of sale items.
