Via some quick open-source research (i.e Googling), this trend checks out as it seems oil prices were kept fairly stable from 2010 till mid-2014 after which it drastically fell ( due to a confluence of reasons such as weak demand due to poor economic growth and surging alternative sources of crude oil from shale/tar sands).\n","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4089fa8e74806befd03ee90257c9a76e32d23c7f","_cell_guid":"d32bc964-fd62-4a4e-b78c-cc977b696c49"},"source":"## 2b. Stores data\n\nWith regards to the \"stores.csv\" file, the data dictionary on the Kaggle competition simply states that it contains metadata on the city, state, the store type and a column termed \"cluster\". Now this cluster column is a grouping to stores that are similar to each other and as we can see from the latter analysis, there are a total of 17 distinct clusters.

To do so, I will take our stores Python dataframe and group it based on the columns \"store_nbr\" and \"cluster\" via the **groupby** statement. After which, I will unstack the grouping which means that I will pivot on the level of store_nbr index labels, returning a DataFrame having a new level of columns which are the store clusters whose inner-most level relate to the pivoted store_nbr index labels.
