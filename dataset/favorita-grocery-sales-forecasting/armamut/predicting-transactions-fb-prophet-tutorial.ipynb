It is based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality, plus holidays. It works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers.

But the model predicts the sales on the 24th Decembers nicely. And also forecasted period after Aug 15th 2017 looks good.\n\nAnd, as a non-ecuadorian person, I can say from the graph that \"Dia de la Madre\" is an important event, and it boosts sales previous day.\n\nAnd, that's it. Prophet is a fairly easy to use library to forecast time-series data, which only uses previous data and holidays for that. There are more features and parameters like saturating forecasts, uncertanity intervals etc. which we didn't cover here. You can read more from their paper https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf.\n\nI think it's not a full-featured regression or forecasting tool, as we cannot use other data to use correlations or effects of another variable etc. But, It could be a replacement for time-series models like ARMA, ARIMA etc. Please comment below if you think you know more ways to improve this model.
