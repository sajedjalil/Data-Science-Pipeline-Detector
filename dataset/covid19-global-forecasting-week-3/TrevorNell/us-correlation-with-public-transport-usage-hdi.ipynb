The Spearman correlation coefficient is calculated at 0.55 and p-value highly significant. \n\nIn the **first part** of this notebook we explore the possible correlation between public transport usage in the US and the number of confirmed corona virus cases, by State.\n\nThe tranportation research I am referencing can be found here: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/infrastructure/transportation\nIt is, in part, based on research conducted by the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.\n\nTransportation is further broken down into four metrics: commute time, road quality, bridge quality and public transit usage.\n\nEach metric is represented by a ranking for the state. The main metric for this study is the public transit usage metric and is defined as:\n\n**Public Transit Usage**\n\nThis metric measures the average miles traveled on public transportation by one state resident in 2016. With an average of about 1 mile traveled per person, Mississippi’s public transit system earned the state the bottom slot, and with about 42 miles per person, New York was No. 1.\n\nThe **null hypothesis** for this study is that there is no correlation between Public Transit Usage and the number of confirmed cases of corona virus currently. My alpha is at the 5% level.\n\nObviously I am thinking that before lockdown the virus had chance to spread via public transport infrastructure.\n\nIn the **second part** of this notebook we explore the possible correlation between the American Human Development Index and the number of confirmed corona virus cases, by State.\n\nThe data were taken from the [American Human Development Report](http://http://measureofamerica.org/human-development/#american%20human%20development%20index).\nHuman development according to them is defined as:\n\n**Human development**\n\nHuman development is defined as the process of enlarging people’s freedoms and opportunities and improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to live.\n\nFollow the link to read more about it, its quite interesting.\nThe **null hypothesis** for this study is that there is no correlation between American Human Develpment Index and the number of confirmed cases of corona virus currently. My alpha is at the 5% level."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 1: Public Transport Usage"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np\nimport pylab as pl\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import spearmanr\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"import the data:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3/train.csv\")\ntransport_rankings = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/transport-rankings-by-state/US_Transport_Rankings.csv\")\ntrain.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"transport_rankings.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Rename external cols and filter on US data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"transport_rankings.columns=('OverallTransportRank','Province_State','CommuteTime','PublicTransitUsage','RoadQuality','BridgeQuality')\ntrain = train[train['Country_Region'] == 'US']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Group by State and sum the confirmed cases (yes its cumulative, this is a measure of magnitude, so all good), then rank the states by confirmed cases:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"unique = pd.DataFrame(train.groupby(['Country_Region', 'Province_State'],as_index=False)['ConfirmedCases'].sum())\nunique['ConfirmedCases_rank'] = unique['ConfirmedCases'].rank(ascending=False)\nunique.sort_values(by=['ConfirmedCases_rank'], inplace=True)\nunique.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Merge the data on the state column:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"combined = pd.DataFrame(unique.merge(transport_rankings, on='Province_State'))\ncombined.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So now we are ready to run some rank correlation tests.
