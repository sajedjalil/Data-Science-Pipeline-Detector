V1 Assumes all the rows have the same probability to be wrong, however the naive baseline is 0.926. \nI'll assume that there is no chance to be mistaken for the naive prediction, and there is an equal probability to be mistaken in the rest. It is a rough estimation because there are places more prones to errors than others.\nIt means the correlation is high between the teams and therefore, the speard would be tighter.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4dafb6c6-b196-4af2-8e9a-0229c7f72536","_uuid":"39ba04a4d169ca116f997c88d6f7717a09ae046f"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"434af7e7-9bdf-407b-b5ee-95083f134b18","_uuid":"feee9d8990963f84499823ec4b859c427f82de1d","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"source":"accuracy = 0.997\nnaive_accuracy = 0.926\nn_samples = 1000000\nn_not_naive = int(1000000 * (1-naive_accuracy))\n\n# Writing the total numbers correct answers\nanswers = np.zeros((n_samples))\nanswers[:int(n_samples * accuracy)] = 1\n\nprint(np.mean(answers))","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0975881e-a9ca-4113-a1b7-70354590259c","_uuid":"03aa31fafad7f491ddcf8598e96f4c75d8fa508c"},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"source":"n_monte_carlo = 50  # 50 for good normal behaiviour\npublic_percent = 0.01\nn_public_samples = int(n_samples * public_percent)\nn_team_montecarlo = 50\n\n# conducting a monte carlo experiment\nteam_std = []\nfor i in range(n_monte_carlo):\n    team_scores = []\n    for j in range(n_team_montecarlo):\n        # team answers with random errors in the non naive part\n        team_answers = answers.copy()\n        team_answers[-(n_not_naive):] = np.random.choice(team_answers[-(n_not_naive):], n_not_naive)\n        # random seed is the same for all the teams\n        np.random.seed(10*i)\n        public_samples = np.random.choice(team_answers, n_public_samples)  # choosing public_percent of samples\n        team_scores.append(np.mean(public_samples))\n    team_std.append(np.std(team_scores))  # calculating standard deviation of the experiment\nteam_mean_std = np.mean(team_std)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"44875d00-f6f8-4874-a829-9976c55f6128","_uuid":"f389bef2a7919698b7cc3d560574f8547f503b5f","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"source":"# Using normal distribution property\nprint(\"The standard deviation of the score is {0:.5f} \".format(team_mean_std))\nprint(\"Total score has ~68% of being inside the {0:.5f} to {1:.5f} interval\".format(\n    (accuracy - team_mean_std), \n    (accuracy + team_mean_std)))\nprint(\"Total score has ~95% of being inside the {0:.5f} to {1:.5f} interval\".format(\n    (accuracy - 2*team_mean_std), \n    (accuracy + 2*team_mean_std)))","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"36ca35b8-0540-4433-9908-68c56eacc490","_uuid":"5140708f177b480a011265f0d0a8d0dde4532d56"},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"source":"Conclusion:\nUsing correlation, the standrad deviation became smaller. a difference of 0.0001 on the leaderboard is not important, however there is a significant speard between the top 10.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79e7e9cd-42e6-4160-9877-2bb8c734c9ed","_uuid":"5e7eb33058c59881037783c4efa122083c3c29e4"},"cell_type":"markdown"}],"nbformat_minor":1,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.3","name":"python","file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"}}}}
