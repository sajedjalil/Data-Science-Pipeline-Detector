Players can be on teams (groupId) that get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In-game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.
