Do you always need to wait for 1 hour to see the impact of a newly added feature?\n\nI talked with experienced Kaggers about feature engineering.\nThey said that you get more accurate result when you check on the actual complex model you carefully built. But, it can be another risk if longer training time reduces the number of your trials.\n\n**Traid-off: Accurate result <=> The number of trials**\n\nHow they work on a competition is like below.\n\n1. EDA\n2. Build a simple model\n3. Try various features on a simple model\n4. Build a complex model\n5. Train with promising features\n\nThey go back and forth between steps during a competition.

SHAP values\n\nSHAP proposed a new fair way to measure contribution which is justified in game theory.\n\n[A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model\nPredictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07874.pdf) (2017)\n\n> Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability.\n\nSimple models are easy to interpret. They built a simple model which works well only on a local point (We don't need to predict on the all points). Then, use the simple model to interpret how it's trained.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcotcr/lime/master/doc/images/lime.png\" width=\"420\">\n\nThis method was proposed in this paper: [“Why Should I Trust You?”\nExplaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf) (2016, known as LIME)\n\nThe main contribution of SHAP is that they introduced the concept of Shapley Value to measure the contribution.\n\nShapley Value is a solution concept in cooperative game theory, proposed in 1953 by [Lloyd Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Shapley).\n\n- Question: What is a \"fair\" way for a colition to divide its payoff?\n  - Depends on the definition of \"fairness\"\n- Approach: Identify axioms that express properties of a fair payoff division\n  - Symmetry: Interchangeable agents should receive the same payments\n  - Dummy Players: Dummy players should receive nothing\n  - Additivity: $$(v_1 + v_2)(S) = v_1(S) + v_2(S)$$\n\nThe author of SHAP found that we can apply this concept to machine learning. In machine learning, *player* is *feature*, and *contribution* is *score*.\n\nFor example, we have 3 features L, M, and N. The shapley values are calculated like below.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DLL5sCQKeVXboAYIvdgwUw.png\" width=\"640\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uGjQRe9U0ebC5HxYXAzg3A.png\" width=\"420\">\n\nIt's the average of combinations of features.
