Once you are on the ground, you have to find weapons, ammo, and various other healing/booster items to stay alive. The main goal of this game is to be the last man standing.\nEach PUBG match can be a solo, duo, or squads match. In a solo match, there can be maximum of 100 people on the map and the last man standing wins the game. In duos, there can be 50 groups max where each group can have a maximum of 2 members. In squads, every group can have maximum of 4 members so a total of 25 groups can be a part of a single match. All these numbers are the maximum numbers so there can be less than 25 groups in squads or less than 50 groups in duos. The rules are the same for every format; the last man standing (or the last group in case of squads/duos) wins the game.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nSince this is my first kernel and I am new to datascience, I will only perform the analysis of the training dataset. My analysis will only be for the solo games and my main goal will be to figure out the common traits among winners and losers. My focus will be on the trends of the top 10% players in every match and the last 25% in every game.\n\n**Data**\n\nHere is a list of every column of the data provided on kaggle and the description of every column.\n•\tDBNOs: Number of enemy players knocked.\n•\tAssists: Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n•\tBoosts: Number of boost items used.\n•\tdamageDealt: Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n•\theadshotKills: Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n•\tHeals: Number of healing items used.\n•\tkillPlace: Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n•\tkillPoints: Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)\n•\tkillStreaks: Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n•\tKills: Number of enemy players killed.\n•\tlongestKill: Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n•\tmatchId: Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n•\tRevives: Number of times this player revived teammates.\n•\trideDistance: Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n•\troadKills: Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n•\tswimDistance: Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n•\tteamKills: Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n•\tvehicleDestroys: Number of vehicles destroyed.\n•\twalkDistance: Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n•\tweaponsAcquired: Number of weapons picked up.\n•\twinPoints: Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.)\n•\tgroupId: Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n•\tnumGroups: Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n•\tmaxPlace: Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n•\twinPlacePerc: The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f17caccba882eb28509356270a03f4dd11965288"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ndf.info()\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c7fb320dbd0fe87f161df5ed3f7e37ac4f117dd1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Isolate the solo games\nsolo_df = pd.DataFrame()\nsolo_df = df[df[\"numGroups\"]>50].copy()\nsolo_df.info()\n# Checking if there aren't any duplicates or na's\nsolo_df.duplicated().value_counts()\nsolo_df.isna().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9fc27a3760143571921be5753f876f75100eac97"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Double checking solo games.
