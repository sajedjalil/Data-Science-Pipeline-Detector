There are two types of multicollinearity:\n1. **Structural multicollinearity** is a mathematical artifact caused by creating new predictors from other predictors — such as, creating the predictor *x*<sup>2</sup> from the predictor *x*.\n2. **Data-based multicollinearity** is a result of a poorly designed experiment, reliance on purely observational data, or the inability to manipulate the system on which the data are collected.\n\nWhat this really means is that when predictor variables are correlated, the estimated regression coefficient of any one variable will depend on which predictor variables, and in which order, are included in the model.\n\n## Variance Inflation Factor\nAs the name suggests, the [variance inflation factor] is a measure of how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated by when multicollinearity exists.
