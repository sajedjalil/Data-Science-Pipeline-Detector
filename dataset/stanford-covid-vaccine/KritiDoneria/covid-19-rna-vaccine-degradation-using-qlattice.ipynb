We perform an analysis on the [OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine) dataset.\n\nThe raw dataset consists of 2400 mRNA samples. Each mRNA consists of 107 nucleotides and various measurments were performed on the first 68 nucleotides. These measurements consisted of reactivity, degradation at pH10 with and without magnesium, and degradation at $50^o C$ with and without magnesium.\n\nSome of the Covid-19 vaccines are mRNA based. However due to the unstable nature of mRNA they must be refrigerated in extreme conditions. What this means is that distribution of the vaccine can be problematic. \n\nThe aim of this tutorial is to gain insights into the stability of general mRNA samples with the potential to apply it to Covid-19 vaccine candidates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> Installation </h1>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install feyn","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-19T12:16:12.695027Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-19T12:16:12.695456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-19T12:16:23.151907Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-19T12:16:12.695415Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-19T12:16:23.150883Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport feyn\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfrom IPython.display import display","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-19T12:16:23.153485Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-19T12:16:23.153809Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-19T12:16:24.441879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-19T12:16:23.153776Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-19T12:16:24.440587Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Inspecting the raw data\n\nHere we can see that the data we have is the sequence and the predicted structure and loop type of each base in the RNA.
