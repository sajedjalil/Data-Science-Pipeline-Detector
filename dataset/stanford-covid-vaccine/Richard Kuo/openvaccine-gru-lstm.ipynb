In particular, it is a challenge to design stable messenger RNA molecules. Typical vaccines are packaged in syringes and shipped under refrigeration around the world, but that is not possible for mRNA vaccines (currently).**\n\n**Researches have noticed that RNA molecules tend to spontaneously degrade, which is highly problematic because a single cut can render mRNA vaccines useless. Not much is known about which part of the backbone of a particular RNA is most susceptible to being damaged.**\n\n**Without this knowledge, the current mRNA vaccines are shopped under intense refrigeration and are unlikely to reach enough humans unless they can be stabilized. This is our task as Kagglers: we must create a model to predict the most likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule.**\n\n**We are given a subset of an Eterna dataset comprised of over 3000 RNA molecules and their degradation rates at each position. Our models are then tested on the new generation of RNA sequences that were just created by Eterna players for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines**\n\n**Before we get started, please check out [Xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu)'s notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/openvaccine-simple-gru-model) as this one is based on it: I just added comments, made minor code changes, an LSTM, and fold training:**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#get comp data\ntrain = pd.read_json('/kaggle/input/stanford-covid-vaccine/train.json', lines=True)\ntest = pd.read_json('/kaggle/input/stanford-covid-vaccine/test.json', lines=True)\nsample_sub = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/stanford-covid-vaccine/sample_submission.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# I. Brief EDA\n\n**From the data [description tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/data), we must predict multiple ground truths in this competition, 5 to be exact. While the submission requires all 5, only 3 are scored: `reactivity`, `deg_Mg_pH10` and `deg_Mg_50C`. It might be interesting to see how performance differs when training for all 5 predictors vs. just the 3 that are scored.**\n\n**The training features we are given are as follows:**\n\n* **id** - An arbitrary identifier for each sample.\n* **seq_scored** - (68 in Train and Public Test, 91 in Private Test) Integer value denoting the number of positions used in scoring with predicted values. This should match the length of `reactivity`, `deg_*` and `*_error_*` columns. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n* **seq_length** - (107 in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Integer values, denotes the length of `sequence`. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n* **sequence** - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Describes the RNA sequence, a combination of `A`, `G`, `U`, and `C` for each sample. Should be 107 characters long, and the first 68 bases should correspond to the 68 positions specified in `seq_scored` (note: indexed starting at 0).\n* **structure** - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) An array of `(`, `)`, and `.` characters that describe whether a base is estimated to be paired or unpaired. Paired bases are denoted by opening and closing parentheses e.g. (....) means that base 0 is paired to base 5, and bases 1-4 are unpaired.\n* **reactivity** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample.\n* **deg_pH10** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high pH (pH 10).\n* **deg_Mg_pH10** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating with magnesium in high pH (pH 10).\n* **deg_50C** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n* **deg_Mg_50C** - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as `seq_scored`. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in `sequence`, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating with magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n* **`*_error_*`** - An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as the corresponding `reactivity` or `deg_*` columns, calculated errors in experimental values obtained in `reactivity` and `deg_*` columns.\n* **predicted_loop_type** - (1x107 string) Describes the structural context (also referred to as 'loop type')of each character in `sequence`. Loop types assigned by bpRNA from Vienna RNAfold 2 structure.
