However, their application has until recently been restricted by the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA. Recent technological advances have now largely overcome these issues, and multiple mRNA vaccine platforms against infectious diseases and several types of cancer have demonstrated encouraging results in both animal models and humans. This Review provides a detailed overview of mRNA vaccines and considers future directions and challenges in advancing this promising vaccine platform to widespread therapeutic use.\n\n<h3> mRNA Vaccine - The considerable points </h3>\n\n\n* Recent improvements in mRNA vaccines act to increase protein translation, modulate innate and adaptive immunogenicity and improve delivery.\n\n* mRNA vaccines have elicited potent immunity against infectious disease targets in animal models of influenza virus, Zika virus, rabies virus and others, especially in recent years, using lipid-encapsulated or naked forms of sequence-optimized mRNA.\n\n* Diverse approaches to mRNA cancer vaccines, including dendritic cell vaccines and various types of directly injectable mRNA, have been employed in numerous cancer clinical trials, with some promising results showing antigen-specific T cell responses and prolonged disease-free survival in some cases.\n\n* Therapeutic considerations and challenges include scaling up good manufacturing practice (GMP) production, establishing regulations, further documenting safety and increasing efficacy.\n\n<h3> The issues with mRNA Vaccine </h3>\n\n* Designing super stable messenger RNA molecules (mRNA).\n* RNA molecules have the tendency to spontaneously degrade. This is a serious limitation--a single cut can render the mRNA vaccine useless. \n\nCurrently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to being affected. Without this knowledge, current mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 must be prepared and shipped under intense refrigeration, and are unlikely to reach more than a tiny fraction of human beings on the planet unless they can be stabilized."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Had there been any mRNA Vaccine research for diseases?\n\n\n<h3> mRNA-based active cancer immunotherapy, combined with local radiation treatment in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer</h3>  \n\nSources : https://jitc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40425-019-0520-5  \n\n\n\n<h3> About mRNA Association with Small Cell Lung Cancer </h3>\n\nPreviously research has been carried out regarding the usasge of mRNA based immunotherapy for treatment of small cell Lung Cancer.\nPreclinical studies demonstrate synergism between cancer immunotherapy and local radiation, enhancing anti-tumor effects and promoting immune responses.

The count of blood components </H3>\n\nPatients tested positive for COVID-19 show significantly lower levels of platelets, leukocytes and eosinophils. We can also observe lower levels of calcium and magnesium, but significantly higher concentrations of ferritin, in comparison to patients tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe decrease in white blood cells (leukocytes) can either be a direct result of the COVID-19 infection or other pre-existing conditions. This decrease lowers patient immunity against COVID-19 and other infections in general. Additionally, electrolytes and minerals such as potassium, magnesium and zinc play a critical role in maintaining vitality, repairing cell damage, as well as immunity.\n\n<H3> 2. The Associations </H3>\n\nBy extracting clinical data from the literature, we can examine the abnormalities in blood tests in patients diagnosed with cancer and patients testing positive for COVID-19. Blood test results for multiple minerals were extracted for patients with lung cancer and compared with levels seen in COVID-19 patients. [1,2]\n\nBecause the clinical data available for patients tested for COVID-19 is normalised, measurements retrieved for cancer patients were also normalised using blood concentration in control groups as the mean. The published data has reported the mean and standard deviation of the measurements instead of individual readings, we use these metrics to simulate mineral concentrations in cancer patients assuming a normal distribution. The measurements retrieved from studies were for Magnesium, Ferritin and Zinc in both cancer patients as well as control groups.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3WgqNGV/2.png\" alt=\"2\" border=\"0\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<H3> Analysis of Electrolyte Abnormalities </h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gTjCb0X/4.png\" alt=\"4\" border=\"0\">\n\nPatients diagnosed with lung cancer show a wide distribution of ferritin levels, however, it peaks around +0.5 standard deviation unites which is similar to the peak of ferritin levels of patients tested positive for COVID-19. These levels are higher than what is observed for patients tested negative in the COVID-19 test (mean equivalent to -0.5 standard deviation units).\n\nWe can conclude from these observations that patients who retracted COVID-19 have similar electrolyte abnormalities as patients with lung cancer. **Hence a positive research on the mRNA Vaccine can be the game changing move to develop a successful vaccine for COVID-19.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stanford mRNA Degradation Predictor\n\n\n<H3> Solving the task challenge of mRNA Vaccine Degradation Predictor the RNA Base Pairs </H3>  \n\nSpecial thanks to Tucker Arrants.

both the current condition of the situation and the importance of the mRNA Vaccine and the associated research with the same. This notebook would be updated by me to check for much newer and diverse data to analyze more trends. I'll try to see around Kaggle contributions and try to modify the codes accordingly and publish them.\n\nContact LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/amankumar01/\n\nFeel free to edit this notebook as per your will.
