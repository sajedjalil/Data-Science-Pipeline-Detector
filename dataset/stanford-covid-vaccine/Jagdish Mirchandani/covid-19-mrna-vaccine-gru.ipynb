One of the biggest challenges right now is how to design super stable messenger RNA molecules (mRNA). \n\nResearchers have observed that RNA molecules have the tendency to spontaneously degrade. \n\nThis is a serious limitation--a single cut can render the mRNA vaccine useless. \n\nCurrently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to being affected. \n\nImproving the stability of mRNA vaccines was a problem that was being explored before the pandemic but was expected to take many years to solve. Now, we must solve this deep scientific challenge in months, if not weeks, to accelerate mRNA vaccine research and deliver a refrigerator-stable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. \n\nThe problem we are trying to solve has eluded academic labs, industry R&D groups, and supercomputers, and now its our turn. \n\nIn this competition, we are looking to leverage the data science expertise of the Kaggle community to develop models and design rules for RNA degradation. \n\nWe need to build a model which will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule, trained on a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position.
