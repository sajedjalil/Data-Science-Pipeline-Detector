I like to take this sort of micro-level look to learn about the data and get ideas for feature engineering. The potential features might be derived from the given data or they might require data from other sources. Using such features and/or ones like them will help improve model performance.\n\nHere's a quick look at the data with the target-like columns separated."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport hvplot.pandas\nimport geoviews as gv\nimport holoviews as hv\nhv.extension('bokeh')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/bigquery-geotab-intersection-congestion/train.csv', \n                    index_col='RowId')\ntest = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/bigquery-geotab-intersection-congestion/test.csv', \n                    index_col='RowId')\ntarget_cols = [col for col in train.columns.tolist() if\n                    col not in test.columns.tolist()]\ntarget_df = train[(target_cols)]\ntrain = train.drop(target_cols, axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tt = pd.concat([train,test], keys=['train', 'test'], sort=False)\n\nif tt.columns[-1:][0] == 'City': #Move city column to where it belongs\n    ttcols = tt.columns.tolist() \n    ttcols_moved = ttcols[-1:] + ttcols[:-1] \n    tt = tt[ttcols_moved].reset_index(level=0)\ndisplay(tt.head(), target_df.head())\n#del train, test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Optional function to change column name format from CamelCase to snake_case\ndef snakify(camel_list):\n    snake_list = []\n    for c in camel_list:\n        underscored = re.sub('(.)([A-Z][a-z]+)', r'\\1_\\2', c)\n        refined = re.sub('([a-z0-9])([A-Z])', r'\\1_\\2', underscored).lower()\n        snake_list.append(refined)\n    return snake_list\n\n# tt.columns = snakify(tt.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Area Recon\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Example 1- Boston\nLet's first look at Boston from a high-flying drone.

I think of intersections as a collection of related traffic paths passing through a common point. In this dataset, the 'Paths' feature lists the unique paths at each intersection. Each traffic path has it's own dynamics and can affect other paths. There may be an advantage to stacking and/or using the target variables that aren't part of the LB score.\n\nWe'll first look at the intersection of Land Blvd and Cambridgeside Place, not far from where I lived several years ago. This area has intersections from both train and test. I pulled the street view image manually from Google Maps vs. using their wonderful APIs.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/buKIbkr.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PIbDbtJ.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\"/>\n\nHere are some things to notice and potential features that might help:\n  - It's a T-intersection: it can have up to 6 paths plus any u-turns.\n  - One street is a major artery connecting two bridges: the road name ends in Boulevard\n  - The other street is a small side street: the road name ends in Place\n  - The intersection is surrounded by businesses that drive evening and weekend traffic: area zoning might be useful (industrial, commercial, retail, residential). \n  - It's in the city of Cambridge, not Boston proper: try density or distance from a common point\n  - There's a stoplight with protected left turns: control mechanism (and rare for Boston - hence the [Boston Left](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Boston%20Left)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Example 2 - Philadelphia\nLet's now look at Philadelphia the same way.

We have the direction of turn data which should help a model. Going straight through on Land or u-turning has the highest variation.
