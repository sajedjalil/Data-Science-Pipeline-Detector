Therefore the kernel relies as much as possible on BQ. All features are generated in BQ with varying SQL-techniques. The prediction model is also build in BQ. \n\nSince the ML features in BQ are currently limited to Lineare Regression, KMeans and Logistic Regression there is a subcompetition within the competition, that ranks top BQML submissions separatly. (There is also a second subcompetition for using TensorFlow with BigQuery.) This kernel aims towards the BQML subcompetition. \n\nThe kernel uses all the provided ML algorithms:\n- KMeans for Geo-Spatial Clustering\n- Logistic Regression for Adversarial Validation\n- Linear Regression for Prediction Model\n\n\n## Summary\nFeatures:\n- intersectionid + city (*i_id*)\n- city, hour, weekend, month\n- path, entry_street_name, exit_street_name\n- 20 clusters of intersections per city\n- Distance to the 5 nearest cluster center\n- 8 directions of turn (left, right, centered, uturn, centered-left, ...)\n    - Directions, entry- and exit-heading are not embedded directly. Instead they are translated into degrees (e.g. centered = 90deg). \n    - Afterwards the degree features are split additionaly into two features sin(feature_x_deg) and cos(feature_x_deg).\n    - Besides the direction of the turn, sin and cos feature are added for entry heading and exit heading \n- number of intersections per cluster\n- number of observations per city and hour\n- zipcode\n- population of zipcode\n- population of zipcode per intersection\n- intersections per zipcode\n- flag, if entry and exit are the same_street\n- intersection observation frequency\n- approching street length\n- approching street length fallback flag, if approching street length was derived from a more general approach due of missing data\n\nFeatures that didn't improve the model:\n- daytime, season (removed from model, since not improving)\n- road_type_entry, road_type_exit (removed from model, since not improving)\n\nTrain-Valid-Split:\n- out of adversarial validation (drop 25 % of not test like data from train) (used by detailed model)\n- split by id range (used by general model)\n\nTrain-Valid-Split that didn't improved the model:\n- remove outliers (target > Q99) from train (removed from model, since not improving)\n\nModel:\n- Linear Regression\n    - Detailed Model for known path and intersections in train and test\n    - General Model for unknown path and intersections\n\n## External data\nThe kernel uses zipcodes and population data from the public *bigquery-public-data*-set:\n- bigquery-public-data.utility_us.zipcode_area\n- bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010\n\nThe dataset can be included in the bigquery console (*add ressources*). I shared a preparation of the data (including references to intersections and a csv file for python users) [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joatom/bqml-population-of-zip-code-per-intersection).\n\n## Credits\nSome of the ideas are inspired by the following kernels.
