This competition asks us to predict the action of drug sample based on gene expression & cell viability data. This competition is interesting because it provided me an opportunity to work on multilabel classification & Principal Component Analysis for the first time. This notebook is my attempt to make sense of the data through exploratory analysis & visualizations and establish a prediction benchmark using Random Forests. Please provide your feedback in the comments.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Making sense of Domain Specific Terminologies](#terminology)\n* [Importing the raw datasets & basic overview of datasets](#introduction)\n* [Distribution of Gene Expression & Cell Viability Variables](#gecv) \n* [Imapct of Drug Dosage & Interval on MoA](#dosage)\n* [Mechanism of Action Variables](#moa) \n* [Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction](#pca) \n* [Random Forest Benchmark model](#model) \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Terminologies<a name=\"terminology\"></a>\n\nWhen I first started out in this competition I had a hard time making sense of all the terminologies related to Genetics since I don't come from a Biology background. Before diving deep into the data, let's first list out all the domain specific terms that will be mentioned multiple times later on in the notebook - \n\n* **Gene** - A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA. Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of the total) are slightly different between people\n\n* **Protein** - Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.\n\n* **Gene Expression** - Gene expression is the process by which the instructions in our DNA are converted into a functional product, such as a protein.Therefore, the thousands of genes expressed in a particular cell determine what that cell can do. A gene expression determines what kind of a function cell will perform in our body. \n\n* **Cell Viability** - Cell viability is a measure of the proportion of live, healthy cells within a population. Cell viability assays are used to determine the overall health of cells, optimize culture or experimental conditions, **and to measure cell survival following treatment with compounds, such as during a drug screen**.\n\n* **Mechanism of Action** - In medicine, a term used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug’s mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of the domain specific terminologies that we will encounter in this dataset, let's import the datasets and dive deep into the data.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing the Raw Datasets<a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\nThe Competiton provides the following files - \n\n```train_features.csv```- Features for the training set.

Here is the [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html) which explains more about Multilabel & Multiclass Classifiers in detail. XGBoost & Logistic Regression models don't support Multilabel Classification out of the box and we would have to wrap them in MultiOutput Classifiers for this problem. We would essentially be training 206 different XGBoost & Logisitc models while using the MultiOutput Classifier wrappers. \n\n\n#### Evaluation Metric - Log Loss\nThe eveluation metric for this competition is Log Loss. The formula for computation of Log Loss metric is below - \n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190620132533/LogLoss.jpg)\n\n\n* N  : no. of samples.\n* M  : no. of attributes.\n* xij : indicates whether ith sample belongs to jth class or not.\n* pij : indicates probability of ith sample belonging to jth class.\n\nAs the predicted probability of the true class gets closer to zero, the loss increases exponentially:\n\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)\n\n\nPlease go through this excellent [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a) if you want to understand more in detail about the math behind computation of log loss and how it works.
