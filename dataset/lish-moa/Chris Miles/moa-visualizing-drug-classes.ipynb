By studying classes, there could be fruitful insights that could help with cross validation and prediction. Although one could just consider the scored targets, I think considering all targets will be the best. \n\n### Class naming convention: \nI will name a class by concatenating the names of the moas present in that class. To delineate scored moas from nonscored moas, I will prepend scored moas with ++ and nonscored moas with --, such as the class \"++dna_inhibitor--rna_synthesis_inhibitor\", which contains an moa from both scored and nonscored moas. \n\nThis is just a starter, and you should go much deeper to see if you can further partition the training set in ways that will hopefully lead to a proper cross validation strategy and better understanding of the feature distribution and the correlation between features and target variables."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \nimport os\n################ Directory path #################\n# This is so we can easily use our code in \n# different environments by only changing these \n# global variables. \nDATA_RAW_PATH = '../input/lish-moa/'\nDATA_INTERIM_PATH = ''","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"########################### Read data ###############################\ntrain_features = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_RAW_PATH}train_features.csv')\ntest_features = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_RAW_PATH}test_features.csv')\ntrain_targets_scored = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_RAW_PATH}train_targets_scored.csv')\ntrain_targets_nonscored = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_RAW_PATH}train_targets_nonscored.csv')\n\n############### All training data in one dataframe ###################\ntrain_df = train_features.set_index('sig_id')\\\n    .join(train_targets_scored.set_index('sig_id'))\\\n    .join(train_targets_nonscored.set_index('sig_id')).reset_index()\n\n################### Feature and target lists ########################\nfeature_cols = train_features.columns[1:].tolist()\ntarget_scored_cols = train_targets_scored.columns[1:].tolist()\ntarget_nonscored_cols = train_targets_nonscored.columns[1:].tolist()\ntarget_all_cols = target_scored_cols + target_nonscored_cols","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"######################## Moa_classes ################################\n# All rows that have identical moa activations are considered \n# to be in the same class.
