Only gene expression and cell viability features are used. Basically we going to replace our targets for both datasets (0 for train and 1 for test), then we going build a classifier which tries to predict which observation belongs to train and which one belongs to test set. If datasets randomly selected from similar roots it should be really hard for the classifier to separate them. But if there is systematic selection differences between train and test sets then classifier should be able to capture this trend.

Feature scaling can both improve model performance and speed up convergence at the same time.In this competition,`Quantile Transformer` Played an important role for scaling of GENE and CELL features reason being this method transforms the features to follow a uniform or a normal distribution. Therefore, for a given feature, this transformation tends to spread out the most frequent values. It also reduces the impact of (marginal) outliers: this is therefore a robust preprocessing scheme.Zero centric data perform better in algorithms like PCA, on the other hand min max scaled data may perform better in neural networks.\n\nMin max scaler and standard scaler are heavily affected by outliers, however gaussian rank scaler yields more robust results.

To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.You’ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.\nEvery data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing the in-cluster sum of squares.\nIn other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.\nThe ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.\n\nThis is a multi-Label problem so applying K-means maybe beneficial.\n\nHere's a short video to refer K-means Clustering.
