Scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. Mechanism-of-action (MoA) is a label that describes the biological activity of a given molecule. One approach is to treat a sample of human cells with the drug and then analyze the cellular responses with algorithms that search for similarity to known patterns in large genomic databases, such as libraries of gene expression or cell viability patterns of drugs with known MoAs. For this competition, we will be predicting the probability that the sample(sig_id) had a positive response for each MoA target , given various inputs such as gene expression data and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cells’ responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). Drugs can have multiple MoA annotations, so the task is formally a multi-label classification problem. The solution presented examines Rakeld classifier [5] from Scikit-multilearn,a library for multi-label classification."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"s1\"></a>\n### <font color='blue'> Importing libraries </font>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing                            \nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA, FastICA\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom keras.models import Sequential \nfrom keras import models, utils,backend\nimport keras.utils \nfrom keras.optimizers import Adam   \nfrom keras import layers \nfrom keras.layers import Activation, Dense ,Dropout, BatchNormalization, Input,LeakyReLU\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\nfrom keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping ,ModelCheckpoint,ReduceLROnPlateau\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom keras.models import model_from_json  \n\n\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('../input/iterative-stratification/iterative-stratification-master')\nfrom iterstrat.ml_stratifiers import MultilabelStratifiedKFold\n\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <font color='blue'> Loading datasets </font>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trainf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_features.csv')\ntestf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/test_features.csv')\nsub = pd.read_csv('../input/lish-moa/sample_submission.csv')\ntargets = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_targets_scored.csv')\ntargets1 = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_targets_nonscored.csv')\n\ntrain = trainf[trainf.cp_type != 'ctl_vehicle'].drop(columns=['cp_type'])\ntest = testf[testf.cp_type != 'ctl_vehicle'].drop(columns=['cp_type'])\nAtrain = train\nAtest = test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015695,"end_time":"2020-11-02T17:11:23.578847","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-02T17:11:23.563152","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"s3\"></a>\n## <font color='blue'> Exploring the data</font>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will load two data sets, train and test.
