Data augmentation will allow to build robust models under given circumstances.\nWhat augmentations/filers might work:\n* flipping images horizontally and vertically, because the orientation of original images is different;\n* crop-resize, because we can see spikes at different zoom levels;\n* different filters to adjust the lighting conditions. I suggest looking at [this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) for example.\n\nWhat to do with caution:\n* rotation might not work, because rotation messes up the bounding boxes.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Example augmentation pipeline:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# setup an example augmentation pipeline\n# be sure to use bbox safe functions for data augmentation\nexample_transforms = albu.Compose([\n    albu.RandomSizedBBoxSafeCrop(512, 512, erosion_rate=0.0, interpolation=1, p=1.0),\n    albu.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),\n    albu.VerticalFlip(p=0.5),\n    albu.OneOf([albu.RandomContrast(),\n                albu.RandomGamma(),\n                albu.RandomBrightness()], p=1.0),\n    albu.CLAHE(p=1.0)], p=1.0, bbox_params=albu.BboxParams(format='coco', label_fields=['category_id']))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def apply_transforms(transforms, df, n_transforms=3):\n    idx = np.random.randint(len(df), size=1)[0]\n    \n    image_id = df.iloc[idx].image_id\n    bboxes = []\n    for _, row in df[df.image_id == image_id].iterrows():\n        bboxes.append([row.bbox_xmin, row.bbox_ymin, row.bbox_width, row.bbox_height])\n        \n    image = Image.open(TRAIN_DIR + image_id + '.jpg')\n    \n    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, n_transforms+1, figsize=(15,7))\n    \n    # plot the original image\n    axs[0].imshow(image)\n    axs[0].set_title('original')\n    for bbox in bboxes:\n        rect = patches.Rectangle((bbox[0],bbox[1]),bbox[2],bbox[3],linewidth=1,edgecolor='r',facecolor='none')\n        axs[0].add_patch(rect)\n    \n    # apply transforms n_transforms times\n    for i in range(n_transforms):\n        params = {'image': np.asarray(image),\n                  'bboxes': bboxes,\n                  'category_id': [1 for j in range(len(bboxes))]}\n        augmented_boxes = transforms(**params)\n        bboxes_aug = augmented_boxes['bboxes']\n        image_aug = augmented_boxes['image']\n\n        # plot the augmented image and augmented bounding boxes\n        axs[i+1].imshow(image_aug)\n        axs[i+1].set_title('augmented_' + str(i+1))\n        for bbox in bboxes_aug:\n            rect = patches.Rectangle((bbox[0],bbox[1]),bbox[2],bbox[3],linewidth=1,edgecolor='r',facecolor='none')\n            axs[i+1].add_patch(rect)\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apply_transforms(example_transforms, all_train_images, n_transforms=3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apply_transforms(example_transforms, all_train_images, n_transforms=3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note how CLAHE emphasizes the features in darker spots.

[Fine-grained recognition of plants from images](https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0265-4). Fine-grained recognition of plants from images is a challenging computer vision task, due to the diverse appearance and complex structure of plants, high intra-class variability and small inter-class differences. We review the state-of-the-art and discuss plant recognition tasks, from identification of plants from specific plant organs to general plant recognition “in the wild”.\n3.
