Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored using RMSPE (root mean squared percentage error) which can be denoted as\n\n$\\huge \\text{RMSPE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} ((y_i - \\hat{y}_i)/y_i)^2}$\n\nRMSPE is very similar to RMSE. The only difference between them is, the error is divided by the actual value. Predictions closer to actual values yield errors closer to 0, so division by actual values is sensitive to larger errors. In addition to that, errors are squared before they are averaged, which makes this metric even more sensitive to larger errors. This means larger errors are not tolerable in this domain.\n\nOne pitfall of RMSPE is it can raise ZeroDivisionError if a single data point in actual values is equal to 0. Even though, there isn't any 0 target values in training set, this can be easily solved by adding a small constant to actual values. A small constant epsilon wouldn't contribute to overall rmspe and it prevents ZeroDivisionError.\n\nFor baselines, global target mean scores **1.11033**, target mean of stock_ids scores **0.789618**, and target median of stock_ids scores **0.589135**  on training set.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def root_mean_squared_percentage_error(y_true, y_pred, epsilon=1e-10):\n    \n    rmspe = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square((y_true - y_pred) / (y_true + epsilon))))\n    return rmspe\n\n\ntarget_mean_rmspe = root_mean_squared_percentage_error(df_train['target'], np.repeat(df_train['target'].mean(), len(df_train)))\nprint(f'target Mean RMPSE: {target_mean_rmspe:.6}')\n\nstock_id_target_mean_rmspe = root_mean_squared_percentage_error(df_train['target'], df_train.groupby('stock_id')['target'].transform('mean'))\nprint(f'stock_id target Mean RMPSE: {stock_id_target_mean_rmspe:.6}')\n\nstock_id_target_median_rmspe = root_mean_squared_percentage_error(df_train['target'], df_train.groupby('stock_id')['target'].transform('median'))\nprint(f'stock_id target Median RMPSE: {stock_id_target_median_rmspe:.6}')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-20T06:11:44.58013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-20T06:11:44.580653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-20T06:11:44.639427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-20T06:11:44.580599Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-20T06:11:44.638471Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

Order Book\n\nOrder book is a list of buy and sell orders organized by price level for given stocks. An order book lists the number of shares being bid on or asked at each price point. Order books help to improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability and depth of trade.\n\nOrder book data files are named as `book_train.parquet` and `book_test.parquet`, and they are parquet files partitioned by stock_id column. Partitioned by stock_id means those files can both read as whole or individual stocks. However, reading them as a single file is not easy as they will consume too much memory.\n\nThere are 10 columns in every book data partition. The columns are:\n\n* `time_id` - ID of the time bucket\n* `seconds_in_bucket` - Number of seconds passed since the start of the bucket\n* `bid_price1` - Highest buy price after normalization\n* `ask_price1` - Lowest sell price after normalization\n* `bid_price2` - Second highest buy price after normalization\n* `ask_price2` - Second lowest sell price after normalization\n* `bid_size1` - Number of shares on the highest buy price\n* `ask_size1` - Number of shares on the lowest sell price\n* `bid_size2` - Number of shares on the second highest buy price\n* `ask_size2` - Number of shares on the second lowest sell price\n\nValues in order book are the last snapshots of each second. Some of the seconds are not available because there weren't any related market activities during those seconds, thus order books are not updated. Normally, given order books last 600 seconds for every time bucket. Values of the missing seconds are the values at the last updated second, so the book data can be reindexed to 600 seconds for every time bucket and missing values can be forward filled for every field.

Feature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering is very important in this competition because it won't be easy to use neural networks directly on time buckets. Previously, realized volatilities of current 10 minute window were extracted from WAP1 and WAP2, but the same aggregation can be applied to any sequence since it tells the total amount of movement happened in it. Other simple aggregations like mean, standard deviation, min and max can also be used for feature engineering.\n\nA very simple feature bid_ask_price_ratio is created while iterating over order books. Multiple aggregations on that simple feature might yield valuable information about realized volatility of the next 10 minute window. Aggregations on simple features like that or aggregations on raw sequences is the most straightforward way of feature engineering.
