I'd like to figure out if it's caused by my wrong assumptions of the data (particularly for pairs of (stock_id, time_id)).\n\nIn this notebook, we derive a formula to manipulate the RMSPE score, so we can get some metadata of the test set. The formula can display any number that are >= 1.\n\n> !!! PLEASE NOTE: The intention of this notebook is not cheating, violating the rule or doing anything weried!\n\n> !!
