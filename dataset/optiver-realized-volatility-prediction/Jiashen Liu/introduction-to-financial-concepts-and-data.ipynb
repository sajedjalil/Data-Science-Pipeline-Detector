An order book lists the number of shares being bid on or offered at each price point.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of an order book of a stock (let's call it stock A), as you can see, all intended buy orders are on the left side of the book displayed as \"bid\" while all intended sell orders are on the right side of the book displayed as \"offer/ask\"\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![order_book_1](https://www.optiver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/OrderBook3.png)\n\nAn actively traded financial instrument always has a dense order book (A liquid book).

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Trade\nAn order book is a representation of trading intention on the market, however the market needs a buyer and seller at the **same** price to make the trade happen. Therefore, sometimes when someone wants to do a trade in a stock, they check the order book and find someone with counter-interest to trade with. \n\nFor example, imagine you want to buy 20 shares of a stock A when you have the order book in the previous paragraph. Then you need to find some people who are willing to trade against you by selling 20 shares or more in total. You check the **offer** side of the book starting from the lowest price: there are 221 shares of selling interest on the level of 148. You can **lift** 20 shares for a price of 148 and **guarantee** your execution. This will be the resulting order book of stock A after your trade:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![order_book2](https://www.optiver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/OrderBook4.png)\n\nIn this case, the seller(s) sold 20 shares and buyer bought 20 shares, the exchange will match the order between seller(s) and buyer and one trade message will be broadcast to public:\n\n- 20 shares of stock A traded on the market at price of 148.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similar to order book data, trade data is also extremely crucial to Optiver's data scientists, as it reflects how active the market is.

If you get unlucky, the price goes up, and others start bidding at 149, and you never get to buy at all. Alternatively, you could insert an order to buy at 155. The exchange would match this order against the outstanding sell order of one share at 149, so you buy 1 lot at 149. Similarly, you'd buy 12 shares at a price of 150, and 7 shares at 151. Compared to trying to buy at 148, there is no risk of not getting the trade that you wanted, but you do end up buying at a higher price.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see that in such an inefficient market it is difficult to trade, as trading will be more expensive, and if you want quality execution of your orders, you need to deal with higher market risk. That is why investors love liquidity, and market makers like Optiver are there to provide it, no matter how extreme market conditions are.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A market maker is a firm or individual who actively quotes two-sided markets in a security, providing bids and offers (known as asks) along with the market size of each.

A fair book-based valuation must take two factors into account: the level and the size of orders. In this competition we used weighted averaged price, or WAP, to calculate the instantaneous stock valuation and calculate realized volatility as our target. \n\nThe formula of WAP can be written as below, which takes the top level price and volume information into account:\n\n$$ WAP = \\frac{BidPrice_{1}*AskSize_{1} + AskPrice_{1}*BidSize_{1}}{BidSize_{1} + AskSize_{1}} $$\n\nAs you can see, if two books have both bid and ask offers on the same price level respectively, the one with more offers in place will generate a lower stock valuation, as there are more intended seller in the book, and more seller implies a fact of more supply on the market resulting in a lower stock valuation.\n\nNote that in most of cases, during the continuous trading hours, an order book should not have the scenario when bid order is higher than the offer, or ask, order. In another word, most likely, the bid and ask should never be **in cross.**\n\nIn this competition the target is constructed from the WAP. The WAP of the order book snapshot is 147.5317797.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Log returns\n\n**How can we compare the price of a stock between yesterday and today?**\n\nThe easiest method would be to just take the difference. This is definitely the most intuitive way, however **price differences** are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested $\\$$1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from $\\$$100 to $\\$$102 and stock B moves from $\\$$10 to $\\$$11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ($\\$1000 \\ / \\ \\$100 = 10$) which led to a profit of $10 \\cdot (\\$102 - \\$100) = \\$20$ and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock **A**, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n\nWe can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the **stock return**. In our example, the return for stock A was $\\frac{\\$102 - \\$100 }{\\$100} = 2\\%$, while for stock B it was $\\frac{\\$11 - \\$10 }{\\$10} = 10\\%$. The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however **log returns** are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling $S_t$ the price of the stock $S$ at time $t$, we can define the log return between $t_1$ and $t_2$ as:\n$$\nr_{t_1, t_2} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}} \\right)\n$$\nUsually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean $r_t = r_{t - 10 min, t}$.\n\nLog returns present several advantages, for example:\n- they are additive across time $r_{t_1, t_2} + r_{t_2, t_3} = r_{t_1, t_3}$\n- regular returns cannot go below -100%, while log returns are not bounded","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Realized volatility\nWhen we trade options, a valuable input to our models is the standard deviation of the stock log returns. The standard deviation will be different for log returns computed over longer or shorter intervals, for this reason it is usually normalized to a 1-year period and the annualized standard deviation is called **volatility**. \n\nIn this competition, you will be given 10 minutes of book data and we ask you to predict what the volatility will be in the following 10 minutes. Volatility will be measured as follows:\n\nWe will compute the log returns over all consecutive book updates and we define the **realized volatility, $\\sigma$,** as the squared root of the sum of squared log returns.\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{t}r_{t-1, t}^2}\n$$\nWhere we use **WAP** as price of the stock to compute log returns.\n\nWe want to keep definitions as simple and clear as possible, so that Kagglers without financial knowledge will not be penalized. So we are not annualizing the volatility and we are assuming that log returns have 0 mean.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Competition data\nIn this competition, Kagglers are challenged to generate a series of short-term signals from the book and trade data of a fixed 10-minute window to predict the realized volatility of the next 10-minute window.
