I have done this to make it a bit easier to see the data. However, as the reader you need to be aware that the sacale is off and although the UK and Canada seem close, they are actually over a 100k difference as of April 26th. So keep this in mind. \n\nThis graph is very interesting, in that the UK had a huge spike in cases, starting March 16th that has almost gone out of control. This resulted in the country entering lockdown for a month a week later, which has been extended for another 3 weeks. \n\nIn comparison, NZ hasn't really had a spike, but they entered lockdown on the 25th of March, which has been extended until April 25th. This has resulted in cases being supressed to the point of having very few daily cases in their most recent updates (as of April 21st). \n\nAlternatively, Australia and Canada have allowed states / provinces to guide lockdown protocols. In both cases, most essential business are all that remain open, with some state / provinces placing a lockdown on their residents. In Canada, BC has stated they have always not been willing to place residents in lockdown, saying this would be too detrimental to their health. Which appears to be similar to the approach of Australia. In these circumstances, either luck or obiding citizens have helped to keep case numbers low, with BC currently on 1600 and Australia on around 6000. This points to an approach that has worked well in both cases. But parts of both countries have also seen spikes that have struggled to maintain, with reporting in provinces of Canada also different compared to others (probable cases being included for example). \n\nEither way, all 4 countries have taken differing approaches with outcomes that are from one extreme to the other almost.
