In addition, it is apparent here that the original radiographs have been preprocessed for us as follows:\n\n* The relatively high dynamic range, high bit-depth original images have been rescaled to 8-bit encoding (256 grayscales). For the radiologists out there, this means that the images have been windowed and leveled already. In clinical practice, manipulating the image bit-depth is typically done manually by a radiologist to highlight certain disease processes. To visually assess the quality of the automated bit-depth downscaling and for considerations on potentially improving this baseline, consider consultation with a radiologist physician.\n\n* The relativley large original image matrices (typically acquired at >2000 x 2000) have been resized to the data-science friendly shape of 1024 x 1024. For the purposes of this challenge, the diagnosis of most pneumonia cases can typically be made at this resolution. To visually assess the feasibility of diagnosis at this resolution, and to determine the optimal resolution for pneumonia detection (oftentimes can be done at a resolution *even smaller* than 1024 x 1024), consider consultation with a radiogist physician.\n\n## Visualizing An Example\n\nTo take a look at this first DICOM image, let's use the `pylab.imshow()` method:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"59ac176a83e8fc1f11531a216723791577948fbe"},"cell_type":"code","source":"pylab.imshow(im, cmap=pylab.cm.gist_gray)\npylab.axis('off')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"78c0e24742ce4f61c153f363e66ac5d7e5efbb0e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploring the Data and Labels\n\nAs alluded to above, any given patient may potentially have many boxes if there are several different suspicious areas of pneumonia.
