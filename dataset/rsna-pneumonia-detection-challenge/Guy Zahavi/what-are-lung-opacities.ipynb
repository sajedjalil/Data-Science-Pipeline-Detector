But the title **\"Pneumonia Detection\"** for the competition is misleading because you actually have to do **\"Lung Opacities Detection\"**, and lung opacities are not the same as pneumonia. Lung opacities are vague, fuzzy clouds of white in the darkness of the lungs, which makes detecting them a real challenge.\n\nThis kernel is for people who want to understand what lung opacities are and how come there are \"No Lung Opacity / Not Normal\" images. In this kernel I will show images from different classes (Normal; No Lung Opacity / Not Normal; Lung Opacity) and write my interpretation of the **opacities** in the image. I will cover some basics of chest radiography and focus only on the lungs because \"Lung Opacities\" appear only in the lungs. Write your questions in the comments section and I'll answer them as best that I can.\n\nMy name is Guy Zahavi, I am a physician (anesthesiology resident) and graduate bioinformatics student. I am not affiliated with the competition hosts or Kaggle, I'm just excited about this competition :)\n\n*I took the code for this kernel from Peter Chang's awesome [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/peterchang77/exploratory-data-analysis).

I don't think you can properly segment opacities out of the entire picture because there are no clear boundries. However, if you can segment the lungs properly and filter out the rest of the image, you could create a clean image of the lungs for your neural network to process *(clean as in data cleaning, not clean of pneumonia or opacities)*. An implementation of [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for such a segmentation can be seen at [Lesson 2: Lung X-Rays Semantic Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mdai/ml-lessons/blob/master/lesson2-lung-xrays-segmentation.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n\n## How accurate are the annotated boxes?\n*In reply to [Arya Mazaheri](https://www.kaggle.com/aryanet) and [Mikheil Azatov](https://www.kaggle.com/mazatov)*\n\nThere is a known variability between radiologists in the interpretation of chest radiographs. In a study by [Neuman et al. (2012)](https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/126918/reliability-cxr-pneumonia), there was only a moderate level of agreement between radiologists about the presence of **infiltrates**, which are opacities by definition.\nGoing through the images of this competition, I believe that the presence and position of the annotated boxes would vary between different radiologists."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"011f156c8ae9a5ca2c99f5aeb0ccff3cc0f10c09"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# A Closer Look Into \"No Lung Opacity / Not Normal\" Images\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b119a89ca81d3027842867b2e44b925676f94ba4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"patientId = df['patientId'][2]\nprint(patient_class.loc[patientId])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.title(\"Sample Patient 3 - Lung Nodules and Masses\")\ndraw(parsed[patientId])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"00d0de576cad3a712e5c247a71a2f11dc850efa0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**There are obvious opacities in this image, so what's going on??**\n\nThis patient has a \"Target\" value of 0 in the stage_1_train_labels.csv file, which means he does not have a diagnosis of peumonia. *\"There is also a binary target column, Target, indicating pneumonia or non-pneumonia\" - from the [Data description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data) page*.\n\n## Why are there multiple opacities in No Lung Opacity / Not Normal images?\n\nI'm afraid this competition is misleading in many ways. There are different kinds of opacities (see a general explanation about opacities above). Some are related to pneumonia and some are not. What we see in the image of Patient 3 are Lung Nodules and Masses, which are defined as *\"a rounded opacity, well or poorly defined\" - [Felson's Principles of Chest Roentgenology (Fourth Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Felsons-Principles-Roentgenology-Programmed-Goodman/dp/1455774839?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1455774839).* The difference between a **nodule** and a **mass** is the size of the opacity.

Other non-pneumonia opacities may be present. Also, some of the not normal cases have subtle abnormalities which require a trained eye to discern. (Which, for now, keeps radiologists around.)\n\nIn the next section I'll try to put it all together and give a clear definition of the opacities annotated in this data set.\n\n\n# A Clear and Detailed Definition of Pneumonia Associated Lung Opacities\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nWhy does the chest radiograph change when a person has pneumonia? To answer this question we have to ask what is pneumonia first.\n\n![Pneumonia](https://jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/934929/m_jpg160003fa.png)\nCredit: Thompson AE. [Pneumonia. *JAMA.*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2488310) 2016;315(6):626. \n\nPneumonia is a lung infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Because of the infection and the body's immune response, the sacks in the lungs *(termed alveoli)* are filled with fluids instead of air. The reason that **pneumonia associated lung opacities** look diffuse on the chest radiograph is because the infection and fluid that accumulate spread within the normal tree of airways in the lung. There is no clear border where the infection stops. That is different from other diseases like tumors, which are totally different from the normal lung, and do not maintain the normal structure of the airways inside the lung.\n\n## Consolidation vs. Ground-Glass Opacity\n\nLet's compare two patients -"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fbaef3b1dfbe13ead6d21669c93613a2a6491c51","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20, 40))\n\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.title(\"Sample Patient 4 - Ground-Glass Opacities\")\ndraw(parsed[df['patientId'][25]])\nprint(patient_class.loc[df['patientId'][25]])\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.title(\"Sample Patient 5 - Consolidations\")\ndraw(parsed[df['patientId'][28]])\nprint(patient_class.loc[df['patientId'][28]])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2d29e8765df2d896df528f7f59e6e927f0391078"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Patient 4 - **Ground-Glass Opacities**: We can see that the lungs are \"whiter\" than they should be, but we can see most of the borders of the lungs and heart. \n**Ground-Glass Opacity** definition - *\"On chest radiographs, **ground-glass opacity** appears as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, usually extensive, within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct.

The answer is **yes and no**. An opacity can occur where the lung was once, but it cannot be a **lung opacity**. This **white lung** phenomena in chest radiographs is termed \"hemithorax white-out\" or \"hemithorax opacity\". \n\nSeeing a \"white lung\" on a chest radiograph leads to the question - **if we see only an opacity where the lung is supposed to be, what happened to lung?**. These are some possible answers:\n- The lung was removed in a surgery called **pneumonectomy**.\n- The lung is filled with fluid from pneumonia and what we see is a **[pneumonia associated lung opacity](#A-Clear-and-Detailed-Definition-of-Pneumonia-Associated-Lung-Opacities)**. \n- The lung is there but it is surrounded by fluids inside the chest cavity (termed **[pleural effusion](#Pleural-effusion)**).\nIt's hard to tell just by the chest radiograph what is the cause of the \"white lung\". \n\nSince this competition is about penumonia, and these patients have a \"Target\" value of 1, the cause for their big opacity is most probably pneumonia. Meaning - they have a **pneumonia associated lung opacity** over their entire lung.\n\nYou can see more examples of \"white lungs\" in [this radiopedia artice](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hemithorax-white-out-differential).\n\n## Unclear Abnormality\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f13e0083737ddb3724e6926a5beaea39c6dbce96"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20, 40))\n\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.title(\"Sample Patient 6 - Normal\")\ndraw(parsed[df['patientId'][59]])\nprint(patient_class.loc[df['patientId'][59]])\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.title(\"Sample Patient 12 - Unclear Abnormality\")\ndraw(parsed[df['patientId'][40]])\nprint(patient_class.loc[df['patientId'][40]])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ec3bf8a36ce264c72a193be0770094c66e96abf4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Patient 12 - I can't see a clear reason for this image to be abnormal.
