A good picture of homeless animal might increase their chance of getting adopted. But what makes a good picture? Our mission is to build an ML model which is able to accurately determine a pet photo's appeal and even suggest improvements to give these rescue animals a higher chance of loving homes.\n\nThis competition is organized by PetFinder.my. They are Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform, featuring 180,000 animals with 54,000 happily adopted. Good and accurate model might have a change to be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world to improve the photo quality of their sheltered pet. \n\n**Data:** 9912 images of pet animals labeled with \"Pawpularity\" score from 1 to 100. Photo Metadata = (Focus, Eyes, Face, Near, Action, Accessory, Group, Collage, Human, Occlusion, Info, Blur)\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvhLlXxXgAA5TDJ.jpg)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

EfficientNet took me 10 GPU hours and SWIN transform model took me 20 GPU hours to finish training all the Folds. EfficientNet was quick to train but require many epoches to reach the global optimum, thus Early Stopping function was necessary to get best model. On other hand, SWIN Transform took very long time to train as the architecture of the model is very complicated compared to EfficientNet, but it was able to reach global optimum much quicker compared to EfficientNet. It may be faster to train by using 4 epoches to train instead of using Early Stopping.","metadata":{}}]}
