Let's put our attention on the top 5 states that were stated in the dataset, namely <b>Connecticut, Utah, Massachusetts, Illinois and California</b>\n\nBased on the information from the articles named below, many public schools in the United States were closed due to mitigation measures for the Coronavirus in middle to late March 2020. For the top 5 schools that were aforementioned in the previous paragraph, it was found that these schools were all closed during this period of time. It was also mentioned that most schools will be operating through online platforms. This tallies with the graphs we plotted, as they show clear representations of a slight increase between the month of March 2020 and April 2020. \n\nAs of why there was a slight increase and not a huge spike in the trend observed, one possible reason may be due to the lack of preparation by the school. As suggested by NCES Blog, in the 2017–18 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2018, there was less than 50% of public school (46%) that had written plan in the scenario of pandemic disease. This may be a factor which led to the aforementioned observation as schools may lack the readiness in preparing education materials for the students when such an event occured. Things such as setting up infrastructure for the students to access the materials remotely or converting the conventional offline teaching materials to online may be challenges faced by schools who lacked the necessary preparations. \n\nThe next interesting observation will be the declining trend observed between April 2020 and July 2020, especially the sharp decline starting from May 2020. One plausible reason may be due to a decrease in productivity of the educators in the United States. According to EdWeek Research Center Survey, 2020, there was a decrease in morality amongst the educator during these period of time. From the same source, an abstract of an interview with an educator suggested that conducting lessons remotely may be more taxing as compared to conventional offline teaching. These factors may lead to the fall in quantities of online education materials available to the students, leading to the decline in engaging the learning tools and digital platforms amongst the students.\n\nWhile the above mentioned may suggest a declining trend over time, the reality was in fact the reverse. An intriguing trend reversal was spotted starting from July 2020 (monthly mean) and from Aug 2020 (montly median). One possible explanation can be due to different mitigation measures implemented by the government of their respective States. In the case of the top 5 States (July 2020),according to BALLOTPEDIA, Utah and California continued their closure of schools, Connecticut allowed the choice of fully reopening their school or undergoing a hybrid plan of partially re-opening of the schools (some lessons will still be online), while Illinois and Massachuesetts allowed their schools to be fully reopened. As we can see, starting from this period of time, states differ in practices. Our graphs plotted take into account of districts with missing values for their States. Hence, we will need to do more data manipulation to see if such a trend still persist.\n\n\nArticles:\n- https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-coronavirus-spring-the-historic-closing-of-u-s-schools-a-timeline/2020/07\n- https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/the-prevalence-of-written-plans-for-a-pandemic-disease-scenario-in-public-schools\n- https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_Connecticut_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic\n- https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_Utah_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic\n- https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_Massachusetts_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic\n- https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_Illinois_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic\n- https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_California_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic\n- https://www.ajmc.com/view/a-timeline-of-covid19-developments-in-2020\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
