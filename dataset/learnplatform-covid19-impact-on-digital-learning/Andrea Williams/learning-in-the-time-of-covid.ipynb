Schools, students, parents and teachers had to rapidly adjust to radically different methods of teaching and learning.\n\nEven before the pandemic began, the US public education system was already pretty unequal and divided across geography, demographics, and socioeconomics. With the closure of schools and the transition to at-home online learning, there was a risk that already disadvantaged students could succumb to even greater disadvantages if they were having to study from home without adequate Internet connectivity, regular access to Internet-capable devices, support from their schools, or if they were in living situations that, for one reason or another, were not conducive to productive study sessions.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to answer: If another state of emergency were to arise in the future that caused the widespread closure of in-person classrooms, to be replaced with online classrooms, what can state governments and school districts do to better support their grade-school students next time?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly import subplots\nimport plotly.offline as pyo\nimport json\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n\ndistrict_files = []\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('../input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/engagement_data'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        district_files.append(filename)\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session\n\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None  # default='warn'","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.355859Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.356857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.404461Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.356817Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.403417Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pyo.init_notebook_mode()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.406054Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.40756Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.531688Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.407484Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:42:45.530682Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"districts = pd.read_csv('../input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/districts_info.csv')\n# drop rows where every column except for district_id is NaN -

For instance, district 8815 in Illinois (in yellow) shows much higher student engagement in September compared to the last few months of the previous school year. This suggests that the administrative team in this particular school district used the summer months to put in place a plan for managing online learning.\n\nConversely, we can see that district 9536 in New York (in purple) made very little use of online learning products before the pandemic was declared. In early April 2020, this particular school district quickly adopted online education products and had some of the highest daily page load event numbers of all reporting districts in the country. However, starting with the new school year in September, their page load events decreased somewhat lower than what was seen at the end of the 2019-20 school year. This could possibly indicate that schools in this NY district returned to in-person classes (or a hybrid of online and in-person) for the 2020-21 school year, but continued to use online learning platforms much more prominently than they did before the pandemic began.\n\nBy looking at the overall trend of student engagement for all school districts reporting data, we can see that even in the later months of 2020, when it is likely that many schools had re-opened for in-person instruction, online learning products were still being used much more commonly than they had been in the first few months of 2020.

In fact, districts with 40-60% and 80-100% of students on free lunch programs showed very similar results in the mean daily percentage of students accessing online learning resources. Strangely, the percentage access drops by 25% in districts where 60-80% of the students are on free lunch programs.\n\nSome encouraging news is that districts with 80-100% of their students in free lunch programs had nearly as many page load events per student per day, on average, as districts where less than 20% of students had free lunches. This suggests that in these school districts where the large majority of students come from poor families, there are supports in place to encourage those students to participate in school. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case in districts where 60-80% of students eat free lunches.\n\nWe can also see from the spread over mean daily page load events that a student's (or school district's) socioeconomic status had a greater effect on their online participation than the student's ethnicity did.\n\nThe wealthiest school districts (less than 20% of students getting free lunches) reported the highest percentage of daily online access. This is to be expected, given that families with more wealth are more likely to be able to afford home Internet connections and personal devices to allow students to access the Internet either from home or at school.\n\nAlso noticeable is that school districts where less than 20% of students identify as Black or Hispanic reported similar daily percentage access numbers to school districts where 60% or more of students were Black or Hispanic. It would appear that districts with a more equal spread of ethnicities (20-60% of students Black or Hispanic) were the least likely to access online school resources on a daily basis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"top_5_all_districts.rename({'Funding_per_student_[10000, 12000[': 'Student_funding_10k-12k', 'Funding_per_student_[18000, 20000[': 'Student_funding_18k-20k', 'Funding_per_student_[12000, 14000[': 'Student_funding_12k-14k', 'Funding_per_student_[14000, 16000[': 'Student_funding_14k-16k', 'Funding_per_student_[16000, 18000[': 'Student_funding_16k-18k', 'Funding_per_student_[20000, 22000[': 'Student_funding_20k-22k', 'Funding_per_student_[22000, 24000[': 'Student_funding_22k-24k', 'Funding_per_student_[32000, 34000[': 'Student_funding_32k-34k', 'Funding_per_student_[4000, 6000[': 'Student_funding_4k-6k', 'Funding_per_student_[6000, 8000[': 'Student_funding_6k-8k', 'Funding_per_student_[8000, 10000[': 'Student_funding_8k-10k'}, axis=1, inplace=True)\n\ndfs = []\nselect_by = ['Student_funding_4k-6k',\n       'Student_funding_6k-8k', 'Student_funding_8k-10k', 'Student_funding_10k-12k',\n       'Student_funding_12k-14k', 'Student_funding_14k-16k',\n       'Student_funding_16k-18k', 'Student_funding_18k-20k',\n       'Student_funding_20k-22k', 'Student_funding_22k-24k',\n       'Student_funding_32k-34k']\n\nfor i in range(len(select_by)):\n    df = top_5_all_districts.groupby(select_by[i]).agg({'engagement_index': 'mean', 'pct_access': 'mean'})\n    df['per_student_funding'] = select_by[i][16:]\n    df['num_districts'] = int(top_5_all_districts[select_by[i]].value_counts()[1] / 5)\n    dfs.append(df[df.index == 1])\n\nengagement_by_student_funding = pd.concat(dfs)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.222227Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.222449Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.272473Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.222425Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.271355Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = subplots.make_subplots(\n    rows=2, \n    cols=1, \n    horizontal_spacing = 0.15, \n    vertical_spacing = 0.18, \n    shared_yaxes = True\n )\n\ntrace = go.Scatter(x=engagement_by_student_funding['per_student_funding'], y=engagement_by_student_funding['engagement_index'], mode='lines+markers+text', marker_color='black', line_color='black', showlegend=False)\n\nfig.add_trace(trace, 1, 1)\n\ntrace = go.Scatter(x=engagement_by_student_funding['per_student_funding'], y=engagement_by_student_funding['pct_access'], mode='lines+markers+text', marker_color='black', line_color='black', showlegend=False)\n\nfig.add_trace(trace, 2, 1)\n\nlarge_title_format = \"<span style='font-size:26px; font-family:Times New Roman'>Online Student Engagement by Funding per Student</span>\"\nsmall_title_format = \"<span style='font-size:14px; font-family:Helvetica'>Mean daily page load events and percentage of students accessing online-based school<br>software broken down by per-student funding allocated to the school district.</span>\"\n\nfig.update_xaxes(title_text=\"Per-student funding\", col=1)\n\nfig.update_yaxes(title_text=\"Daily Page Load Events per Student\", row=1)\nfig.update_yaxes(title_text=\"Daily Percentage Access\", row=2)\n\n\nlayout = dict(title = large_title_format + '<br>' + small_title_format,\n    margin = dict(t=200, b=60, r=20),\n    width = 700,\n    height=700,\n    yaxis = dict(range=[0,10000], showgrid=True), \n    yaxis2 = dict(range=[0, 20], showgrid=True))\n\nfig.update_layout(layout)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.273742Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.274005Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.321604Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.273969Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.320726Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These graphs clearly show that online student engagement is lowest in school districts with the least funding allocated per student.

We can see from the output that both of the relevant school districts are in Utah, and both have less than 20% of students identifying as Black or Hispanic. In one of the school districts, less than 20% of students are in free or reduced lunch programs, and in the other, 20-40% of students were on free or reduced lunch.\n\nThis would indicate that the communities that these two school districts are located in are probably relatively wealthy. Note that according to the \"Online Student Engagement by Ethnicity and Socioeconomics\" chart, one would expect some of the highest page load events/student and percentage access (approximately 5,300 - 7,100 page load events per day per student, on average, and 12.5-15% daily access). Instead, the Utah school district with less than 20% of students on free/reduced lunches had an engagement index of 4700 page load events per student per day, and approx. 10% of students used an online product on any given day. In the Utah school district where 20-40% of students are on free/reduced lunches, there was a very low average of 1092 page load events per student per day, and only an average of 2.9% of students accessed an online product on any given day. Because the school districts have been anonymized in the dataset, there is no additional information available to be able to determine the reason why both of these school districts (and one in particular) had so little online student engagement.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting (and will be shown in Utah's state chart below), Utah's overall student engagement was generally lower than many other states. It is possible that the state Department of Education for Utah does not encourage or support online schooling to the same extent as other state education departments do. Alternatively, (or perhaps additionally), there could be other demographic factors at play, such as Utah's historically homogeneous distributions of political leanings and religion.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"series_list = []\nstates_list = top_5_all_districts['state'].unique()\nfunding_levels = ['Student_funding_4k-6k',\n       'Student_funding_6k-8k', 'Student_funding_8k-10k', 'Student_funding_10k-12k',\n       'Student_funding_12k-14k', 'Student_funding_14k-16k',\n       'Student_funding_16k-18k', 'Student_funding_18k-20k',\n       'Student_funding_20k-22k', 'Student_funding_22k-24k',\n       'Student_funding_32k-34k']\n\nfor state in states_list:\n    state_dict = {}\n    state_dict['state'] = state\n    for level in funding_levels:\n        df = top_5_all_districts[(top_5_all_districts['state'] == state) & (top_5_all_districts[level] == 1)]\n        val = df.shape[0]/5\n        state_dict[level] = int(val)\n    series_list.append(pd.Series(state_dict))\n\nstudent_funding_by_state = pd.concat(series_list, axis=1)\nstudent_funding_by_state = student_funding_by_state.transpose()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.386701Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.386979Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.574825Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.38693Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.573879Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"states_dict = {}\nfor state in states_list:\n    row = student_funding_by_state.query('state == @state')\n    states_dict[state] = {'state_min': 0, 'state_max': 0}\n    # find min\n    for level in funding_levels:\n        if row[level].values[0] > 0:\n            category = level[16:]\n            floor = int(category.split('-')[0].replace('k', ''))\n            ceil = int(category.split('-')[1].replace('k', ''))\n            states_dict[state]['state_min'] = floor\n            states_dict[state]['state_max'] = ceil\n            break\n    # find max\n    for i in range(len(funding_levels)-1, 0, -1):\n        level = funding_levels[i]\n        if row[level].values[0] > 0:\n            category = level[16:]\n            ceil = int(category.split('-')[1].replace('k', ''))\n            states_dict[state]['state_max'] = ceil\n            break","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.576065Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.576818Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.646562Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.576778Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.645694Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"engagement_by_state = top_5_all_districts.groupby('state').agg({'engagement_index': ['mean', 'max'], 'pct_access': ['mean', 'max']})\ncount_districts_in_state = {}\nfor state_name in engagement_by_state.index:\n    count_districts_in_state[state_name] = int(top_5_all_districts.query('state == @state_name').shape[0]/5)\nengagement_by_state['num_districts'] = count_districts_in_state.values()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.648137Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.648439Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.739237Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.6484Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:43:17.738196Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\n\nfor state in states_dict.keys():\n    if states_dict[state]['state_min'] != 0:\n        state_label = state + ' (' + str(engagement_by_state[engagement_by_state.index == state]['num_districts'].values[0]) + ')'\n        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=np.array(states_dict[state]['state_min']), y=[state_label], mode='markers', marker_color='grey', name='Minimum per-student funding in state (USD$)'))\n        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=np.array(states_dict[state]['state_max']), y=[state_label], mode='markers', marker_color='black', name='Maximum per-student funding in state (USD$)'))\n        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=np.array(engagement_by_state[engagement_by_state.index == state]['engagement_index']['mean'].values[0]/1000), y=[state_label], mode='markers', marker_color='green', name='Mean online student engagement'))\n        fig.add_shape(type='line', x0=states_dict[state]['state_max'], y0=state_label, x1=states_dict[state]['state_min'], y1=state_label, name='Range in per-student funding (USD$)')\n\nlarge_title_format = \"<span style='font-size:26px;

This includes products such as Khan Academy and Study.com. From what could be observed of the available student engagement data, there are substantial differences in online engagement across states. Texas appeared to barely use online education software whatsoever, whereas students in Connecticut were habitual users of learning software.\n\n**What is the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?**\n\nAs was seen in the day-by-day data for Connecticut, online engagement increased immediately when public schools closed their doors in March 2020, and the trend of increased student engagement seen in the last few months of the 2019-2020 school year continued to roughly the same extent at the start of the new 2020-2021 school year. This might suggest that some school districts continued to use certain online learning products, which were originally adopted as a stopgap replacement for in-person learning, in the longer term.\n\nIndeed, when looking at the daily sums of page load events by school district, it is apparent that online education software was being used much more often in the last three months of 2020 compared to the first three months. My hypothesis is that many school districts continued using online software for their classrooms even if schools were open and classes were being held in-person near the end of 2020.\n\n**How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to geographic, demographics, and socioeconomic contexts?**\n\nDistricts with greater per-student funding generally had better engagement. This could be because wealthier school districts can better afford in-classroom computers for online access, and/or can afford to buy the necessary licenses and subscriptions for paid education software. \n\nSchool districts with the fewest number of students enrolled in free or reduced-cost lunch programs had the best online engagement. The most likely cause for this is that if a student is not qualifying for free school lunches, it is most likely because their family's income bracket is relatively high, and consequently, their household is more likely to be able to afford an at-home Internet connection and computers or other electronic devices that can be used for accessing online learning. \n\nData analysis also revealed that the most engaged school districts had relatively homogeneous ethnic distributions, whether that was predominantly Caucasian or predominantly Black/Hispanic. Districts with more equal distributions of ethnicities actually had the lowest online student engagement.\n\n**Do certain state interventions or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease of online engagement?**\n\nIn states with sufficient engagement data, it is observable that online engagement immediately increased when schools were closed. \n\nFrom the student engagement dataset provided, there is little evidence to suggest that state interventions impacted engagement, although I do not believe there is sufficient engagement data available to be able to conclusively say that state interventions were ineffective.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Sources\n\n* Covid-19 in USA (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa) under Apache License 2.0\n* USA Statewise Latest Covid-19 Data (https://www.kaggle.com/anandhuh/usa-statewise-latest-covid19-data)\n* COVID-19 US State Policy Database (https://www.kaggle.com/cavfiumella/covid19-us-state-policy-database)","metadata":{}}]}
