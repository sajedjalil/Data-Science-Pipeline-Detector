Introduction\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.\n\n### Challenge\n\n1. Explore the state of digital learning in 2020.\n2. How the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

The extension collects page load events of over 10K education technology products in our product library, including websites, apps, web apps, software programs, extensions, ebooks, hardwares, and services used in educational institutions. The engagement data have been aggregated at school district level, and each file represents data from one school district.\n* The `products_info.csv` file includes information about the characteristics of the top 372 products with most users in 2020.\n* The `districts_info.csv` file includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from NCES and FCC.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1 Import modules and setup directories","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\ndata_root = '../input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning'\nengagement_data_folder = os.path.join(data_root, 'engagement_data')\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T08:22:15.446427Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T08:22:15.446916Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.500151Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T08:22:15.446825Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.499364Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2 View data sample from `engagement_data` folder","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read and view first file from engagement_data folder\nengagement_sample = pd.read_csv(\n    os.path.join(engagement_data_folder, os.listdir(engagement_data_folder)[0])\n)\nengagement_sample.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.501435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.501805Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.6652Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.501777Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T08:22:16.664079Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Columns description:**\n\n| Name | Description |\n| :--- | :----------- |\n| time | date in \"YYYY-MM-DD\" |\n| lp_id | The unique identifier of the product |\n| pct_access | Percentage of students in the district have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day |\n| engagement_index | Total page-load events per one thousand students of a given product and on a given day |\n\n<font color='green'>**Note:**</font> The engagement data are aggregated at school district level, and each file in the folder `engagement_data` represents data from one school district.

Conclusion\n\n### Districts\nI tried to identify top outliers (districts) in my study as a first step. These top 10 districts are located in the following states in descending order by mean enagement index:\n\n1. New York (City) - district 9536\n2. District of Columbia (City) - district 6418\n3. Arizona (City) - district 9007\n4. Illinois (Suburb) - district 8815\n5. New York (Rural) - district 9515\n6. Utah (Suburb) - district 3692\n\nBut if we combine data by mean engagement index in each state including city and rural (all districts) we'll have the following top 10 results:\n\n1. Arizona - 1 district\n2. New York - 8 districts\n3. New Hampshire - 2 districts\n4. District Of Columbia - 3 districts\n5. Connecticut - 30 districts\n6. New Jersey - 2 districts\n7. Indiana - 7 districts\n8. Illinois - 18 districts\n9. Massachusetts - 21 districts\n10. Utah - 29 districts\n\nThere is some intersection of states within both lists. It can be considered as strong evidence that the listed states have very good engagement index in comparison with other states. No correlation was found between engagement index and such districts data as:\n\n* pct_black/hispanic\n* pct_free/reduced\n* county_connections_ratio\n* pp_total_raw\n\n### Trends and patterns\nAll districts had similar pattern of engagement index in 2020. Engagement index dropped in summer with the smallest minimum in July. There are 66 products with positive trend, 256 with negative trend. 47 products have missing values (mostly) in the begining of the year which makes impossible to calculate trend.\n\n### Products\n\nIt is obvious to outline 3 most popular products:\n* Google Docs - which was probably driven by the need of creating and exchanging documents and information.\n* Google Classroom - which was probably driven by the need of LMS, online classes and digital learning.\n* YouTube - which was probably driven by the need of educational videos.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.
