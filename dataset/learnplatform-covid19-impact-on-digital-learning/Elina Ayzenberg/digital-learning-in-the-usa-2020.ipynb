students of all ages, not speaking about corporate users' products;\n- products designed for all students experienced less fluctuation in engagement in comparison with other categories;\n- we can notice a more or less **sharp decrease in the weekly engagement index on the 12th week, the next week after WHO declared COVID-19 a Pandemic and President Trump declared COVID-19 a National

To get a better understanding of the states from the districts dataset, I decided to create visualization with the following information per state:\n\n1. choropleth (colored map according to certain statistical metric) based on average engagement rate per day in each state;\n2. political orientation of the state based on presidential elections 2020 - I truly believe that political views of the majority in the state and educational issues are closely related;\n3. average annual salary of school teachers - not only per-pupil funding matters in education, but also per-teacher funding;\n4. number of universities and ratio 'citizens per 1 university' in the state - to my mind, higher education institutions are like centers of gravity in cities and towns. They play a significant role in the cultural life of citizens and can set cultural trends especially among young people.\n\nUsing this map, you can see how different the states are and, what is more important for analysis on the country level, how many blank spaces are on this map. Almost half of the states are neglected which makes results unreliable and the whole analysis quite limited.\n\nNevertheless, there might be interesting correlations between level of engagement and the features I chose to display.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def correct_add_data(df):\n    # correct 'District of Columbia' to upper case\n    df['state'] = df['state'].replace({'District of Columbia':'District Of Columbia'})\n    \n    # drop white spaces before and after names of the states\n    df['state'] =[\"\".join(string.rstrip().lstrip()) for string in df['state']]\n    \n    return df    \n    ","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T18:00:05.234722Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T18:00:05.234973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T18:00:05.245363Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T18:00:05.234944Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T18:00:05.244469Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# elections\nelections = pd.read_csv(r'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElinaAizenberg/Kaggle-competition/main/Popular%20vote%20backend%20-%20Sheet1.csv',\n                       usecols = [0,1], skiprows = [0,1,2,3], header = 0, names = ['state', 'called'])\n\n# drop sub-states like 'Maine 2nd District'\nelections = elections.drop(index = [4, 7, 15, 32, 39, 40])\n\nelections = correct_add_data(elections)\n\n# replace D with Democrats and R with Republicans\nelections['called'] = ['Democrats' if x == 'D' else 'Republicans' for x in elections['called']]\n\n# covid_cases\ncovid_cases = pd.read_csv(r'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElinaAizenberg/Kaggle-competition/main/United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv',\n                         usecols = [0,1, 5], names = ['submission_date', 'state_abb', 'new_case'], header = 0)\n\n#replace NYC with NY\ncovid_cases = covid_cases.replace({\"state_abb\": {'NYC':'NY'}})\n\n# abbreviation of states\nstate_abb = pd.read_csv(r'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElinaAizenberg/Vision-Zero-in-USA---project/main/data/name-abbr.csv',\n                       header = None, names = ['state', 'state_abb'])\n\n# merge covid_cases with states abbreviations\ncovid_cases = covid_cases.merge(state_abb, how = 'left', on = 'state_abb')\n\n# drop rows: Republic of Marshall Islands, GU -

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Personal view\n\nOrganizers offered several questions to answer using the data they provided. The most vague question that cannot be answered with this analysis is **how might online and distance learning evolve in the future?** \n\nI want to disclose my personal opinion on this problem that I formed in discussions with secondary school teachers and university professors in Moscow.\n\nOnline learning will definitely develop in the near future and even though after the pandemic the level of skepsis towards digital learning products increases, it will not stop the process of transferring from offline to online education.\noffline education has its own limits that cannot be overcome and that are successfully beaten by online education:\n- cost of education (primarily for higher education);\n- strict discipline rules that young students and their parents may not approve;\n- state defined educational programs.\n\nOnline education offers a candy in the form of a more free timetable, ability to study from any corner of the Earth, lower prices for higher education degrees and more freedom in choosing the syllabus. What is more, nowadays there is a widespread opinion that children should not learn handwriting, history or basic math because everything can be found in Google, calculated on a laptop and they will not write by hand at all. And this tendency has no geographical borders. A lesson with a laptop seems better than a lesson with a textbook and whiteboard. To my mind, the lower the level of education in society, the more this society will support online education. \n\nThis will lead to a bigger education gap: offline education for the rich, online education for the poor. I see that during  the pandemic the opposite view emerged: poorer and more vulnerable with limited access to digital products, bad Internet connection suffer more from distance education. But this situation is temporary: Internet connection will be more and more accessible for everybody, while real schools with educated teachers which are expensive to maintain will shorten in amount.\nUniversities and schools where teachers/professors will continue to communicate with students face to face and teach them to research, defend their views and develop critical thinking will become a privilege with a highly competitive entrance examination.\n\nI hope my predictions and personal view do not seem too pessimistic because there is also a bright side. Even though I assume that the quality of online education is significantly lower in comparison with offline learning, its broad application might offer great opportunities in those countries and regions where there are no or very limited alternatives.
