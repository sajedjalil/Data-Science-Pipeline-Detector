**Handling missing values for each dataframe**\nWhether we like it or not, real world data is messy. Data cleaning is a major part of every data science project and every dataset can possibly have missing values for multiple columns corresponding to a data entry. Before starting to analyse the data and draw conclusions, it is necessary to understand the presence of missing values in our dataset.\n\nWe notice values like **NaN** are present in several columns of our dataset. This represent the missing values. We have used **isnull().sum()** to summarize total number of missing values per column. \n\nNow we need to decide how do we wish to handle them $!$\n\n* **Remove rows with missing values:** The most elementary strategy is to remove all rows that contain missing values or, in extreme cases, entire columns that contain missing values.\n* **Imputing Missing Values in our Dataset:** Removing rows is a good option when missing values are small. But this is not always practical. We need to replace these NaNs with intelligent guesses.\nThere are many options to pick from when replacing a missing value:\n> * Replacing NaNs with a single constant value .\n> * Replacing NaNs with the value from the previous row or the next row (using ffill or bfill method).\n> * Replacing NaNs using Mean/Median/Mode of the column.\n> * Using the replace method.\n\nThe details of the missing

Conclusion\n* Engagement Index has a positive correlation with avg_pp_total_raw (total expenditure per pupil). Make sense if the expenditure is aimed at increasing digital learning we expect the engagement to increase with expenditure.\n* There is a strong negative correlation between engagement index and avg_pct_free/reduced i.e. as more people qualify for free/reduced lunch in a school district the average index drops. Free/reduced lunch qualification depends on poor economic status. So this might be due to poor people can't afford the infrastructure required for engagement in digital learning \n\n* avg students that indentify as black/hispanic increases as the number of people qualifying for free lunch increases. This is probably due to black and hispanic communities being financial poor compared to other communities in USA. \n\n* We can also conclude that black/hispanic communities also have lower engagement

This is where the digital/online learning played a vital role.\n> * The engagement index had improved over the course of 2020, fall engagement index was higher than spring. This well understood because schools,institutions and even corporates started using online platforms for learning and working from home.\n> * The data clearly shows the sharp drop in engagement index durring summer holidays as expected\n\n> * There is more engagment at the begining of the week then it slowly drops as it gets to the weekend.
