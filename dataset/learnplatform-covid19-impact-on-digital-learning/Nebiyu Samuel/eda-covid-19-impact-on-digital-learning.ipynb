For better understanding, weekends are removed from this visualization as students will not attend classes on weekends and this would add a disturbing visual effect and make the plot more difficult to understand. Let's summarize what we see:\n\n### * the home schooling phase starts at the beginning of March\n### * there is a bell-shape between March and July\n### * during July and August there are summer holidays and therefore no classes to attend\n### * after the summer holidays the pct_access increases to a higher level as observed at the beginning of the pandemic and it stays somewhat constant\n### * there are a few drops in pct_access visible throughout the year - these might be national holidays or other holidays\n### * Zoom and Meet seem to be the two most popular products for virtual classrooms\n### Over the last quarter of 2020, we can see a pct_access of roughly 15. What does this mean? 15 % of students in the district have at least one page-load event of Zoom or Meet. To be honest, that seems a little bit low from the home schooling point of view given that every student needs to attend classes on a school day. However, this seems to hint at the fact that not all students had to attend classes virtually but were able to physically go to school. Judging from this State-by-State Map of Where School Buildings Are Opened or Closed it seems like a lot of schools offered in-person education in 2020. That means, when looking at digital learning, we should probably focus our analysis on districts where digital learning was actually applied to get some key insights.\n\n### While for pct_access Zoom and Meet seem to have roughly similiar values, we can see in the lower graph that Meet has more than 4 times the value of Zoom for engagement_index in the last quarter of 2020. What does this mean? If we have 1000 page-load events per 1000 students for Zoom on a given day that means that one student uses Zoom once a day. In contrast, Meet is used 4 or 5 times daily on average per student.\n\n### To make things a little bit clearer: If every students has two applications on their phone, the pct_access indicates how many of the students access this app on a daily basis but the engagement_index tells you how much the students engag","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"virtual_classroom_lp_id = products_info[products_info.primary_function_sub == 'Virtual Classroom']['LP ID'].unique()\n\n# Remove weekends from the dataframe\nengagement['weekday'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(engagement['time']).weekday\nengagement_without_weekends = engagement[engagement.weekday < 5]\n\n# Figure 1\nf, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(24, 6))\nfor virtual_classroom_product in virtual_classroom_lp_id:\n    temp = engagement_without_weekends[engagement_without_weekends.lp_id == virtual_classroom_product].groupby('time').pct_access.mean().to_frame().reset_index(drop=False)\n    sns.lineplot(x=temp.time, y=temp.pct_access, label=products_info[products_info['LP ID'] == virtual_classroom_product]['Product Name'].values[0])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n# Figure 2\nf, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(24, 6))\nfor virtual_classroom_product in virtual_classroom_lp_id:\n    temp = engagement_without_weekends[engagement_without_weekends.lp_id == virtual_classroom_product].groupby('time').engagement_index.mean().to_frame().reset_index(drop=False)\n    sns.lineplot(x=temp.time, y=temp.engagement_index, label=products_info[products_info['LP ID'] == virtual_classroom_product]['Product Name'].values[0])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-31T16:37:28.471258Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-31T16:37:28.471555Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-31T16:37:32.388244Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-31T16:37:28.471526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-31T16:37:32.387141Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Below we can see the top 5 most accessed products for each LC sub-category sorted by the mean pct_access for 2020 over all districts.

Based on this approach, we should be able to see which subfunction category that gained the most engagement over the course of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n### As you can see in the below left figure, the data reflects our assumption that products of the subfunction 'Virtual Classroom' gained the most change in pct_access. At second place, we have Learning Management Systems (LMS). These top two categories are also the top two categories from the engagement_index point of view.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"engagement['quarter'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(engagement['time']).quarter.astype(str)\n\ntemp = engagement.merge(products_info[['lp_id', 'Product Name', 'primary_function_main', 'primary_function_sub']], on='lp_id')\ntemp = temp[temp.primary_function_sub.notna()]\ntemp = temp.groupby(['quarter', 'primary_function_sub'])['pct_access', 'engagement_index'].mean().reset_index(drop=False)\n\ntemp = temp.pivot(index='primary_function_sub', columns='quarter')[['pct_access', 'engagement_index']].fillna(0)\n\ntemp.columns = [\"_\".join(a) for a in temp.columns.to_flat_index()]\n\ntemp['pct_access_delta'] = temp['pct_access_4'] - temp['pct_access_1']\ntemp['engagement_index_delta'] = temp['engagement_index_4'] - temp['engagement_index_1']\ntemp=temp.reset_index(drop=False)\n#temp = temp.merge(products_info[['lp_id', 'Product Name', 'primary_function_sub']], on='lp_id')\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(20, 10))\n\ndf = temp.sort_values(by='pct_access_delta', ascending=False)#.head(5)\n\nsns.barplot(data=df, x='pct_access_delta', y='primary_function_sub', palette='GnBu', ax=ax[0])\n\ndf = temp.sort_values(by='engagement_index_delta', ascending=False)#.head(5)\n\nsns.barplot(data=df, x='engagement_index_delta', y='primary_function_sub', palette='GnBu', ax=ax[1])\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-31T16:37:36.135654Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-31T16:37:36.136023Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-31T16:38:04.740281Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-31T16:37:36.135988Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-31T16:38:04.738922Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Review of the Problem Statement\n### Next, review the problem statement and brainstorm some ideas for questions you would like to answer with your analysis. For this, you could try something like a mindmap as follows.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n### The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow. Challenge\n\n### We challenge the Kaggle community to explore (1) the state of digital learning in 2020 and (2) how the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.\n\n### We encourage you to guide the analysis with questions that are related to the themes that are described above (in bold font). Below are some examples of questions that relate to our problem statement:\n\n### What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n### What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n### How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?\n### How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n### Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?\n### Based on the above problem statement from the challenge's description, you could start with a mindmap as shown below. learnplatform.005.jpeg\n\n### From here you should continue your brainstorming and extend the above mindmap with further items.","metadata":{}}]}
