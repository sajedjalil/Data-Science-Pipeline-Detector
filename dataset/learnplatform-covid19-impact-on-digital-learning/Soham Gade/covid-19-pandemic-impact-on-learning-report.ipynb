This is deduced from the usage of the products through engagement.<br> As the schools entered the academic year 20-21, the format seems more steady for learning in an online enviornment. The products that primarily focus on <b>school and district operations (SDO)</b> generally see a high engagement which is then followed by products that come under learning and curriculum.<br>In this category the most actively used product is <b>Google Docs</b> (LC - Content & Creation). It is also observed that by the end of the academic year 20-21 most of the products under company Google see a rise in the engagement.

This data comprises of over 200 school districts presented with a unique indentifier (number).<br>It contains:</p></ul>\n    <ul><ul><li><b>state</b> --- The state where the district resides</li>\n        <li><b>locale</b> --- U.S. territory categorisation into four types of areas: City, Suburban (denoted as Suburb), Town, and Rural.</li>\n        <li><b>pct_black/hispanic</b> --- Percentage of students in the districts identified as Black or Hispanic</li>\n        <li><b>pct_free/reduced</b> --- Percentage of students in the districts eligible for free or reduced-price lunch</li>\n        <li><b>county_connections_ratio</b> --- Ratio of residential fixed high-speed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction/households</li>\n        <li><b>pp_total_raw</b> --- Per-pupil total expenditure (sum of local and federal expenditure)</li></ul></ul>\n    <div class=\"h2\">Data Processing</div>\n <p class=\"para\">Most of these data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under, for data generalization purposes. Along with this there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset. Thus, before we move forward with our data we will have to process it first and see if any of the missing values can be filled where only one or two data points are missing.<br> <b>Note: </b>While deleting the null values from the district dataset <i>only the rows where the State names are not present have been removed</i>. While the other rows may consist null values in some of the columns, the data available in other columns is crucial hence they have been kept.</p>\n <ul><div class=\"h3\">Ranged Values</div></ul>\n    <ul><p class=\"para\">Most of the data points in our district dataset (such as percent values, ratio values & total expenditure values) have been presented in a range (also known as the <a href=\"https://www.mathwords.com/i/interval_notation.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Interval Notation</a>)<br>Such that, the data is represented in two open paranthesis <b>[</b><i>value1</i>, <i>value2</i><b>[</b> , where value1 is the starting range (<b>inclusive</b>) and value2 is the ending range (<b>exclusive</b>). For example,\n    <ul><p class=\"para\"><b>[2, 10[</b>  --- in this range the values will fall between  \"<b>>=2  & &lt10</b>\"</p></ul>\n    <p class=\"para\">The plots will be shown in the same format as the interval notation since the end range limit is <b>exclusive</b> of the range</p>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"h4\">Legends</div>\n<p class=\"para\">In the following graphs wherever there are legends, you can peform multiple actions on that plot using the legend.<br>In the plot there are two basic actions with regards to legend entities.\n    <ul><li>When you click/tap on a single entity, it is removed from the plot.

These benefits can be used from this card like a debit card to buy food in most grocery stores and farmer markets or to buy food online at Amazon or Walmart.

This eligibility is determined by a disability that adversly affects academic performance.<br>In 2019-2020, number of students ages 3-21 who received special education services under the IDEA was 7.3 million or 14 percent of all public school students. Among the students receiving special education services, the most common category of disability (33 percent) was specific learning disabilities.<br><b>The following image has been taken from <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cgg\" target=\"_blank\">NCES COE - Students with Disabilities</a></b>, which gives the statistics of these students how they were attend most of their classes, that is the enviornment.</p><img src=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/figures/CGG/Figure_1_CGG-flat.svg\"></img></ul>\n    <ul><ul><div class=\"h3\">Fundings</div>\n    <li><b>Part B:</b> Part B of IDEA provides funds to the states to assist them in providing <b>FAPE</b>(free appropriate public education) to children ages 3-12 with disabilities who are in need of special education and related services.</li>\n    <li><b>Part C:</b> Part C of IDEA provides funds to the states to assit them in developing and implementing state wide, comprehensive, co-ordinated, multidisciplinary, intragency systems to make early intervention  services available to all children from birth through age two with disabilities and their families.</li></ul><br>\n    <div class=\"h4\">Difficulties</div>\n    <p class=\"para\">The assumption underlying the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its\npredecessor legislation is that, on average, the cost\nof educating children with disabilities is twice the\naverage cost (measured as the national average per\npupil expenditure or APPE) of educating other\nchildren. Congress determined that the federal\ngovernment would pay up to 40 percent of this\n\"excess\" cost, which is referred to as full funding.\nSince 1981, the first year for which full funding\nwas 40 percent of APPE, the federal share has\nremained less than half of the federal commitment\nbased on regular appropriations. Each year the\nfederal government fails to fully fund IDEA, it\nshifts the costs for educating students with special\nneeds to states and school districts. <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/IDEA%20Funding%20Gap%20by%20State%20FY%202020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a><br></p>\n    <p class=\"statement\">Hence to implement an infrastructure as desired for the students with disabilities, the federal government fundings if payed as promised will make a huge difference.</p>        ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"h1\">Sources</div>\n<div class=\"h3\">Extra Datasets</div>\n<ul><li>Households with facilities, availability for K-12 school students:</li>\n    <ul><li><a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/11140-households-in-which-internet-is-usually-or-always-available-to-children-for-educational-purposes?loc=1&loct=2#detailed/2/2-52/false/2080,2079,2078,2077,2076,2047,2042,2034,2033,2032/any/21503\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Only Internet</b></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/11142-households-in-which-a-computer-to-digital-device-is-usually-or-always-available-to-children-for-educational-purposes?loc=1&loct=2#detailed/2/2-52/false/2080,2079,2078,2077,2076,2047,2042,2034,2033,2032/any/21505\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Only Devices</b></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/11144-households-in-which-internet-and-a-computer-to-digital-device-are-usually-or-always-available-to-children-for-educational-purposes?loc=1&loct=2#detailed/2/2-52/false/2080,2079,2078,2077,2076,2047,2042,2034,2033,2032/any/21507\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Both Internet & Devices</b></a></li></ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Personal Comsumption Expenditure</b></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/119446/version/V130/view\" target=\"_blank\"><b>COVID-19 US State Policy database</b></a> This dataset link was provided by <b>LearnPlatform</b></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/economics-analytics/industry-analysis-division/urban-rate-survey-data-resources\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Monthly Urban Internet Charges</b></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-districts-reopening-plans-a-snapshot/2020/07\" target=\"_blank\"><b>K-12 Schools Reopeoning Plans</b></a> (States & School Districts)</li></ul><br>\n    \n<div class=\"h1\">Acknowledgement</div><br>\n<p class=\"para\">I would like to give many thanks to <b>Learnplatform</b> for giving an opportunity to work on this project.
