In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool ARX (Prasser et al. 2020) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For data generalization purposes some data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset.\n\n#### district_id - The unique identifier of the school district\n\n\n#### state\t- The state where the district resides in\n\n\n#### locale - NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural. See Locale Boundaries User's Manual for more information.\n\n#### pct_black/hispanic\t - Percentage of students in the districts identified as Black or Hispanic based on 2018-19 NCES data\n\n#### pct_free/reduced\t- Percentage of students in the districts eligible for free or reduced-price lunch based on 2018-19 NCES data\n\n#### county_connections_ratio - ratio (residential fixed high-speed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction/households) based on the county level data from FCC From 477 (December 2018 version). See FCC data for more information.\n\n#### pp_total_raw - Per-pupil total expenditure (sum of local and federal expenditure) from Edunomics Lab's National Education Resource Database on Schools (NERD) project.

Challenge\n\nWe challenge the Kaggle community to explore \n\n(1) the `state of digital learning` in 2020 and \n\n(2) how the `engagement of digital learning` relates to `factors` such as `district demographics`, `broadband access`, and `state/national level policies and events`.\n\nWe encourage you to guide the analysis with questions that are related to the themes that are described above (in bold font). Below are some examples of questions that relate to our problem statement:\n\nWhat is the `picture of digital connectivity and engagement` in 2020?\n\nWhat is the `effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning`, and how might this also `evolve` in the future?\n\nHow does `student engagement with different types of education technology` change over the course of the pandemic?\n\nHow does `student engagement with online learning platforms` relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n\nDo certain `state interventions, practices or policies` (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"products_engagement_data = pd.merge(products_df, districts_engagement_data, left_on='lp_id',
