But not every student has equal opportunities to learn. Effective policies and plans need to be enacted in order to make education more equitable—and perhaps your innovative data analysis will help reveal the solution.\n\nCurrent research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There's an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.\n\nEducation technology company LearnPlatform was founded in 2014 with a mission to expand equitable access to education technology for all students and teachers. LearnPlatform’s comprehensive edtech effectiveness system is used by districts and states to continuously improve the safety, equity, and effectiveness of their educational technology. LearnPlatform does so by generating an evidence basis for what’s working and enacting it to benefit students, teachers, and budgets.\n\nThis analytics competition expects to uncover trends in digital learning. Accomplish this with data analysis about how engagement with digital learning relates to factors like district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.\n\nThe submissions will inform policies and practices that close the digital divide. With a better understanding of digital learning trends, you may help reverse the long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable, making education more equitable.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"2\"></a>\n# 2 Preparations\nWe are preparing packages and source data that will be used in the analysis process.

There is an increased in the daily mean of `accessed products` after the `summer holiday`. Are the students in every school districts using a more diversify products or there are new products to support digital learning?\n- In every month there are volatility in the trend, that follow an order of `5-2` which are `5 days of school` and `2 days of weekend`.\n- Though the number of `accessed products` decreased in the weekend but we still see `accessed products` in the weekend, number of `accessed products` in the weekend are about `25%-50%` from the weekday. Does it mean there are still many students that studying in the weekend?\n- In the mid-February, there is an temporary school closures followed by WHO that characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11th 2020. We can see there is an increased on `accessed products` starting from mid-February, though the increased are marginal.\n- `Summer holiday` in the United States are differ between schools districts, usually start in `late May / early June` and end in `late August / early September`, this consistent with lower `accessed products` on those dates but it can be considered high compared to regular date. Once again, does it mean there are many students that still study in the holiday?

In this analysis we are aggregating all daily page-load in 2020 for a given `State`, `Locale` and `School District` while `School District` will also be grouped on `State` level. There are`233` district in `23` states with `4` locale excluding `Unknown`. \n\n**Observations:**\n- **State**\n    - `Page-load` that doesn't have their corresponding `state` are big which is reaching `594 million` which is in the first position and can not be easily ignored. In the analysis, we called it `Unknown`.\n    - There are `3 states` that have more than `300 million` of `page-load` in 2020, they are `Connecticut`, `Illinois` and `Massachusetts`. They are contributing around `40.7%` of total `page-load` in 2020, if we include `Unknown` state, the contribution increased to `61.7%`.\n- **Locale**\n    - There are `2.8 billion` page-load in 2020, most of it is coming from `Suburb` area that contributes `48%` of total observations.\n    - `Unknown` is the second highest contribution in the `page-load` which is around `594 million` with a contribution of 20.9%.\n    - `City` and `Town` are the lowest locale with `308 million` and `99 million` page-load.\n- **District**\n    - Higher `page-load` in a state doesn't always mean a good things, especially if the state is supported by many school districts. A good indication is to see the mean `page-load` from each school districts in a state. There is only one state that passed `20 million` page-load in 2020 that is `Illinois`. \n    - Though `Unknown` has the highest `page-load`, it only has a mean of around `10 million`, this indicate

A combination of `20%-40%` reduced price and `8,000-10,000`","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 600\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 1), facecolor='#f6f5f5')\ngs = fig.add_gridspec(1, 2)\ngs.update(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.8)\n\n##########Page Load##########\ntemp = pd.DataFrame(combine.groupby(['pct_free/reduced'], dropna=False)['engagement_index'].sum()).reset_index()\ntemp.columns = ['description', 'amount']\ntemp = temp.fillna('Unknown')\ntemp = temp.sort_values('amount', ascending=False)\n\nbackground_color = \"#f6f5f5\"\ncolor_map = [\"dimgray\" for _ in range(6)]\ncolor_map[0] = \"#ffd514\"\nsns.set_palette(sns.color_palette(color_map))\n\nax0 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])\nax0.set_facecolor(background_color)\nfor s in [\"right\", \"top\"]:\n    ax0.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n\n#graph\nax0 = sns.barplot(x=temp['description'],y=temp['amount']/1000000, zorder=3, saturation=1)\nax0.grid(which='major', axis='x', zorder=0, color='#EEEEEE', linewidth=0.2)\nax0.grid(which='major', axis='y', zorder=0, color='#EEEEEE', linewidth=0.2)\n\n#format axis\nax0.set_xlabel(\"Free or Reduced Price\",fontsize=3, weight='bold')\nax0.set_ylabel(\"school districts\",fontsize=3, weight='bold')\nax0.tick_params(labelsize=3, width=0.5, length=1.5)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\ny_format = ticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, p: format(int(x), ','))\nax0.yaxis.set_major_formatter(y_format)\n\n#title\nx0, x1 = ax0.get_xlim()\ny0, y1 = ax0.get_ylim()\nax0.text(x0, y1+140, 'Free or Reduced Price & Page Load', fontsize=4, ha='left', va='top', weight='bold')\nax0.text(x0, y1+60, 'Unknown has the highest page-load', fontsize=3, ha='left', va='top')\n\n####################\ntemp = pd.DataFrame(pd.pivot_table(combine, index=['pct_free/reduced', 'pp_total_raw'], values='engagement_index', aggfunc='sum', dropna=False)).reset_index()\ntemp = pd.pivot_table(temp, index=['pct_free/reduced'], columns='pp_total_raw', values='engagement_index', aggfunc='sum', dropna=False)/1000000000\n\nbackground_color = \"#f6f5f5\"\ncolors = [\"black\", \"#ffd514\"]\ncolormap = matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list(\"\", colors)\n\nax0 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 1])\nax0.set_facecolor(background_color)\n\n#graph\nax0_sns = sns.heatmap(temp, ax=ax0, annot=True, square=True, xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True,\n            annot_kws={\"size\": 2.5}, cbar=False, cmap=colormap, linewidths=0.3, \n            linecolor=background_color, fmt='.1g')\n\n#title\nx0, x1 = ax0.get_xlim()\ny0, y1 = ax0.get_ylim()\nax0.text(x0, y1-0.8, \"Reduced Price & Per-pupil Total Expenditure\", fontsize=4, ha='left', va='top', weight='bold')\nax0.text(x0, y1-0.4, 'Relation in terms of billion page-load', fontsize=3, ha='left', va='top')\n\n#axis\nax0_sns.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax0_sns.set_ylabel(\"\")\nax0_sns.tick_params(length=0, labelsize=3)\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T15:01:45.673496Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T15:01:45.673835Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T15:01:51.289242Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T15:01:45.673803Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T15:01:51.288242Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"ref\"></a>\n# References\n\n- https://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19\n- https://www.edweek.org/leadership/the-coronavirus-spring-the-historic-closing-of-u-s-schools-a-timeline/2020/07","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
