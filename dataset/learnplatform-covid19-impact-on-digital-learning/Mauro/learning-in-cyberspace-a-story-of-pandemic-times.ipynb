Introduction</b></div>\nAlmost two years have passed since the first positive case of Covid-19 was reported. Since then, our overall approach to the learning process moved towards the digital world, a shift that was eased by the outstanding digital technologies we today have in our hands. The engagement of students on learning digital products has intuitively increased with the <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">advent of distance learning</span>, a countermeasure to defend populations against the spread of Coronavirus. The question that naturally arises is the following: By how much? How strong is the thrust of the pandemic towards keeping distances in a digital fashion when it comes to learning? Several other questions more or less related to these thematic areas can and must be answered if we want to deeply understand the impact of COVID-19 on our learning paths, and this is what we are going to address. The US is composed by a wide variety of individuals with different cultures, origins, and situations (regarding social, economic, and health positions), and such a variety includes people from all ages thus being incorporated in the whole American learning machine. Addressing these thematic areas will highlight a <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">clear picture</span> of Education and the effects of COVID-19 on it, and hopefully help to draw <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">more effective policies</span> to reduce the gaps, exacerbated by the pandemic itself, among all the learning individuals in the United States (and not only).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"background-color:cyan\"><b>2. Statement of Purpose</b></div>\n\nOur aim is to carry out a concise analysis of Digital Learning and, more precisely, Digital Learning after the explosion of COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., from 2020 onwards. The products related to digital learning are not treated uniformly in the US territory, but there are several differences on the engagement of students (and, more generally, of learners) towards such digital learning products. Differences in engagement are likely to be driven some other kind of differences that we did not know about so far, at least not with a consistent degree of confidence, since this is a completely new situation. After all, it is the first pandemic the humanity faces since the advent of the Digital Age. Such ‘other kind of differences’ are the factors we are going to investigate and point out. To do so, we will follow an approach based on several questions that are closely related to our main aim, questions whose answers will give us crucial insights to truly understand digital learning and the related challenges.\nThe main points that will be developed one by one in the analysis are the following:\n-\tWhat is the <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">picture</span> of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n-\tWhat is the <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">effect</span> of the COVID-19 pandemic <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">on online and distance learning</span>, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n-\tHow does student engagement with <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">different types of education technology</span> change over the course of the pandemic?\n-\tHow does student engagement with online learning technologies relate to <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">different location-specific characteristics</span>?\n-\tDo certain <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">state interventions, practices or policies</span> correlate with the increase or decrease of online

Each week, the level of digital engagement is high in the first 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), then it slightly decreases on Friday, up to a much lower value (usually the minimum) on Saturday and on Sunday. This behavior clearly shows that the level of attention towards digital and online product engagement is proportional to the amount of work and/or study imposed on that specific time. In fact, the great majority of school weeks' end on Friday, between 12.00 p.m. and 14.00 p.m., and it is unlikely to be just a coincidence that the last school day of the week is coupled with lower online engagement. \n- The engagement level <b>drastically drops when getting closer to the summer season</b>. It starts decreasing from the end of April, and only starts rising again in August. Remember: in the U.S. the school year usually starts from August, and that is probably the reason of such a behavior. Engagement stands far below the weekend level during the year, even during the week, and it decreases further during weekends (the difference between middle-week and week-end is extremely smaller compared to that observed during the school year).\n- The level of <b>engagement was overall lower at the beginning of 2020</b>, when Covid-19 was not considered a threat yet. Moreover, the overall level of engagement was even higher in the second half of 2020, with the beginning of 2020-2021 school year, compared to the one observed between February and May. These are clear signals that Covid-19 has some role in altering digital engagement trends, and we will explore this further. \n- There is a clear <b>mismatch between Engagement Index and Pct Access before the advent of Covid-19</b>; in this period, Pct Access levels were much higher compared to digital engagement ones, differently from the rest of 2020 where the two measures are almost perfectly correlated.\n- Thanksgiving day (and the closest following days) exhibits a sudden decrease in digital engagement similar to the fall induced by the weekends, regardless of the fact that the 25th of November 2020 was Wednesday. It is thus likely that <b>important holidays lead to</b> more or less sharp <b>decreases in student engagement</b> caused by the fact that students tend to spend more time with family members and/or friends and less engaging digital learning technologies.\n- The days representing the so-called Christmas Holidays display, similarly to what we just saw with Thanksgiving, a consistently lower level of digital engagement; the reason is likely to be the same as for Thanksgiving, and also considering the explanation behind low engagement during summer: Christmas Holidays, as the Summer ones, imply <b>school breaks</b> that <b>inevitably lead students to be less engaged towards learning technologies</b>, regardless of whether they are digital or not.\n\nNow, it is worth remarking that the digital engagement index is not always made up by the same components; they may vary throughout the pandemic, with some digital products being engaged more and some less at certain points in 2020.

The relationship between these two metrics and Engagement Index, anyway, is rather ambiguous and difficult to interpret; for the first months in which Covid-19 appeared (more than half of 2020), there were two main problems with the recording of Coronavirus cases and deaths and both related to the lack of experience and preparedness to handle such an unusual and unexpected situation:\n* Low number of tests, with a subsequent misleading number of registered cases: cases at the beginning of April are underestimated, but their true number is likely to be close to that of November or even December (which are more realistic thanks to the higher number of tests performed), considering the respective deaths\n* Little knowledge and/or preparedness on how to efficiently handle severe Coronavirus infections, leading to a higher lethality in the first months of pandemic\n\nAnyway, even with the forementioned discrepancies, it is possible to deduce a recurrent behavior of engagement index compared to Covid-19 cases: not only it rises in correspondence of epidemic peaks, rather it starts increasing <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\"><b>before</b></span> the actual increase in cases, and if at a first glance this might sound strange, it perfectly matches what we previously supposed: the major relationship between digital engagement and Covid-19 diffusion integrates the <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\"><b>threat of diffusion</b></span> of Covid-19 rather than being limited to Covid-19 diffusion itself. Online engagement rises as a response to the increase in threat posed by Covid-19, and by its already established spread outside the U.S.\nBefore peaks in Covid-19 cases in the U.S., there have already been peaks in several nations worldwide, and these peaks are likely to influence U.S. digital engagement more than the internal ones. Thus, for the 'threat' phase, this relationship makes perfectly sense; besides, the threat is exhacerbated by the cases of Covid-19 in the U.S. increasing unexpectedly fast, from 500 to 5000 in a single week, leading to a further boost in digital engagement. For what concerns the outbreak phase and the burst in digital engagement between August and September, it is the result of the new school year being starting, probably combined with the local peak in cases experienced in July and the almost constant number of infections of that period; in this case, in fact, the threat had come true, with a consistent number of cases <b>inside</b> the U.S. and which did not seem to be intended to go down. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, another crucial part: how might the digital learning context evolve in the future?\nOur data is focused on 2020, but we already lived more than 2/3 of 2021 and we know that the situation has changed further. In fact, in 2021 we entered in a sort of \"Coexistence\" phase, with the pandemic being more under control (at least in the U.S.) thanks to the advance of the vaccination campaign. We can presumably infer that the digital engagement situation was similar throughout the last months of 2020-2021 school year to what we saw in the previous chart, and probably being reduced in the last months due both to the end of the school year and to the vaccination campaign. But what happens next to the huge reliance on online and digital learning depends on several factors such as the advent of new Covid-19 variants, the long-term effectiveness of vaccines, and also the satisfaction of who was involved in the digital learning context the most.\n\nWe can distinguish among three possible scenarios in the future:\n* <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">Covid-19 <b>threat</b> is drastically reduced or disappears</span>: either because the vaccines work well on future variants as well, or because pharmaceutical companies reveal themselves to be able to adapt currently existing vaccines and new ones to any variant that overrides the standard serums; in this case, there are two sub scenarios:\n    * <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">Digital learning revealed effective</span>, able to keep up with face-to-face learning or even to enhance the learning process itself, online learners are satisfied. In this case, the changes brought by the perspective of digital learning to learning institutions (schools, universities, ...) will be <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">implemented permanently</span>, maybe with some sort of blended learning between face-to-face learning and online learning, or implementing the digital learning part in face-to-face sessions as well.\n    * <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">Digital learning reveal to be ineffective</span>, either becuase unequal among users (e.g. different social/demographic/economic context, etc.), difficult to sustain in the long run, it causes discrepancies in the learning process or simply leaves the parts involved unsatisfied; this is the scenario in which the future of digital engagement is less rosy, with <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">levels similar to the pre-covid ones</span>.\n* <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">Covid-19 poses some <b>threat</b></span> due to difficulties with vaccines on future variants. In this case, distancing countermeasures might be necessary, at least in the near future, to stem the risk of Covid-19 infection. This, in turn, would lead to <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">more reliance on digital learning</span>, with levels around the ones experienced in the Outbreak phase or even higher.\n\nAn article of the New York Times [2] about the future of schools after the end of the pandemic takes into account a sort of survey asking almost 400 students their own opinions about distance learning; The overall response highlights both positive and negative aspects:\n\n> ... They told us about all the things they miss about going to school: their friends, teachers, sports, extracurricular activities, even “the loud and crazy lunchroom.”\n\n> ... Some also recounted the challenges of distance learning, like struggling to understand assignments, getting easily distracted and not having reliable internet\n\n> ... Many students also said there were aspects of remote learning they enjoyed, such as getting to work at their own pace, setting their own schedule and being free from “the stressful environment of school.”\n\nIt is anyway not a novelty that distance learning comes with both challenges and positives. These citations highlight some of the challenges for Digital Learners; the challenge of Digital Instructors (and not only) stands in making the digital learning process as smooth as possible, given that the future scenario is one involving the consistent presence of digital learning (and high digital engagement of students, as a consequence). We will soon investigate this latter challenge deeper.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style='background-color:lime;width:60%;margin-left:20%;box-shadow: 3px 6px 6px gray'>\n<b>\n<font size='4'>\n    KEY INSIGHTS:\n</font>\n<font size='2'>\n    <ul>\n        <li> Three engagement development phases can be highlighted: Pre-threat, Threat, Outbreak</li>\n        <li> Digital engagement is higher in the second half of 2020, in the Outbreak phase</li>\n        <li> Mismatch between Covid19 cases/deaths and Digital Engagement levels</li>\n        <li> Apparent increase in Digital Engagement when the threat of Covid19 diffusion increases</li> \n        <li> Digital Learning technologies are likely to become part of everyday learning activities</li>\n    </ul>\n</font>\n</b>\n</div>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"background-color:cyan\"> <b>5.

The behavior of individual functionalities is far from being regular though; rather, some primary functions have seen highly varying engagement towards them throughout the various phases of 2020, and there is an explanation behind such a behavior.\n\nSeveral Learning & Curriculum -related functionalities had their maxima during the 'Threat' phase, some weeks before Covid-19 cases reached alarming levels but anyway in a period where the fear related to Covid-19 threat was high, and increasing. Such fear led to improvement in the digital learning tissue in the whole United States territory, including what concerns the specific functionalites under the Learning and Curriculum category. This incorporates Digital Learning Platforms, Courseware & Textbooks, various kinds of Study Tools and also the Sites, Resources & References (some of them) functionalities: all of them reached their highest levels within the end of March. \nAnyway, there are also functionalities that displayed much lower engagement levels throughout the first half of 2020, and then reached summits, in the latter half, rarely observed before. We are talking about Content Creation & Curation, Online Course Providers & Technical Skills Development and, the most peculiar, Streaming Services subcategory of Sites, Resources & References.\n\nSome further insights can be easily extracted from the chart:\n\n* The advent of some technologies and their becoming more engaged led some others to be disregarded, leading their engagement levels, in the last months of 2020, below the pre-pandemic levels (purple band)\n* The reduction in engagement for what concerns Digital Learning Platforms is likely to be caused by the preparedness developed by the U.S. system, moving from a lockdown of schools during/right after the Threat phase to a more blend-oriented learning. This reduced, at least partially, the need to rely on these platforms and increased the need to lean towards other more blend-oriented technologies.

The reason may be related to the low number of available school districts data for these states, especially Arizona which <b>comes with only a single district</b>, yielding distorted results: if a state is represented by a single district, there is a higher probability of the representation being biased; if that district represents an exception, the whole state might be misclassified as a high black/hispanic district. This is pretty much what happened before, and observing this plot we can conclude that the proportion of inhabitants of a state belonging to black/hispanic ethnicities is related, at least partially, to the levels of engagement towards digital learning technologies in that state. Indeed, almost all the states with & Black/Hispanic above the threshold display mean daily engagement index values much below 200, with only two exceptions and of which one is an underrepresented state coming with a single district!

From the top chart we can notice that the levels of digital engagement rose on February, for both district categories and in very similar proportions; then, engagement levels continued to increase for high-expenditure districts, while for low-expenditure districts they kept being more or less the same for all the first half of 2020, and increasing slightly in the Outbreak phase (from September to December). \n\nWhat can we deduce about it is that high-expenditure districts' students were always slightly more digital learning -oriented, but <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">Covid-19 emphasized </span> the (mainly economic) <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">differences</span> highlighted by per-pupil total expenditure, thus yielding districts that switched to digital learning more easily when the pandemic made it a necessity, and districts that faced more difficulties to keep up with such a need.\n\nWe focused on ethnic differences and economic ones; anyway, also territorial-context factors might be of interest for our purpose.

Each vertical line represents the four main Restrictive policies:\n* <span style=\"background-color:red\"><b>Emergency State</b> </span>\n* <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\"><b>School closure</b></span>\n* <span style=\"background-color:lime\"><b>Face Mask Obligation</b></span> and \n* <span style=\"background-color:orange\"><b>Stay Home Obligation</b></span>\n\nInterestingly, each policy among Emergency State, School Closure and Stay Home Obligation occurs in very similar contexts and has more or less the same consequences for every state. They are issued in periods close to each other, between the second half of February and the beginning of April, and they come with some discordant effects on digital engagement: for some cases, such as Indiana, Virginia and Michigan where digital engagement was already falling, it decreases also in correspondence of these policies; in other more common situations, like for example Wisconsin, Ohio, New York and Connecticut, digital engagement is boosted when these policies are issued. Then there are some more 'neutral' states, like Washington, California, D.C., where engagement levels are more or less unchanged even a couple of week after the policies have been issued, which is a reasonable time for such policies' effects to consolidate. The <span style=\"background-color:lightcyan\">overall relationship with Digital Engagement is positive</span>, considering also the magnitude of its boosts when they occur (see Arizona and Wisconsin versus Virginia and Missouri), but we already knew that since this is the phase we highlighted as 'Threat' phase, which displayed consistent increases of Digital Engagement levels. For 'overall positive relationship' we are not implying that they have some direct effect on it, only that the close periods following issuing of such policies are often charcterized by rising digital engagement. This may be interpreted in two ways:\n* Policies exert an indirect effect on digital engagement leading its levels to change as a result of their issue\n* They are issued in periods characterized by already ongoing trends (like increases of engagement at the beginning of the new school year), in which case the effect of policies may have no effect at all, or they may bring an opposite effect which is not strong enough to offset the initial trand, or rather they might being a contributing factor strengthening the trend \n\nFor this reason we should consider signals from changes in digital engagement levels after issued policies taking into account the context as a whole to draw more realistic conclusions: in case a policy is issued in all states during a single ongoing trend, its result can only be assessed considering all the factors at stake.\n\nWe also recall that Learning & Curriculum -related functionalities reached their 2020 maxima in the three weeks between 26th of February and 18th of March, and it is not a coincidence that, in the great majority of the states, <b>Emergency State and School Closed were issued within the 18th of March</b>. \n\nThe issuing of Face Mask Obligation is less standardized and occurs in various periods of 2020, depending on the State, and for this reason it is difficult to detect a common pattern behind its consequences. We can anyway notice that for most states Face Mask becomes mandatory during summer holidays, between its beginning (in which case digital engagement was already decreasing) and its end (where digital engagement rises due to the proximity of the new school year). It is easy to deduce that states felt necessary to impose such an obligation in periods of low digital engagement because several students were actually not digitally-engaging at all, but rather physically-engaging with each other and in summer activities, thus contributing to the birth of new outbreaks in the U.S. territory. For this reason, the face mask was made mandatory as a security measure against the risk of new infections during the summer period.\n\nWe now take under scrutiny the strictly 'Closing' policies, expecting them to be issued in similar periods as the first three Restriction policies we just analyzed and to carry analogous effects.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#grouped_by_date: by day; weekly: by week\nfig = px.line(weekly, x='time', y='engagement_index', facet_col=\"state\", facet_col_wrap=3, facet_col_spacing=0.05)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title={\n        'text': \"Mean Daily Engagement Index per Week - Closing Policies\",\n        'y':0.99,\n        'x':0.5,\n        'xanchor': 'center',\n        'yanchor': 'top'},    \n    template='plotly_dark',\n    height=1500,\n    margin=dict(\n        l=8,\n        r=16,\n    ))\nfig.update_yaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True, title_text='')\nfig.update_xaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True)\nfig.layout.xaxis16.title = {\n    'font':{\n            'color':'red'\n            },\n    'text':'- Restaurants Closed'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis17.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'blue'\n            },\n    'text':'- Gyms Closed'}\n    \nfig.layout.xaxis18.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'green'\n            },\n    'text':'- Cinemas Closed'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis13.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'orange'\n            },\n    'text':'- Bars Closed'}\n    \n\nfor k in range(len(fig.data)):\n    fig.data[k].line.color = 'cyan'\n\nfor k in range(18):\n    fig.layout.annotations[k].text = fig.layout.annotations[k].text[6:]\n    i = fig.data[k].xaxis\n    if len(i) > 1:\n        i = i[1:]\n    else:\n        i = 1\n    i = int(i)\n    \n    state = fig.data[k].hovertemplate.split('<br>')[0][6:]\n    if state == 'District Of Columbia':\n        state = 'District of Columbia'\n    row = int((i-1)/3) + 1\n    col = ((i-1) % 3) + 1\n\n    date = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['CLREST'].item()\n    if date is not np.nan:\n        enddate = pd.to_datetime(date) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='red', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date, x1=enddate, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"red\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n    \n    date2 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['CLGYM'].item()\n    if date2 is not np.nan:\n        enddate2 = pd.to_datetime(date2) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date2, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='blue', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date2, x1=enddate2, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"blue\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n\n    date3 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['CLMOVIE'].item()\n    if date3 is not np.nan:\n        enddate3 = pd.to_datetime(date3) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date3, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='green', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date3, x1=enddate3, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"green\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n  \n    date4 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['CLOSEBAR'].item()\n    if date4 is not np.nan:\n        enddate4 = pd.to_datetime(date4) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date4, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='orange', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date4, x1=enddate4, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"orange\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0) \n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T23:19:02.707306Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T23:19:02.707776Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T23:19:22.738978Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T23:19:02.707726Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T23:19:22.737731Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As anticipated: even if some policy issuing dates are missing for some states (or maybe they are never issued in such states), all of them were released in the great majority of the United States in the same weeks.

This makes sense since these specific policies consistently affect the behavior of students that are no longer able to practice sport or out-of-home recreational activities. \n\nNow, we can move on to category of policies from which we can expect the opposite effects on Digital Engagement: Reopening policies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#grouped_by_date: by day; weekly: by week\nfig = px.line(weekly, x='time', y='engagement_index', facet_col=\"state\", facet_col_wrap=3, facet_col_spacing=0.05)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title={\n        'text': \"Mean Daily Engagement Index per Week - Reopening Policies\",\n        'y':0.99,\n        'x':0.5,\n        'xanchor': 'center',\n        'yanchor': 'top'},    \n    template='plotly_dark',\n    height=1500,\n    margin=dict(\n        l=8,\n        r=16,\n    ))\nfig.update_yaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True, title_text='')\nfig.update_xaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True)\nfig.layout.xaxis16.title = {\n    'font':{\n            'color':'red'\n            },\n    'text':'- Restaurants Reopened'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis17.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'blue'\n            },\n    'text':'- Gyms Reopened'}\n    \nfig.layout.xaxis18.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'green'\n            },\n    'text':'- Cinemas Reopened'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis13.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'orange'\n            },\n    'text':'- Bars Reopened'}\n    \n\nfor k in range(len(fig.data)):\n    fig.data[k].line.color = 'cyan'\n\nfor k in range(18):\n    fig.layout.annotations[k].text = fig.layout.annotations[k].text[6:]\n    i = fig.data[k].xaxis\n    if len(i) > 1:\n        i = i[1:]\n    else:\n        i = 1\n    i = int(i)\n    \n    state = fig.data[k].hovertemplate.split('<br>')[0][6:]\n    if state == 'District Of Columbia':\n        state = 'District of Columbia'\n    row = int((i-1)/3) + 1\n    col = ((i-1) % 3) + 1\n\n    date = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['ENDREST'].item()\n    if date is not np.nan and '2021' not in date:\n        enddate = pd.to_datetime(date) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='red', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date, x1=enddate, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"red\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n    \n    date2 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['ENDGYM'].item()\n    if date2 is not np.nan and '2021' not in date2:\n        enddate2 = pd.to_datetime(date2) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date2, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='blue', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date2, x1=enddate2, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"blue\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n\n    date3 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['END_MOV'].item()\n    if date3 is not np.nan and '2021' not in date3:\n        enddate3 = pd.to_datetime(date3) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date3, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='green', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date3, x1=enddate3, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"green\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0)\n  \n    date4 = policies[policies['STATE']==state]['END_BRS'].item()\n    if date4 is not np.nan and '2021' not in date4:\n        enddate4 = pd.to_datetime(date4) + pd.DateOffset(days=14)\n        fig.add_vline(x=date4, line_dash=\"solid\", line_color='orange', line_width=2, row=row, col=col)\n        fig.add_vrect(x0=date4, x1=enddate4, row=row, col=col,\n                  fillcolor=\"orange\", opacity=0.4, line_width=0) \n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T23:20:23.418529Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T23:20:23.418951Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T23:20:39.422086Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T23:20:23.418918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T23:20:39.420752Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can clearly see that Reopening policies are issued in two situations:\n* <u>After or during</u> a <span style='background-color:lightcyan'>steady reduction of digital engagement</span>, caused by the end of the school year\n* <u>During</u> an already <span style='background-color:lightcyan'>ongoing rise of digital engagement</span>, caused by the beginning of the next school year\n\nThe first one is the most common case, since states probably reopened Restaurants, Gyms, Bars and Cinemas in this period because students are likely to go there the most during summer, thus benefitting the economy. Note also that such reopenings often occur closely with the obligation of face masks, probably a way to mitigate the effects of reopenings by limiting the repercussions extended closures would have on the economy. In most cases the reduction continued also slight after the reopenings, but probably it is mostly (not entirely) an effect of the school year being finished; reopenings <b>might have exhacerbated</b> the trend, explaining why the difference between spring and summer is so sharp, but we cannot be sure about the magnitude of their contribution to the inevitable fall during summer.\n\nIf we take into account the second case, anyway, policies issued in concurrence with rising digital engagement levels due to the beginning of the school year seem not to have had particularly remarkable effects on slowering this trend (look at the Gyms Reopening policies issued in this kind of situation). \n\nThe next category of policies is a bit different, since they affect U.S. residents in a more indirect way, and on the economic side: we are talking about Economic Support policies. The consequences of Economic Support policies on Digital Engagement are more subtle since their direct effects usually impact adult workers rather than more or less young students. Still, the fact that we call these policies 'Support' policies is not random: they provide relief to U.S. residents, mostly in economic and financial terms. Such relief thus improves, even if temporarily, the economic status of individuals in the United States or, as we observed in previous points, the economic wellbeing. We now know that economic wellbeing is consistently related to the levels of digital engagement, hence policies that improve overall welfare are also likely to increase, or contribute to increase, the engagement of students towards digital learning technologies.

Interestingly, both of them correlate with increases in digital engagement (see Washington, New Hampshire, Connecticut), with the exception of situation of steady decrease (end of school year, regularly). Eviction Moratorium correlates with increases in Digital Engagement even more compared to them, but Late Fee Ban policy occurs in different contexts; we would expect it to have relieving effects on the population, thus pushing the student engagement on digital learning upwards, but the picture is slightly different. Whereas Eviction Moratorium seems to be positively correlated with rising engagement, except for a couple of cases in which it is issued after engagement itself reached a peak (New Jersey, New Hampshire), Late Fee Ban is always emanated during the end of 2019-2020 school year: digital engagement is inevitably falling, hence the effect of such policy on it cannot be assessed. The same reasoning as before could apply, accounting for the possibility of Late Fee Ban being a driver, together with other factors like the end of school year, of such fall; anyway, this is unlikely to reflect the reality: unless it carries some veiled implication, a policy that economically supports citizens <b>will not cause students to reduce their focus towards digital learning, especially in a context in which digital learning is necessary</b>. A different situation could have been composed by a support policy issued together with the announcement of return to full face-to-face learning: in this case, digital learning would have become an enhancement tool rather than a necessity, thus disjoining it from the positive effect on the economic side. \n\nLet us make an example: the pandemic has enhanced economic and social diversity, when dealing with digital engagement, due to more vulnerable categories having difficulties to afford the necessary technologies (economic vulnerability), for instance; improving their situation on the economic side would indeed have very appreciable effects, but this would translate on digital engagement increases only as long as the interested actors feel it necessary/worth to spend a part of their already little wealth on digital learning. Nevertheless, Digital learning is or paramount importance for students, even more nowadays, during pandemic times; hence, considering these arguments, a policy which supports population on the economic side during such a situation is very unlikely to have negative effects on that population students' engagement towards the digital learning technologies that emerged and that are still emerging.\n\nLet's thus move on to the second portion of Support policies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#grouped_by_date: by day; weekly: by week\nfig = px.line(weekly, x='time', y='engagement_index', facet_col=\"state\", facet_col_wrap=3, facet_col_spacing=0.05)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title={\n        'text': \"Mean Daily Engagement Index per Week - Support 2 Policies Issued\",\n        'y':0.99,\n        'x':0.5,\n        'xanchor': 'center',\n        'yanchor': 'top'},    \n    template='plotly_dark',\n    height=1500,\n    margin=dict(\n        l=4,\n        r=8,\n    ))\nfig.update_yaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True, title_text='')\nfig.update_xaxes(matches=None, showticklabels=True)\nfig.layout.xaxis16.title = {\n    'font':{\n            'color':'red'\n            },\n    'text':'- Utilities Shutoff Moratorium Start'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis17.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'blue'\n            },\n    'text':'- Utilities Reconnection Start'}\n    \nfig.layout.xaxis18.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'green'\n            },\n    'text':'- Extended Benefits Program'}\n\nfig.layout.xaxis13.title = { \n    'font':{\n            'color':'orange'\n            },\n    'text':'- Two Weeks U.I.

The reason behind this is pretty straightforward and similar to what already saw with the emanation of Late Fee Ban policy: occurring always between May and June, which are, respectively, the periods of strongest decrease and of lower level in digital engagement due to the end of the school year, the Extended Benefits Program cannot offset the too strong and actually inevitable decrease in student engagement; we already experienced a similar situation before, but now it is even more tangible.

For the great majority of policies, they are issued in periods of lowering Digital Engagement (like summer) or local reductions of its levels (reductions that we can observe multiple times in the 'Outbreak' phase, from September onwards); it is reasonable to consider these events, which actually represent the end (or reduction) of economic relief on several families whose financial stability has been damaged (or worsened, in case of already vulnerable situations) by the pandemic, a <span style='background-color:lightcyan'><b>contributing factor</b></span> to the downward peaks in students engagement towards digital learning technologies; some exception holds, mostly represented by some state-specific occurrences.\n\nOverall, assessing the effect of a policy on digital engagement levels is not trivial, but taking into account the whole context (policy meaning and implications, period of issue, etc.) allows us to draw more reasonable conclusions. Indeed, the evidence shows that some policies show a strong correlation with the behavior of digital engagement, with both positive and negative relationships; some of these policies appear thus likely to be some of the various drivers behind increases/decreases in student engagement towards digital learning technologies, and understanding this means understanding more deeply the story behind Digital Learning itself.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style='background-color:lime;width:60%;margin-left:20%;box-shadow: 3px 6px 6px gray'>\n<b>\n<font size='4'>\n    KEY INSIGHTS:\n</font>\n<font size='2'>\n    <ul>\n    <li> Government policies seem to exhacerbate some trends in digital engagement, but they are unlikely to reverse them (e.g., no pandemic-related government policy is able to make digital engagement rise during summer)</li>\n        <li> Closure policies occur in periods of increasing digital engagement, probably contributing to such increases</li>\n        <li> Reopenings often correlate with decreasing digital engagement</li>\n        <li> Policies giving economic relief seem to be contributing factors to strengthening digital engagement </li> \n    </ul>\n</font>\n</b>\n</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"background-color:cyan\"><b>8. Wrap-up</b></div>\n\nDuring the course of our journey up to here, we encountered a high number of factors affecting digital engagement in essentially two ways:\n* Influencing the overall level of digital engagement (factors like Income, per-pupil Total Expenditure, ...)\n* Influencing the trend of digital engagement in a transitory way, with subsequent peaks (Government policies, Holidays, ...)\n\nUnderstanding both typologies of factors is important to arrive at well-founded conclusions, and among them the first category is of more interest for our purposes; we now know what are the factors, transitory and non-transitory, influencing student engagement towards digital learning technologies and we are currently interested in is reducing the gap between all the 'categories' of digital learners, which are more easily delineated through the analysis of factors affecting digital engagement levels non-transiently. Still, the insights derived from the steps throughout the transiently-influencing factors may be crucial, as well: transience does not imply uniqueness and unrepeatability, and such transient events might occur again in the future; holidays for example, are cyclical, and the Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet and related government policies may be issued again. Our journey touched various issues, vulnerabilities and facts that, in most of the cases, existed much before Covid-19 and whose strength has only been exhacerbated by the advent of the virus. As the digital learning setting seems to be destined to being increasingly engaged by students in the United States and worldwide, partially due to the increasingly advanced technologies and partly pushed by the pandemic, the need to narrow the highlighted divide is now more crucial than ever: there is always room for improvement and if this is true in all the facets of life, it is even more so in the learning setting; my aim was thus to uncover and depict the directions in which regard those improvements need to be made, hopefully helping to facilitate the process towards a more conducive learning environment for each student. \n\n<p style='font-family:cursive'><font size='5'>Thank you for your attention, and a true good luck to all the students and learners, and to everyone who is reading!</font></p>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"background-color:cyan\"> <b>9.
