While many white-collar workers were able to seamlessly transition to working remotely, a much larger percentage of blue collar workers lost their jobs [[1](https://www.joblist.com/trends/working-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-class-differences)]. Analogously, recent data from NWEA suggests that while high-income children's performance on reading and math measures grew at a reasonable rate during the pandemic, growth in reading and math performance of low-income children was significantly less than in normal years [[2](https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-reading-and-math-achievement-in-the-2020-2021-school-year/)]. These impacts of the pandemic, both on low-income children and their parents, have the unfortunate outcome of growing an already-gaping chasm between the rich and poor in America. \n\nUnderstanding the sources of these divisions is critical to ameliorating them. This dataset provided the opportunity to gather meaningful insights relevant to that goal. In my investigation of the dataset, I sought to examine how children from higher-income and lower-income backgrounds experienced the pandemic with respect to their use of educational technology, whose already-central importance to the student experience before the pandemic reached new heights when schooling became remote. I did this in three steps.\n1. I first examined changes to overall educational technology use by each income group (as indexed by percentage of children receiving free or reduced lunch) over the course of 2020. \n2. After identifying key differences between income groups in changes to overall technology use, I sought to identify whether any individual products or product categories were driving these differences. \n3. Finally, wanting to explore links between impacts on children and impacts on their parents, I examined whether state-level interventions intended to provide economic support during the pandemic were differentially correlated with educational technology use for lower-income vs higher-income children.\n\nIn this notebook, I start by presenting the key findings of this investigation, as well as some recommendations based on those findings. I then walk through my exploration of the data for each of the three steps above, presenting relevant figures and statistics. I conclude with a discussion of insights arising from and limitations of this investigation, finishing with suggestions for next steps. As a note to the reader, this is my first Kaggle submission and really my first time trying to make a notebook for others to read, so I apologize if any part of it is confusing. I made the notebook so that it should hopefully compile just by pressing \"Run All.\"\n\n<b>Key findings</b>\n* There was a spring peak in engagement and access across all technologies for the wealthiest kids aligning with the timing of school closures in March and early April, which starkly contrasted with an overall decline in technology use through the spring for the two lowest-income groups.\n* The largest driver of the peak among the wealthiest group by Google Docs. Other income groups increased their use of this tool, but the amount of increase among the wealthy was by far the greatest, compounding already high levels of usage by this group (especially of Google Docs) before the pandemic. Despite moderate increases in Google Docs usage by other groups, their overall decrease in learning technology use through the spring was driven by decreases in other tools such as digital learning platforms that were not heavily used by the wealthiest before the pandemic. \n* Leaving aside one outlier district, the greatest decreases in technology use in the spring were in the lowest income group, driven in large part by decreases in use of digital learning platforms -- specifically reading and math software, such as Lexia, i-Ready, and myON Reader. \n* By the fall, use of reading and math software had largely not resumed for the lowest-income group, reflecting a gap (at least as of late 2020) remaining to be filled. This gap is consistent with independent findings of disproportionate decreases in reading and math among low-income students after a year of the pandemic (NWEA, 2021).\n* There were no significant correlations between technology use and a measure of state social support, though this may be due to limited data. The correlation between technology engagement and unemployment insurance did appear like it trended toward greater in the low-income group than the high-income group, which would be consistent with this support being more critical for blue-collar workers to bolster their children's engagement with technology.\n\n<b>Recommendations</b>\n* Conduct qualitative research to understand more deeply the enormous difference in Google Docs usage between the wealthiest group and everyone else. How do different income groups use Google Docs differently, and what kinds of activities are responsible for the large divide in usage? Do the wealthiest use Google Docs in ways that will in the long run further entrench their socioeconomic status? How can insights about that be used to increase educational and societal equity?\n* Identify ways to fill the gap left by decreases in use of digital learning platforms, especially reading and math software, that has disproportionately impacted lower income kids. As the pandemic persists and school closures continue to be a regular occurrence, can districts more effectively use software they already have in remote instruction, or should they alternatively adopt technologies that are better suited to learning from home? What other interventions can be used to help get these kids up to speed?\n* As time passes and more metrics are collected, look at further correlations between measures of social support and technology engagement, as well as between changes in the use of reading and math technologies and child reading and math performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# (1) Overall changes in educational technology use\nI first sought to examine how children's overall educational technology use, collapsing across all products measured, differed among income groups.

playing around a bit with the data, I realized that some non-trivial normalization would be required to allow us to make reasonable comparisons across districts and groups. This is because every school uses a different set of products, and products that are not used by a district are not present in the dataset. Thus, for the same total number of page views across all products used by a district on a given day, taking a simple mean across all products would inaccurately report a district that used five products as having twice the usage as a district that used ten products, since the summed engagement of the former would be divided by five and the latter by ten. To address this, in calculating monthly total engagement and percent access, I chose to take the sum of these metrics across all days in a month and all products used by the district. This results in an engagement index that reflects the total number of page views per thousand students over the course of each month. The results for the percentage access and engagement index are highly correlated, so in this investigation I focus on engagement index, as the meaning of the engagement index when summed across products is easier to think about.\n\nI also noticed that there is one outlier district in the lowest income group (district 9536, in an urban center in New York) that significantly ramped up technology use in the early months of the pandemic. While looking more deeply at this district to understand its approach to the pandemic would be very interesting, I chose to exclude it from this analysis because it very clearly departs from the trend of the low-income groups.\n\nHaving settled on using the sum, I summed across all page views for all products by each income group for each district in each month.

To do this, I averaged engagement by income group and state over the course of the entire year, and correlated this with the maximum unemployment amount in each state for each income group.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"total2020_state_df = free_reduced_sum_by_district_df.groupby(['state', 'pct_free_reduced_binned'], observed = True, as_index = False)['pct_access', 'engagement_index'].mean().reset_index()\nstate_covid_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/covid19-database/COVID-19 US state policy database 3_29_2021.csv\")\nsocial_supports_df = state_covid_df[[\"STATE\", \"UIMAXAMT\"]].iloc[4:, :]\nengagement_and_social_support_df = pd.merge(total2020_state_df, social_supports_df, left_on = \"state\", right_on = \"STATE\")\nengagement_and_social_support_df[\"UIMAXAMT\"] = pd.to_numeric(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"UIMAXAMT\"])","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.201977Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.202352Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.264342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.202317Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.263436Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"linregress(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"engagement_index\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"0-20%\"],\n            pd.to_numeric(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"UIMAXAMT\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"0-20%\"]))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.265452Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.265684Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.276875Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.265657Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.276046Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"linregress(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"engagement_index\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"20-60%\"],\n            pd.to_numeric(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"UIMAXAMT\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"20-60%\"]))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.279255Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.279695Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.292967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.279662Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.291854Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"linregress(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"engagement_index\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"60-100%\"],\n            pd.to_numeric(engagement_and_social_support_df[\"UIMAXAMT\"][engagement_and_social_support_df[\"pct_free_reduced_binned\"] == \"60-100%\"]))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.294393Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.294613Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.306774Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.294589Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T23:50:19.305992Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I did not find a significant correlation between unemployment amount and engagement for any of the groups, though correlations did appear more positive for the low income group (R = 0.18) as compared to the high-income group (R = -0.40), which is consistent with what I had expected.

In my view, the most meaningful findings are the increase in the use of Google Docs by the high-income group, which is worthy of further research to understand what's driving it, and the decrease in the use of reading and math software by the low-income group, which points to the need for further support for these students. \n\n<b>Limitations</b>\n* The number of districts in each group was uneven, with far fewer districts in the lowest income group. A larger and more balanced sample size would be ideal.\n* There was a great deal of missingness in the data, including the names of products (nearly half were excluded as a result of this) and districts without income designations. \n* As mentioned, there was an interesting outlier in the low-income group that was excluded for this analysis but would be interesting to try to examine in more detail.\n\n<b>Insights</b>\n* The wealthy ramped up their use of the remote-friendly technologies they were already primarily using. At the same time, students from lower income groups adopted these technologies to a lesser extent while leaving behind others, likely many of which (like reading and math software) were optimized for in-person use.\n* Much like their adult counterparts, students in the wealthiest group were already working heavily with technologies that could easily be adapted to a remote setting. Foremost among these was Google Docs, which drove a spring peak in learning technology access and engagement in this group, while the lowest-income group saw declines in access and engagement.\n* By contrast, students from lower income groups relied pre-pandemic more heavily on digital learning platforms like literacy and math tools, at least some of which were likely more difficult to adapt to remote instruction\n* This divide between high-income and low-income children parallels the experience of their parents. While white-collar adults experiencing minimal disruption to their work and income as their knowledge economy jobs near-seamlessly transitioned to being remote, blue-collar adults lost employment in the face of both closures and understandable unwillingness to tolerate the significant risks associated with in-person jobs. The disproportionate losses faced by adults (of employment and income stability) and children (of critical learning resources) in lower income groups pose the risk of deepening already existing class divisions. The recommendations presented at the beginning of this document to address inequities in educational access furthered by the pandemic can be a step toward reducing those divisions. \n","metadata":{}}]}
