Problem Statement</font>\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.\n\n* What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n\n* What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n\n* How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?\n\n* How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n\n* Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color=\"#6C8255\">1.2. Overview</font>\n\n### <font color=\"#6C8255\">- Data</font>\nIn this notebook **we exploited additional data source** provided by [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/), [Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker), [The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University](https://edopportunity.org/) which measures spread of Covid-19, state government's response toward pandemic, and various characteristics on school districts especially student's performance and additional socio-economic factors such as ESL learners, income level and overall educational backgrounds. \n\n<br>\n\n### <font color=\"#6C8255\">- Methodology</font>\nUsing our rich dataset, **we studied how recent pandemics have been affected students' learning behavior and analyzed whether it varies along with the socioeconomic background.** We utilized **multivariate regression model with time and location fixed effect** because this allows us to control unobserved factors which vary within a time and location unit, even the data provided lacks information on district characteristics.\n\nWe tried to merge additional information (such as income level, educational attainment, student's previous performance, etc.) even we were not able to identify the district using the given information. To tackle this problem, we **tried to identify the district by generating a cell** (i.e., `state x locale x blkhis student ratio x freereduced lunch ratio x edu expenditure per pupil`) **by acquiring the original dataset for district information from the source** -- [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/), and [Edunomics Lab](https://edunomicslab.org/nerds/). This allowed us to find out which districts lie in each cell. By using this information we have added various representative values (i.e., mean, median, min, max) of additional district information within a cell level. \n\nAmong 176 districts in the whole sample, we used 93 that report five variables - state, locale, blkhis ratio, freereduced ratio, and expenditure per pupil - which are needed to construct a cell. Using those districts, we classified them into 65 unique cells, to match with our additional data acquired.\n\n<br>\n\n### <font color=\"#6C8255\">- Findings</font>\nWe have found followings:\n* We found that the spread of `Covid-19` and the implementation of `school closure policy` **are positively affected on online learning engagement**.\n\n* The impact of `school closure` gets increased as more Covid-19 cases appear, which implies that **students living in the district where 'Covid-19' is highly infected, would access and engage more on online learning products when school is closed.**\n\n* There is a heterogeneous on online learning engagement along with socioeconomic characteristics of students -- (1) having more black and Hispanic student tends to access and engage less, (2) and **economically disadvantaged students (proxied by the eligibility of free lunch program or median income level in district) tends to engage less than those who are not** on average as well. (3) Districts with **more expenditure on education does not necessarily increase online learning product**, (4) but districts in **rural and suburb area tend to engage less** relative to city and town area. (5) More ELL (English Language Learner) students and (6) districts that had higher average test scores are likely to access and engage more in online learning.\n    \n* There is also a heterogeneous on online learning engagement along with the type of products -- **'School and Districts Operation'** (e.g., Google Classroom) tends to be **accessed less by 10.8% during school closure**, and engagement has been **decreased most rapidly** compared to any other product types. However, **'Classroom Management Tools'** (e.g., 'Zoom' and 'Google Hangout') was **engaged and accessed 65.7% and 12.6% more respectively.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color=\"#6C8255\">1.3.

The dataset tracks 18 government policy responses in three different policy areas including `containment` (e.g., restriction in movement, closure of workplace or school), `health system` (e.g., accessibility of Covid-19 testing, amount of vaccine investment), and `economic support` (e.g., income support, debt relief to citizens).
