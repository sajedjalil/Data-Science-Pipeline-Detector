But after September the situation is restored and all regions are back to their pre pandemic level percentage access and engagement data.\n\nAnother point to be noted is City based engagement index and pct access is lower compared to the Rural based engagement index and percentage access.\n\nIn terms of percentage access of students, the Suburb region has seen increase in levels after the pandemic whereas the percentage access has slightly gone down in Rural areas.\n\nThere is an increase in engagement index for all regions except Town where it remains in the same range.\n(Suburb region has higher pct access and engagement index due to higher no of districts)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"index=0 ##For creating keys in timeAndLocaleWiseDat dictionary\ntimeAndLocaleWiseData=OrderedDict()\nfor locale in ['Suburb','Rural','City','Town']:\n    engagement_index=0\n    pct_access=0\n    count=0\n    n_products=0\n    for i in dfDistrict[dfDistrict['locale']==locale]['district_id']:\n        df=load('../input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/engagement_data/'+str(i)+'.csv')\n        df=df.groupby('time').mean()\n        df.reset_index(inplace=True)\n        timeWiseData=OrderedDict()\n        for j in range(len(df)):\n            date=df.loc[j]['time']\n            engagement_index=df.loc[j]['engagement_index']\n            pct_access=df.loc[j]['pct_access']\n            if date not in timeWiseData:\n                timeWiseData[date]={'engagement_index':engagement_index,'pct_access':pct_access}\n            else:\n                timeWiseData[date]['engagement_index']=(timeWiseData[date]['engagement_index']+engagement_index)/2\n                timeWiseData[date]['pct_access']=(timeWiseData[date]['pct_access']+pct_access)/2\n    for m in sorted(list(timeWiseData.keys())):\n        a=timeWiseData[m]['engagement_index']\n        b=timeWiseData[m]['pct_access']\n        timeAndLocaleWiseData.update({index:{'date':m,'locale':locale,'engagement_index':a,'pct_access':b}})\n        index=index+1\ntimeAndLocaleWiseDataDF=pd.DataFrame(timeAndLocaleWiseData).transpose()\ntimeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['date']=pd.to_datetime(timeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['date'])\ntimeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['engagement_index']=timeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['engagement_index'].astype('float')\ntimeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['pct_access']=timeAndLocaleWiseDataDF['pct_access'].astype('float')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T17:36:40.639352Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T17:36:40.639642Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T17:37:24.599001Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-14T17:36:40.639602Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-14T17:37:24.597966Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig=plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\ngs=fig.add_gridspec(2,1)\nax1=fig.add_subplot(gs[0,0])\nax2=fig.add_subplot(gs[1,0])\n\nfor s in ['top','right']:\n    ax1.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n    ax2.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n    \nsns.lineplot(x='date',y='engagement_index',data=timeAndLocaleWiseDataDF,hue='locale',palette='bright',ax=ax1)\nsns.lineplot(x='date',y='pct_access',data=timeAndLocaleWiseDataDF,hue='locale',palette='bright',ax=ax2)\n\nax1.tick_params(left=False,bottom=False)\nax1.set(ylabel='Engagement Index',xlabel='Date')\nax1.set_xlabel(ax1.get_xlabel(),fontsize=15,fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_ylabel(ax1.get_ylabel(),fontsize=15,fontweight='bold')\n\nax2.tick_params(left=False,bottom=False)\nax2.set(xlabel='Date',ylabel='Percentage Access')\nax2.set_xlabel(ax2.get_xlabel(),fontsize=15,fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_ylabel(ax2.get_ylabel(),fontsize=15,fontweight='bold')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T17:37:24.60042Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T17:37:24.600749Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T17:37:25.761149Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-14T17:37:24.600717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-14T17:37:25.760123Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The below section plots the percentage access and engagement index state wise\nOnly states having more than 2 districts has been considered.
