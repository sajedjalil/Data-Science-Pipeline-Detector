The competition is part of a collaborative effort between National Football League (NFL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to assist in the development of the best sports injury surveillance and mitigation program in the world.\n\nIf you participated in the 2020 NFL Impact Detection competition this dataset may look familiar to you. While last year's competition was focused on detecting helmet impacts from video footage - this competition challenges competitors to correctly assign each helmet to its associated player. To solve this problem, Kagglers will need to leverage both video footage and NFL's Next Gen Stats (NGS) tracking data.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\n\n# Read in data files\nBASE_DIR = '../input/nfl-health-and-safety-helmet-assignment'\n\n# Labels and sample submission\nlabels = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/train_labels.csv')\nss = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/sample_submission.csv')\n\n# Player tracking data\ntr_tracking = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/train_player_tracking.csv')\nte_tracking = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/test_player_tracking.csv')\n\n# Baseline helmet detection labels\ntr_helmets = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/train_baseline_helmets.csv')\nte_helmets = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/test_baseline_helmets.csv')\n\n# Extra image labels\nimg_labels = pd.read_csv(f'{BASE_DIR}/image_labels.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T15:04:15.405544Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T15:04:15.406055Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T15:04:21.902863Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T15:04:15.405916Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T15:04:21.901851Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is the goal of this competition?\n\nSimply put, we are trying to assign the correct player \"label\" on helmets in NFL game footage. Labels consist of a value H (for home team) and V (for visiting team) followed by the player's jersey number. Player labels are provided within the NGS tracking data for each play. A perfect submission would correctly identify the helmet box for every helmet in every frame of video- and assign that helmet the correct player label.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How does scoring work?\n\nThe scoring used for this competition is `Weighted Accuracy`, where detected helmets involved in an impact are weighted 1000x more than non-impact helmets. This scoring is designed specifically because ultimately the NFL will be using this algorithm to assign helmet impacts to players.\n\nTo reduce gamification of this metric additional restrictions are placed on submissions. They are:\n1. Submission boxes must have at least a 0.35 [Intersection over Union (IoU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) with the ground truth helmet box.\n2. Each ground truth helmet box will only be paired with one helmet box per frame in the submitted solution.  For each ground truth box, the submitted box with the highest IoU will be considered for scoring.\n3. No more than 22 helmet predictions per video frame (the maximum number of players participating on field at a time). In some situations, sideline players can be seen in the video footage. Sideline players' helmets are not scored in the grading algorithm and can be ignored. Sideline players will have the helmet labels \"H00\" and \"V00\". Sideline players should not be included in the submission to avoid exceeding the 22-box and unique label constraints.\n4. A player's helmet label must only be predicted once per video frame, i.e. no duplicated labels per frame.\n5. All submitted helmet boxes must be unique per video frame, i.e. no identical (left, right, height and width) boxes per frame.\n\n\nThe `check_submission` function can be used to check if your submission meets the above requirements.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def check_submission(sub):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks that the submission meets all the requirements.\n\n    1.
