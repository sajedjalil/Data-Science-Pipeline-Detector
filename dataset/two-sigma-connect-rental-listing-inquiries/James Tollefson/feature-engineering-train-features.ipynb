I have been having a rough time creating numeric features I could feed through a machine learning algorithm from the pandas Series of lists contained in train['features']. So I've been doing some studying to improve my meager Python skills and the solution below is what I have arrived at. It quickly and easily makes a new feature out of any item from the train.features/test.features column that you might want to look at."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"58c528fa-ae51-08fc-e947-433c0c2ba401"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d7f58ab6-a675-d303-dfde-f50b38573cb3"},"source":"One quick note: because of the limiting computing power available in Kaggle kernels I have chopped the dataframe down to just ten rows.

Please upvote this kernel if you decide to use my code or you find what I've done here useful. I'm always in the hunt for medals, even if I am a beginner at this stuff.
