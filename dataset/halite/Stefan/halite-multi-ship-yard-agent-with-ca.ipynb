I started from a simple greedy heuristic and extended it to handle multiple ships and shipyards, making it a lot more effective. The agent also tries to avoid collisions with other ships and has a few other tricks. This is the main idea:\n\n* Spawn new ships up to a configured maximum number of ships. \n* Let each ship collect halite greedily by choosing its own destination that's free and different from the other ships' destinations. \n* Once a ship reaches a configured halite load, it returns to the closest shipyard to drop off the collected hailte. \n* If the next shipyard is too far (configurable), the ship converts to a new shipyard (if there's enough halite). This helps avoid losing too much halite during movement.\n* Avoid collisions with own ships and do not move into enemy ships or shipyards.\n* A few other, smaller tricks (see the code)\n\nThis is by no means perfect and there is still a lot of room for improvement, but I believe it's a good starting point for more advanced agents. \n\n**If you like the notebook, I'd appreciate an upvote!**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Auxiliary Code\n\nI created several auxiliary classes to keep the implementation cleaner and easier to extend.\n\n### The Halite Board\n\nTo be used as static class without instantiation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\n\n\nclass Board:\n    \"\"\"Collection of useful, static functions on the board.
