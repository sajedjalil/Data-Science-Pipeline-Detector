They are intended to be examples of fairly intuitive strategies that mostly boil down to \"grab as much halite as you can, as quickly as you can\".\n\nI doubt either of them will earn a particularly high rank in the competition, but they may be useful test opponents for more complex strategies.\n\nI have tried to make the code relatively clear, but there may still be some rough edges or comments that don't quite match up, so please let me know if you find anything that's off."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install kaggle-environments"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 1.

For example, if you are earning 5% return on your financial investments, then a 2020 dollar is worth $1.05 dollars in 2021.\n\nApplying a similar concept here, we assign some rate at which halite decays in value over time (default to losing 5% of its value every turn). In addition, we understand halite in a ship to be worth less based on how many turns it would take to deliver it to a shipyard (losing both the movement cost and the time-value over the expected return trip).\n\nThis agent has some things in common with the \"Planned Agent\" - both effectively are performing a recursive search over the possible moves of each ship. However, unlike that agent, which really only understands success in terms of the delivery of halite to the shipyard, this bot understands the value of intermediate states, and can therefore only search a much smaller set of future moves while at the same time making more reasonable tradeoffs between things like \"stay here and mine another 500 halite\" vs. \"move closer to the shipyard\".\n\nIt has a much higher tendency to wander away from the shipyard if it finds a resource-rich spot, so I gave it the ability to recognize when it would be more valuable to convert a ship than to cart all of the halite home, by assuming that its resource yield is the greater of [the current-time value of the halite it has if it were to cart it to the nearest shipyard] and [the yield after converting in place and then building a new ship to replace this one]. Note that it doesn't need to perform this conversion immediately - it can still plan more movement and harvesting knowing that at any time it can convert.\n\nThere are a couple of parameters that might be worth tweaking - I optimized them based on the assumption of a 400-turn game and a 30,000 halite, 17-length board with 2 players. They are explained below, but, other than the time-value ratio, are mostly related to limits on building more ships (on the assumption that there's no point in building them if they won't recoup their cost).\n\nPotential weaknesses:\n\n- Like the \"planned agent\", it only avoids colliding with its own ships, and completely disregards those of other players.\n- Although it does in some situations create new shipyards, it doesn't assign any value to actually having shipyards, whether as a source of more ships, to reduce dropoff congestion, or to be close to areas of high resources (although it often does tend to place them near distant resource clusters as a consequence of the math). It similarly doesn't recognize that in some scenarios, converting might also increase the effective value of the halite in nearby ships.\n- Similarly, basically assigns no value to having ships (and uses other, clumsier mechanisms for deciding when to stop building them).\n- Again like the \"planned agent\", it treats each ship as an individual. Other than avoiding crashing into its own ships, it doesn't attempt to coordinate them in some kind of mutually-beneficial way.\n- It just immediately places a shipyard on the first turn, even though it might make more sense to locate it elsewhere.\n\nThese are also noted in the comments below where relevant, along with a couple suggested changes that might be worth exploring."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nimport traceback\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\ndef get_time_value_agent(time_value_ratio = 0.95, min_turns_to_spawn=20, max_ships = 200, spawn_payoff_factor = 8.0, debug = False):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to define an agent.\n    \n    Exists so I can pass different top-level attributes to agents with the same logic.\n    \n    Returns the central function for an agent (see immediately below).\n    \n    This particular bot is based on the premise of the 'time-value' of a resource,\n    where you assume that the value of harvesting a resource later is less than\n    the value of harvesting now (or conversely that the value of having it now\n    is higher than the value of having it later).
