R.](mailto:arunprathap@gmail.com)\n\nI am sharing my experience and code submitted to Halite IV Competition sponsored by Two Sigma hosted in Kaggle platform. This is the first Featured competition in Kaggle in which I am participating and I am very glad to reach the silver line. There were many ups and downs in the journey, but the end is sweet as always.\n\n### Snapshots\n\n[One of my favourite episodes where I beat opponents with skill level above me.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-3485447)\n\n[Another one where I beat higher level submissions of opponents in Top 15](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-3476886)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\n### How I came to Kaggle?\n\nI have programming experience in C++, Java, etc through my B.Tech / Masters of Computer Applications courses and as part of my job at VSSC/ISRO. \n\nOn a quest to acquire new skills, I started doing online courses in Machine Learning and Python during the CoViD '19 Lockdown period. And I earned quite a number of [IBM Digital Credentials](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/arun-p-r/badges) and specializations/certificates. \n\nI was eager to get some hands-on experience and my colleague Kishan Kumar Mishra suggested Kaggle to me. It was an excellent suggestion as with each day since I joined Kaggle, I am learning new things that I couldn't find in any course. The exposure to ideas is mindblowing and I am overwhelmed with new techniques and models. \n\nCurrently I am working on implementing a Transformer based model for Stanford OpenVaccine Challenge in Kaggle and it is driving me nuts by each passing day ... (Since I prefer build from scratch method, not because there are not enough resources available, but that way I will learn more -- Though I copy baselines in competitions I am not serious about like I did for Cornell Birdcall Competition that ended last week)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How I met Halite?\n\nTitanic was my starting point as it is the place where most Kagglers start their journey. And these diamonds used to pop up in my homepage as simulation competition Halite (I didn't realise they were spaceships at first) and I ignored them for a month thinking the competition is all about Reinforcement Learning. \n\nAnd I was thinking like Simulation Competitions can wait till I complete some course in Reinforcement Learning. Then one fine morning, I decided to explore all currently active competitions in Kaggle and to my surprise found that Halite is very much similar to the maze solving robots that we used to develop while in college. And then I started mining Halite....\n\nI decided Halite is my Python hands-on and being my first competition, I decided to go ahead with rule based programming and my target was a code that will be as good as the code I write in C++/Java. And definitely I am not satisfied in this aspect as my code still has many bugs/leakages/inefficient loops which prompts me to update my Python skills and I have shortlisted a few next level courses for perusal."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Progression in Halite\n\nI started with the Starter code provided for the competition and with each improvement(?) that I did, my score came down by around 50 per submission consistently till my score reached around 300. Then I started getting the hang of things and score started improving by 100 per day till 800. Then it took me a week to cross 900, 2 days to cross 1000, 2 weeks to cross 1100 and another week to cross 1200. 1230 (for 1 week approx with rank 35) was my best score in Halite IV. \n\nI did a total of about 190 submissions with 131 major versions and others being minor versions for changes. At the end of submission deadline, my best score was around 1190 (ranked 42) and I had multiple copies of my 3 best submission (around 3 each of them) fighting among each other for becoming my best score in the final week. \n\nWith two days to go, my best submission is at rank 40 with the three best submissions scoring 1208, 1196 and 1189 and with current ratings my final rank will be in 38-43 range."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Strategy : Tends to None\n\nBe optimistic when you are winning and be pessimistic when you are losing. Do the best that you can. Get as much halite as you can, spawn as many ships as you can if you are winning, make ships lightweight in the blitz and hope for the best. \n\nThis particular \"strategy of having no strategy\" evolved from my Evolutionary game theory based Bourgeoisie strategy (major versions 100-131) submissions scoring well below my old submission 47. So I went back to my submission 47 with two weeks left in the competition and started applying bux fixes and improvements. Finally with 21 minor versions in submission 47, my best bots were 47.0 (1196 bot), 47.12 (1208 bot) and 47.20 (1189 bot). In the last two days, I submitted multiple copies of these three bots which was a good move from the results as I can see."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Submission File"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"submission.py is the output file that is to contain the definition of the agent that will be deployed by the halite engine hosted in kaggle.
