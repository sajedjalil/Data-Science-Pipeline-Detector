I have made a few notebooks prior to this with different agents,and I was making good progress, but as the script became more complicated I found it hard to keep up with what was going on.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/d3/69/e5d369ecc7b99d71963050c5f6f0479a.jpg)\n\nI competed solo in Halite 3 and came in position ~300 (I think), so I have the general jist of the task but I am still very much a beginner in all aspects.\n\nIn Halite 3, there was much more help and documentation in how to get involved and start. From reading the discussion page here, something similar may be in the works. I hope it does as it opens up the competition to much more people and I wouldn't of been able to compete if it wasn't for that.\n\n\nI hope you get something out of this, even if it is how not to do it\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Submission file <a name=\"submission\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile submission.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nclass gameInfo:\n    '''Infomation about the state of the game'''\n    def __init__(self, observation):\n        #player id\n        self.player = observation['player']\n        #
