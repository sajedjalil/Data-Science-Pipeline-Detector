Machine learning automatically learns from data, and often performs better given more (useful/relevant) features. However, we still need to be careful with correlations between the features and the target. In this competition, several dataframes are available:\n![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)\n\nNote that this is my first kaggle notebook, and I do refer hugely the work of [Will Koehrsen](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen) [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction). So this notebook is meant to get familiar with the competition data on top of his excellent work as a tutorial. \n\nIn addition to the `application` data, we also have more datasets such as the `bureau` and `bureau_balance` data:\n\n* **bureau**: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau and is identified by the SK_ID_BUREAU, Each loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n* **bureau_balance**: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length.\n* **previous_application**: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV.\n* **POS_CASH_BALANCE**: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n* **credit_card_balance**: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n* **installments_payment**: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment.\n\nIf you don't have domain knowledge of loans and credits, no worries because me neither. In this notebook, we'll have a basic travel from data to features and classification. We'll also go through some basic concepts in regards during the travel. Note that this notebook also refers to several other notebooks, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\nNow let's begin."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# File system manangement\nimport os\n\n# pandas and numpy for data manipulation\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"># 1.

Basically, feature engineering is a bunch of techniques that collect features out of the original data, which is often followed by feature selection (choosing from most useful {often subjective}, or dimension reducing). \n\n> Currently, many mature routines of features engineering are already available along with algorithms, methods and tricks.There are also some toolboxes for semi-/autonomous feature engineering out there.
