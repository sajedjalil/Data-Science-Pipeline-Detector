Below is the link: [Kaggle | Home Credit Default Risk Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)\n\n\nMany people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n\n![about homecredit](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/about-us-home-credit.jpg)       [Source : Kaggle](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/about-us-home-credit.jpg)\n\nHome Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a\n \nvariety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\nWhile Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dd2428d19fd71f1d5a27920bb33e4b71849cce67"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Statement.\n### Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan ?\n- My analysis will be predicting how capable each applicant is at repaying a loan."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9b6ded79f21acb6b07c02c6a5fc9399c6f16bd1e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Datasets and Inputs.\nThe dataset for this project has been provided by Kaggle. <br>\nData description is below :\nThere are 7 different sources of data:\n+ **application_train/application_test**: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating **0** if the loan was repaid **`Repayers`** and **`1`** for default **`Defaulters`**\n+ **bureau**: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n+ **bureau_balance**: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length.\n+ **previous_application**: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV.\n+ **POS_CASH_BALANCE:** monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n+ **credit_card_balance**: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n+ **installments_payment**: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment.\nFor more information on what each data represents, please read the [PROPOSAL]('/Users/bhetey/version_control/machine-learning/projects/capstone/proposal.pdf'), or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) <br>\n- Below is a diagram of how the data are connected. \n![Data structure](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a57acc2fdc22226c3ca4341bff72130657f6809a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading Data "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"837b914aa817a0401b0a2b661925cab3626b2548","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from __future__ import division\nimport pandas as pd # this is to import the pandas module\nimport numpy as np # importing the numpy module \nimport os # file system management \nimport zipfile # module to read ZIP archive files.\nfrom glob import glob \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Figures inline and set visualization style\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set()\n\n#print(os.listdir(\"../input/*.csv\"))\nfilenames = glob(\"../input/*.csv\")\nfilenames","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"5808cd19933f1a304b3f20340f7a3e79d70c842d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# reading the data with pandas \ndef reading_csv_file(filename):\n    return pd.read_csv(filename)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"67d7d8d3c30c9f84d4063eeae1bb02c68a2a993e","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"app_train = reading_csv_file(filenames[2])\nprint ('Training data shape :{}'.format(app_train.shape))\napp_train.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6fb6ac3673d8644fa8c6d110df39ff6ff5fddf75"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Training data has 307511 rows (*each one represents separate loan*) and 112 featurees (columns) including the TARGET(What is to be predicted)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"91a2d5a02aded7698377edb77486089a9f72ca66","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = app_train.TARGET # y is going to be our target variable\ny.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6d8956410d4fda424f68c9d170d1e30831030771","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"app_test = reading_csv_file(filenames[7])\nprint ('Testing test contains :{}'.format(app_test.shape))\napp_test.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"07826aab8bbe40869e6e8f420ad564b4c876b3cf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Testing set does not have target variable "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e69511e20731dcabc9fd406de952f273e7579a82","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# traing and testing set do not have the same shape. \napp_train.shape == app_test.shape ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"55a2b6869444d7876be4b0314ce264de7ab728da"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data conversion in pandas DataFrame"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2035c260f2e3631d1f6189837a45f14f2e1d423b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# converted all csv in pandas dataframe. \npos_cash_balance = reading_csv_file(filenames[0])\nbureau_balance = reading_csv_file(filenames[1])\nprevious_application = reading_csv_file(filenames[3])\ninstallments_payments = reading_csv_file(filenames[4])\ncredit_card_balance = reading_csv_file(filenames[5])\nbureau = reading_csv_file(filenames[8])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3320e03a20afed238e27df5867baf72ee59ed8f1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"HomeCredit Columns Description gives us the details about each features in the dataset "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"070d58e7c43a8a3495f48e6d82e093387d6efa6c","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this is done for indexing of the joint data later \ndata = (os.listdir(\"../input/\"))\ndata.remove('sample_submission.csv')\ndata","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fbb85ef1c90b0506b63272294a787000b74365d3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d4e34f0d0f61784cf7f59fbd4863690823d82f51","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print (app_train['TARGET'].value_counts())\napp_train.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f54d180f16a79e8d10d8c2c1ea333182f35f1d31"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"+ ### How many people repay loans : \n**Take away here is that**: Looking at the picture below, **`1`** for **Defaulter** and **`0`** for  **Repayers**.

CLASSIFICATION MODELS \nClassification depends on whether the variables we are trying to predict are **Binary or Non-Binary**.\n\n**Binary variables** are those variables where the outcome we are looking are either 1 or 0, True or False. \n\n**Non-Binary variables** are those variables where the outcome we are looking are categorical. for example looking at the dataset and predicting where the
