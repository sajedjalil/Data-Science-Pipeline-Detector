Meaning that the ROC curve is only sensitive to rank ordering\n\n- ROC AU is the probability that the classifier will rank the randomly chosen positive obeservation higher than the randomly chosen negative observation.\n\n- ROC curve can be used to represent more than two classes using the 1 versus all approach.\n\n    - that is if we have 3 classes then we can have 3 ROC curves showing 1 vs (2 and 3), 2 vs (1and 3), 3 vs (1 and 2)\n    \n- Choosing the threshold based on the ROC curve is a business decision ( whether we want to Maximize true positive or we want to minimise false positive)\n\n    - e.g. If we want to flag a fraudulant credit card transaction then we might want to maximize the False positive so as to avoid missing even a single case of fraudulant transaction."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"0fa10cd306d84032be8d4db26dc457ddb5c8724c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# numpy and pandas for data manipulation\nimport numpy as
