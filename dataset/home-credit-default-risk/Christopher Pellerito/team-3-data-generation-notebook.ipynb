Ultimately I decided against this because the most time-consuming part of the whole process is uploading the test and train pickle files into the model notebook - it's >1GB of data and can take 10-15 minutes to upload. Running it through the pipeline and creating dummy columns would only make the data set larger and file transfer slower.
