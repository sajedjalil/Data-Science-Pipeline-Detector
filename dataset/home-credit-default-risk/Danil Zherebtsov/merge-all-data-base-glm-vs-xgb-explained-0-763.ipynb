It is matched by SK_ID_CURR with train/test and where in train/test the SK_ID_CURR do not duplicate (1 for 1 client whom we are trying to classify) in most cases bureau dataframe has multipe indicies of the same client as he/she had applied to multiple loans previously.\n2. in turn bureau_balance even more extends the previous credit information on a greater scale. It contains a separate row for each month of history of every previous credit reported to Credit Bureau (bureau dataframe) and is related to bureau df via SK_ID_BUREAU.\n\nSo the approach we are going to use is to calculate mean of each statistical column out of these both dataframes to include these mean values as features of our clients whom we are trying to classify. For example: mean days overdue for all credits that the client had previously taken.\n\nI have to say that this approach leaves out some information such as categorical columns in some cases. For example the client with SK_ID_CURR = 666 had 7 credits in bureau dataframe, and when we collapse all these credits (grouped by one ID) into one line to indicate mean values for these credits, we will not be able to show a CREDIT_ACTIVE column that has different categorical values as Closed or Active for different previous credits. So this leaves room for some interesting feature engineering here.\n\nSteps that we need to take:\n1. Collapse bureau_balance dataframe to mean values grouped by SK_ID_BUREAU\n2. Merge this with bureau dataframe\n3. Collapse bureau dataframe to mean values grouped by SK_ID_CURR\n4.
