In this situation we can delete these observations if the percentage is low enough, but generally it's preferable to proceed with imputation technique(with mode, mean...), or interpolation for time series. Another appreciated technique if the percentage is high is prediction using machine learning models, the challenge here is to find the right features to be used as predictors, but if data is already anonymized, just forget about it.\n\n> **MAR** : when the missingness is related to one or more observed variable in the data set, for example, \"salary\" variable has missing values for people having \"age\" variable <16 years. This mechanism share the same filling techniques with MCAR, except deleting, it's not allowed to delete any data here because it affect the data distribution and any further analysis based on that will be biased.\n\n> **MNAR** : when the missingness is related to the variable itself, for example when  \"weight\" variable has missing values because concerned people are too obese and don't want to reveale their real weight. \nThis is the hardest one and fortunately the rarest, cause here we can't use simple imputation techniques (imagine you want to impute using the mean, and the average of weights is 73kg, an obese person has clearly more than 100 kg,  this wrong estimation will generate biased and non consistent results), the best way to deal with is prediction techniques if possible.\n\nIn most cases and when we don't know how data have been collected, it's very hard to figure out the mechanism. But going back to literature, we can easily find tons of climate and hydrometeorological studies, in which the presence of missing data is almost a usual thing, and mostly caused by external factors (sensors defection, incorrect measurement, instrument malfunction...etc), thus, we assume that our missing data is MCAR.\n\n\nAnother probably missing data can come out from outliers or invalid values.
