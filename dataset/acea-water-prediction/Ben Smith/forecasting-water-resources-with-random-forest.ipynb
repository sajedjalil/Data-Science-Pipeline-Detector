{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This competition uses nine different datasets, completely independent and not linked to each other. Each dataset can represent a different kind of waterbody. As each waterbody is different from the other, the related features as well are different from each other. So, if for instance we consider a water spring we notice that its features are different from the lake’s one. This is correct and reflects the behavior and characteristics of each waterbody. The Acea Group deals with four different type of waterbodies: water spring (for which three datasets are provided), lake (for which a dataset is provided), river (for which a dataset is provided) and aquifers (for which four datasets are provided).\n\nLet’s see how these nine waterbodies differ from each other.\n\nWaterbody: Auser\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: This waterbody consists of two subsystems, called NORTH and SOUTH, where the former partly influences the behavior of the latter. Indeed, the north subsystem is a water table (or unconfined) aquifer while the south subsystem is an artesian (or confined) groundwater.\n\nThe levels of the NORTH sector are represented by the values of the SAL, PAG, CoS and DIEC wells, while the levels of the SOUTH sector by the LT2 well.\n\nWaterbody: Petrignano\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The wells field of the alluvial plain between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano is fed by three underground aquifers separated by low permeability septa. The aquifer can be considered a water table groundwater and is also fed by the Chiascio river. The groundwater levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperatures and drainage volumes, level of the Chiascio river.\n\nWaterbody: Doganella\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The wells field Doganella is fed by two underground aquifers not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by meteoric infiltration. The upper aquifer is a water table with a thickness of about 30m. The lower aquifer is a semi-confined artesian aquifer with a thickness of 50m and is located inside lavas and tufa products. These aquifers are accessed through wells called Well 1, ..., Well 9. Approximately 80% of the drainage volumes come from the artesian aquifer. The aquifer levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, humidity, subsoil, temperatures and drainage volumes.\n\nWaterbody: Luco\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The Luco wells field is fed by an underground aquifer. This aquifer not fed by rivers or lakes but by meteoric infiltration at the extremes of the impermeable sedimentary layers. Such aquifer is accessed through wells called Well 1, Well 3 and Well 4 and is influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperature and drainage volumes.\n\nWaterbody: Amiata\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: The Amiata waterbody is composed of a volcanic aquifer not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by meteoric infiltration. This aquifer is accessed through Ermicciolo, Arbure, Bugnano and Galleria Alta water springs. The levels and volumes of the four sources are influenced by the parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, hydrometry, temperatures and drainage volumes.\n\nWaterbody: Madonna di Canneto\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: The Madonna di Canneto spring is situated at an altitude of 1010m above sea level in the Canneto valley. It does not consist of an aquifer and its source is supplied by the water catchment area of the river Melfa.\n\nWaterbody: Lupa\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: this water spring is located in the Rosciano Valley, on the left side of the Nera river. The waters emerge at an altitude of about 375 meters above sea level through a long draining tunnel that crosses, in its final section, lithotypes and essentially calcareous rocks. It provides drinking water to the city of Terni and the towns around it.\n\nWaterbody: Arno\nType: River\n\nDescription: Arno is the second largest river in peninsular Italy and the main waterway in Tuscany and it has a relatively torrential regime, due to the nature of the surrounding soils (marl and impermeable clays). Arno results to be the main source of water supply of the metropolitan area of Florence-Prato-Pistoia. The availability of water for this waterbody is evaluated by checking the hydrometric level of the river at the section of Nave di Rosano.\n\nWaterbody: Bilancino\nType: Lake\n\nDescription: Bilancino lake is an artificial lake located in the municipality of Barberino di Mugello (about 50 km from Florence). It is used to refill the Arno river during the summer months. Indeed, during the winter months, the lake is filled up and then, during the summer months, the water of the lake is poured into the Arno river.\n\nEach waterbody has its own different features to be predicted. The table below shows the expected feature to forecast for each waterbody."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[](https://storage.cloud.google.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Acea/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-02%20at%2012.40.17%20PM.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://storage.cloud.google.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Acea/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-02%20at%2012.40.17%20PM.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is of the utmost importance to notice that some features like rainfall and temperature, which are present in each dataset, don’t go alongside the date. Indeed, both rainfall and temperature affect features like level, flow, depth to groundwater and hydrometry some time after it fell down. This means, for instance, that rain fell on 1st January doesn’t affect the mentioned features right the same day but some time later. As we don’t know how many days/weeks/months later rainfall affects these features, this is another aspect to keep into consideration when analyzing the dataset."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Install pmdarima module which we will use to fill in missing stationary values for temperature"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n#from pmdarima.arima import auto_arima\n#from pmdarima.arima import ADFTest\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf\nfrom datetime import datetime, date\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.vector_ar.var_model import VAR\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nfrom math import sqrt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom numpy import asarray\nfrom pandas import read_csv\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\nfrom pandas import concat\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nimport pickle\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6195295%2Fcca952eecc1e49c54317daf97ca2cca7%2FAcea-Input.png?generation=1606932492951317&alt=media)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# AQUIFERS"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Aquifer_Doganella = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Doganella.csv\")\nAquifer_Auser = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Auser.csv\")\nAquifer_Luco = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Luco.csv\")\nAquifer_Petrignano = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Petrignano.csv\")\naquifers_lst = [Aquifer_Petrignano,Aquifer_Doganella,Aquifer_Auser,Aquifer_Luco]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MyPreprocessor:\n    '''If downsample is set to true then the the PreProcessor downsamples data to the granualarity parameter\n    granularity should be either \"7D\" for weekly, or \"M\" for Monthly.\n    \n    The processor will take the average of each feature. if \"get_averages\" is set to True'''\n    \n    def __init__(self,data,features,downsample=False,granularity=None,get_averages=False):\n        self.df = data.copy()\n        self.features = features\n        self.downsample = downsample\n        self.granularity = granularity\n        self.get_averages = get_averages\n        self.PCA = PCA\n\n        \n    def filter_year(self):\n        self.df['Date'] = self.df['Date'].apply(lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, \"%d/%m/%Y\"))\n        self.df = self.df.loc[(self.df['Date']>=self.start_year)]\n        return df\n\n    def fill_zero_volume(self,df):\n        '''Since zero volume is highly unlikely we will replace 0s with null\n        We will also replace the 0 values in Temperature with nan since many observations have this as the default where\n        a real observation is missing.
