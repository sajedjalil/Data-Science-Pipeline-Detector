Here, we develop methodologies for predicting the water levels of nine Italian water bodies. For each water body, the following process is followed: first, an analysis of the available data, and especially the development of strategies for dealing with missing data. Then, the implementation of two machine learning learning algorithms - XGBRegressor and LSTM Neural Networks - to determine which variables most influence water levels, and predict future values of the water levels. The LSTM implementation includes multiple time-step predictions, so the performance of the implementation can be assessed. Each target variable will be predicted 30 days in advance for the entire test set, which is usually 365 days. An interactive widget with a slider is used to visualize these predictions versus their actual values, as well as the mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), for each of the 30 days. The widget is not interactive when viewed in a static Kaggle Jupyter Notebook, but is interactive when the notebook is actively running and the results are being plotted. Due to this shortcoming, a dataframe containing the MAE and RMSE for each of the 30 days is also displayed. \n\nBoth the XGBRegressor and LSTM models are easily modified to predict any number of days (only limited by the amount of training data), and is suited for handling stationary data by differencing, using walk-forward validation, using a simplified attention mechanism, training on synthetic data, and other options. The conclusion will include an example of how to predict water levels for one of the nine water bodies in real time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\n\nFirst, we want to understand the basic model underlying the physical processes that determine how much water is available at any given moment in time. We can use the following equation to achieve this goal. For any given day, \n\ncurrent water level = prior water level + water in - water out\n\n$$w_{current} = w_{prior} + w_{in} - w_{out}$$ \n\nTo make actual predictions easier in the code, we will use the same formula in a different manner:\n\nnext water level = current water level + water in - water out\n\n$$w_{next} = w_{current} + w_{in} - w_{out}$$\n\nNow, we want to analyze each of the components of the right hand side of the latter equation. \n\nThe current water level: for any given day, we know what the water level is.\n\nThe amount of water inflow: this is a function of rainfall, but with some complicating factors:\n    1) not all rainfall reaches the water body immediately\n    2) not all water in drainage basin reaches the water body; some is lost to evaporation, as well as the two main consumers of water (at least in the United States), power production and agriculture, as well as municipal purposes. \n    \nIn the case of power production, it is important to note that water is only consumed by thermoelectric power plants - i.e. those that require water for cooling. Furthermore, the hotter the water is, the less efficient is the cooling, leading to hotter water coming out of the power plants, which decreases the efficiency of downstream power plants, and increases the total amount of water consumed.\n\nThe amount of water outflow: in some cases this quantity is given, but in the cases of lakes/rivers, must account for evaporation. In the case of rivers, which are defined by their flux, the \"water out\" variable only includes water that leaves the watershed upstream of the point of measurement. In other water bodies, it also includes water that leaves the water body after arriving.\n\nThis leads to a tricky problem: how do we calculate when rainfall reaches a water body? We must take into account\nfluxes of rivers, and the sizes of watersheds. Furthermore, there can be many nonlinearities involved in this calculation. In addition to fluctuations in the amount of water used for agriculture, there will also be nonlinearities introduced by the release and filling of dams, holidays, vacation periods, tourism, music festivals, etc. \n\nFor these reasons, rather than approaching the problem from a physical perspective, we will approach the problem from a machine learning perspective. If we acknowledge the fact that it is very difficult to construct a physical model that will predict water levels accurately, the next best thing we can do is gather data and try to learn from the past in order to predict the future. Indeed, a well-cited study found that\n\n>ANNs \\[Artifical Neural Networks\\] used the initial water level measurements, production well extractions, and climate conditions to predict the final water level elevations 30 d into the future at two monitoring wells. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with the ANNs that quantified the importance of the various input predictor variables on final water level elevations. Unlike traditional physical‐based models, ANNs do not require explicit characterization of the physical system and related physical data. Accordingly, ANN predictions were made on the basis of more easily quantifiable, measured variables, rather than physical model input parameters and conditions. \n> - [A neural network model for predicting aquifer water level elevations](https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.0003.x)\n\nSeveral other studies have had success taking this approach as well: \n\n- [Predicting piezometric water level in dams via artificial neural networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-012-1334-2)\n\n- [Artificial neural network approach to flood forecasting in the River Arno](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248952964_Artificial_neural_network_approach_to_flood_forecasting_in_the_River_Arno)\n\n- [Predicting flood susceptibility using LSTM neural networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346777911_Predicting_flood_susceptibility_using_LSTM_neural_networks)\n\n- [River flood forecasting with a neural network model ](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/1998WR900086)\n\nEach of the nine datasets for which we are making predictions contains some combination of rainfall, temperature, river level, lake level, depth to aquifer, flow rate, and volume of water extracted from the water body.  \n\nIn order to account for non-linearities in the data, we will be using non-linear predictors, in particular XGBRegressor and LSTM Neural Networks.\n\nIn order to capture the effects of the non-linearities, the following feature extraction is proposed: we make dummy variables for every week and month of the year, dummy variables for temperature brackets, and then make cross terms between 1) the time dummy variables and the temperature dummy variables; 2) the time dummy variables and other variables; 3) the temperature dummy variables and other variables. \n\nThe idea behind making these dummy variables is for the machine learning algorithm to learn which variables are most important on the water level on any given day, and how to weigh those variables to predict that water level. We will see in the \"Feature Importances\" sections that this method does in fact capture relationships between the data that would not otherwise be apparent.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Choice of Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe tested a number of different machine learning algorithms to solve this problem: Lasso regression (a type of linear regression where the least important variables are eliminated from the regression), k-Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, XGBRegressor, Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN), and Long-Short-Term-Memory Neural Networks (LSTM). Of these, XGBRegressor and LSTM gave the best results, and so they are the ones we use in this notebook. \n\nLSTM Neural Networks are a type of recurrent neural network which are well suited for predicting sequences of data. For this reason, they are very popular in time-series analysis. However, LSTM networks are not well suited for determining which features are the most important for predicting the target variable(s).

However, the LSTM model only sees this as 365 predictions, since it will predict a sequence of the next 30 days for every one of the 365 days in the test set. The amount of days to predict is very easy to change, it only requires changing one variable as the input to a function. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is also important to explain the feature extraction process. We want to extract as much information from the data as possible. For this reason, we will make extensive use of dummy variables. A dummy variable is used to encode categorical data for machine learning predictions. For example, a dummy variable could be answering the question of whether the temperature is above 25 degrees, with a 1 for yes and a 0 for no. Another example would be a set of dummy variables for every month. This would require 12 new columns, each one representing a month, with the value of that column being 1 if the datapoint is in that month, and 0 if it is not. The purpose of these dummy variables is explained in the introduction, and the process for creating them is copied below:\n\n> In order to capture the effects of the non-linearities, the following feature extraction is proposed: we make dummy variables for every week and month of the year, dummy variables for temperature brackets, and then make cross terms between 1) the time dummy variables and the temperature dummy variables; 2) the time dummy variables and other variables; 3) the temperature dummy variables and other variables. \n\nThe extraction of the dummy variables takes place in `create_temp_and_time_dummies_plus_cross_terms()`, which is called by `feature_engineering()`. The addition of these dummy variables results in dataframes that typically have thousands of features, as opposed to the maximum of 26 in the Auser Aquifer dataset (excluding the date). When we use XGBRegressor to determine the most important features, we add the data from prior rows - for example, we add the data from the prior thirty days - to every row, thus resulting in dataframes that typically have tens of thousands of features. It is this process that allows us to determine which independent variables, from which time periods and temperature brackets, affect which target variables, thus capturing the inherent non-linear dynamics present in the natural environment."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Additionally, it is important to understand the output we will use from XGBRegressor. XGBRegressor is not multi-output compatible - one must use a wrapper, or compute every target variable separately, in order to make multiple predictions. For this reason, we are only able to extract the most important features for predicting a specific day in advance - e.g., predicting the target variable 7 days in advance. Furthermore, because of computational constraints that Kaggle has (there are some problems using the GPU for XGBRegressor, and there are only two CPU cores allocated when using the GPU), we will only present the results from predicting one day. \n\nAlso relevant is the fact that the most important features will vary depending on the time of year. Since we are usually using multiple years of data in our training set, that means that we will be seeing all of the most important features, which might obscure more nuanced observations.\n\nWe will see that XGBRegressor typically finds hundreds of important features out of the tens of thousands it has available. Ideally, we would combine all of the feature importances for all of the days we want to predict, and then simplify the results. Unfortunately, doing all of these computations is not feasible on Kaggle. However, when we tested our XGBRegressor model on a 20 core / 40 thread machine, no call to the `fit()` method ever took longer than a minute, suggesting that this is perfectly feasible with relatively modest resources.

In particular, for a number of predictions we will see a significant lag relative to the actual data. This is due to the fact that when we do our walk-forward validation, we can only update our current model with information from `num_days_to_predict` days ago, since that is when we have all of the real data necessary to train our model; if we trained it on more recent data, our model would have data leakage, meaning that our predictions would not reflect real-life performance. However, if we were allowed to train the model based on, for example, the predictions made yesterday for the following `num_days_to_predict` days (rather than the real values for the following `num_days_to_predict` days), these models would probably become much more accurate. However, this not was not allowed by the competition rules.\n\nNevertheless, most of the predictions are still quite accurate. It is also important to note that experimenting further with batch sizes and epochs, as well as other parameters like the number of layers, filters, and neurons in our LSTM model subtantially improves results, and much can be done to make these predictions even more accurate. The parameters here were chosen as a trade-off between performance and runtime. Additionally, once a model has been trained, one can make predictions with it immediately (as we demonstrate in the last section of this notebook), and it is very easy to update the model with new data. Thus, computational constraints should be viewed through the lens of having a large amount of computing power (as opposed to the computing power available on Kaggle), which only ever has to be used once to train the model, and which can then be deployed and updated quickly and easily afterwards. Multiple cloud providers can train these models for only a few dollars.\n\nAdditionally, since we can easily make predictions using XGBRegressor after training it to find the most important features, we will also display the predictions that XGBRegressor makes. We will see that it is often the case that when LSTM underestimates, XGBRegressor overestimates, and vice versa. In these cases, taking the average of the two would result in highly accurate predictions, which could be a fruitful route to explore. \n\nWe will briefly explain a few important parameters that will be used in the following sections. Explanations of these parameters can also be found in the code comments.\n\n    num_lookback_days - the number of prior days to take into account when trying to make a prediction about future days. When passed as a parameter to feature_engineering(), it will add data from prior days to every row for use with XGBRegressor. When passed as a parameter to run_lstm(), it will be passed as a parameter to the LSTM model, which will automatically look at the data in prior rows, thus eliminating the need for appending the data to every row. \n    \n    num_days_to_predict - the number of days we are trying to predict\n    \n    num_days_difference - if 0, we will predict the actual target values; if 1, we will predict the difference of the target variable between one day and the next; can be set to numbers 2 and higher, but shouldn't be  \n    \n    size_test_set - number of days in the test set\n    \n    synthetic - only for use with the Arno River; number of sets of synthetic data to make\n    \n    batch_size - batch size for the initial training of the LSTM neural network\n    \n    num_epochs - number of epochs to run the initial training\n    \n    num_epochs_walk_forward - if walk_forward is True, the number of epochs to train on the most recently available data; this is a form of walk-forward validation \n    \n    num_train_years_prior - if > 0, the number of this time period's prior years data to train on. For example, if the day is June 15, then we will train on data from June 8 - June 22 of the prior year, of two years prior, ... all the way up to num_train_years_prior. If 0, we will not train on data from prior years. This is a simplified attention mechanism, designed to capture and train on data that is similar from year to year. \n    \n    num_epochs_train_prior_years - if num_train_years_prior > 0, the number of epochs we train on each set of prior years' data\n    \n    scale_y - if True, scale the target variable \n    \n    walk_forward - if True, use walk-forward validation\n    \n    leak_data - if True, train on the most recently available data during walk-forward validation. This is useful for baseline benchmarking purposes, but should otherwise always be set to False because it leaks data\n    \n    rolling_sum - assuming we are predicting the difference between days, then if True, should calculate the actual predictions by taking the rolling sum - see invert_difference() for details \n    \n    print_flags - if True, will print the stage and intermediate dataframes in feature_engineering(), making it clear exactly how the feature extraction is being executed\n\n\n\nThe predictions from both LSTM and XGBRegressor, along with the actual values, will be saved to files, and then loaded when making visualizations. This saves us from needing to re-train an entire model just to make a visualization. Please note that the interactive widget only works when running the notebook - when viewing a static version of the notebook, like on Kaggle, the widget does not appear, and the default prediction that is visualized is 7 days out from the current day. Due to this shortcoming, we also display a small dataframe with the MAE and RMSE for each of the `num_days_to_predict` days.\n\nNote that when first executing a cell that plots results in a Kaggle environment, it is necessary to refresh the output of the working directory in order for the plot to appear.\n\nIn the last section, we demonstrate how to make real-world predictions with both LSTM and XGBRegressor.

Interestingly, we also see that the `Depth_to_Groundwater_LT2` variable in March is important as well, perhaps for predicting values in that same month. Additionally, we also see several values of `Depth_to_Groundwater_SAL` up to 8 days prior to the date from which the prediction is being made (implying 15 days prior to the day that is being predicted) to be very important as well, featuring several times just in the 20 most important features.

For this reason, we won't reduce the lookback period, nor eliminate any of the dummies and cross terms we made in `feature_engineering()`. \n\nLet's take a look at the results of running XGBRegressor on the other two targets.

It should be noted that one can get very low error rates by running this model for a few epochs, without walk-forward validation, on very basic settings. However, this is only because the predictions stay relatively constant over time. Predictions with similar error rates, but that look much more similar to the actual values, can be achieved with more training. This demonstrates that MAE and RMSE do not capture the entire story that the data is telling. This is a particularly hard dataset to predict, but we have seen results more accurate than these, particularly when tuning the number of epochs run, as well as changing the LSTM model that is being used (multiple are given in the LSTM Code section). \n\nWe will demonstrate two sets of predictions with LSTM: the first one will (probably) have lower MAE and RMSE, but will less accurately reflect the shape of the data; the second will (probably) have higher MAE and RMSE, but will more accurately reflect the shape of the data.
