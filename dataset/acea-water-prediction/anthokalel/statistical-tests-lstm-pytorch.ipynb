network LSTM to make our forecasting. It is a non linear model that can allow us to predict next values in function of past values, even farther values in time.\n\nThe $x_t$ is of dimension *features x timestep* and is fed into the LSTM network.\nThen the LSTM compute these values : \n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_t &= \\sigma_g(W_{f} x_t + U_{f} h_{t-1} + b_f) \\\\\ni_t &= \\sigma_g(W_{i} x_t + U_{i} h_{t-1} + b_i) \\\\\no_t &= \\sigma_g(W_{o} x_t + U_{o} h_{t-1} + b_o) \\\\\n\\tilde{c}_t &= \\sigma_c(W_{c} x_t + U_{c} h_{t-1} + b_c) \\\\\nc_t &= f_t \\circ c_{t-1} + i_t \\circ \\tilde{c}_t \\\\\nh_t &= o_t \\circ \\sigma_h(c_t)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n\n* Batch size : 32, it means $x_t$ is fed into the network 32 times before the back propagation algorithm.\n* Epochs : sometimes 20, sometimes, it depends on the data.\n* Loss : MSE Loss (for regression)\n* Optimizer : Adam Optimizer\n\nAdvantages : \n* Non Linear model ;\n* Many parameters ;in \\mathbb{N}$\n* LSTM handle better vanishing and exploding gradients than RNN ;\n* Can memorize previous precious informations in the previous step.\n\nInconvenience : \n* It is a black box model, it's difficult to see and visualize why the model made this prediction and on which features it is based on.\n\n<a id=\"section_three_2\"></a>\n#### Feature importance\n\nFortunately, I have found a paper on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-importance-with-time-series-and-recurrent-neural-network-27346d500b9c) where the author found a simple way to describe how NN made their prediction thanks to derivative importance. \n\nGiven $f$ the function representative of our model, $y_t$ the output and $(x_{t-1}^1, ..., x_{t-p}^m)$ the input variables where $p = 30$ (time steps), $m$ is the number of input features, $W$ the weights, the model can bé written in the following way : \n$y_t = f(x_{t-1}^1, ..., x_{t-p}^m, W)$\n\nMathematically, the derivative measures the sensivity to change of the function $f$ value with respect to its argument $x$. \n\nThe intuition in the derivative importance is to compute this derivative $f$ w.r.t. to model inputs \n\n<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{t-p}^1 & \\cdots &  x_{t-p}^m\\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n x_{t-1}^1 & \\cdots &  x_{t-1}^m \n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nSo for each $x_t$ feeded into the LSTM network, you can compute the matrix :\n\n<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\dfrac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial x_{t-p}^1} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial x_{t-p}^m}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial x_{t-1}^1} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial x_{t-1}^m} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{t-p}^1} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{t-p}^m}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{t-1}^1} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{t-1}^m} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n    \nIt gives us how much the input values have an influence on the output of our model.\n\nThen, we make a mean over the time step dimension ($p$) and again a mean when all the inputs have been feeded into the network to get the derivative importance and so : feature importance.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MTS_RNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size=8, hidden_layer_size=20,

Some of them have peaks and trend, which can be diffcult sometimes to forecast but the model detect them and forecast them.\nDerivative importance gives us good informations about how the LSTM make the forecast according to inputs. This technique is very useful when we deal with neural networks which are black boxes and we don't know how the neural network make their prediction. \n\nThanks for having read this notebook, I hope you enjoyed and maybe have learned new things on water behaviour in nature !\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
