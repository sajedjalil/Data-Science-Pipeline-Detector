Read the Problem Statement and understand the requirements carefully.\n2. READ THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND REQUIREMENTS AGAIN.\n3. Look carefully at the Data and do EDA (It will help largely during feature engineering and Inference). It is worth the time.\n4. Decide the problem category (Classification/Regression).\n5. Spit data into Kfolds before doing Feature engineering. Because it's very easy to leak data/contaminate the validation set during Feature Engineering. Then the validation set is no longer representative of real data.\n6. Build Basic model and record the performance.\n7. Try to improve the performance by Feature engineering, better encoding, synthetic feature creation etc.\n8. Do feature selection to only use the important/relevant features.\n9. If that saturates or starts to drop, go back and try using other models and see whichone works better.\n10. Tune the hyperparameters for the models which seem to work good as per your observations.\n11. Select some of the best models from previous step and do an ensemble/stacking-blending.\n12. Submit to the leaderboard and gaze the difference in CV and LB. If it is huge, then most likely there was some overfitting and leakage across folds. Try to identify and rectify the same.\n13. When done, resubmit and you should see a close result.\n14. Not satisfied with result/Trying to get better rank? Head over to the Discussion Forum and read through interesting discussions and see what others are trying to do. If happy, implement them and gradually start improving your scores and skills.\n\n**Happy Kaggling!**\n\n# Why this Competition?\nThis competition provides an unique oppertunity for Data Science beginners to participate in a Hackathon style challenge. It also provides the unique oppertunities for beginners to get their hands dirty and indulge is practical application of ML and do one of the basic tasks machine learning algorithms are capable of doing:- **Classification**.  \n\nThis competition has the right mix to Catergorical and Numerical features we might expect in a practical problem and this helps us know how to leverage both of thhem in conjugation for a Classification task.\n\n# Problem Statement\nThe goal of this competition is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competition will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition.  \n\nThe dataset is used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset (in this case, the actual Titanic data!) and generated using a CTGAN.  \n\nSo we are sort of dealing with a variation of actual real-world data and here as Data Scientists are expected to predict the Binary Classification based on these features.\n\n## Data Description:-\nThere are 6 categorical features and 4 continuous features in the dataset. The label binary class.  \n\n`survival` : Survival  \n`pclass` : Ticket class  \n`sex` : Sex  \n`Age` : Age in years  \n`sibsp` : # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic  \n`parch` : # of parents / children aboard the Titanic  \n`ticket` : Ticket number  \n`fare` : Passenger fare  \n`cabin` : Cabin number  \n`embarked` : Port of Embarkation\n\n## Expected Outcome:-\n* Build a model to predict if a person survived this tragic incident or not, given the information above.\n* Grading Metric: **Accuracy**\n\n## Problem Category:-\nFrom the data and objective its is evident that this is a **Binary Classification Problem** in the **Tabular Data** format.\n\nSo without further ado, let's now start with some basic imports to take us through this journey:-","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Asthetics\nimport warnings\nimport
