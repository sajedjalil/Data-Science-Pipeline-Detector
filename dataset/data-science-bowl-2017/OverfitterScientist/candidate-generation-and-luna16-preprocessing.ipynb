I will also provide links of useful resources and information.\n\nThe script is written in Python. I recommend people to install anaconda on their desktop because of its advantages mentioned [here][1]. The libraries that will be used in this tutorial for reading, processing and visualisation of data are matplotlib, numpy, skimage and [pydicom][2]. \n\nThe images are of size (z, 512, 512) where z is the number of slices in the CT Scan and varies depending on the resolution of the scanner. Such large images cant be fed directly into a Convolution Network architectures because of the limit on the computation power. Thus we will have to find the regions that are more probable of having cancer. We will be reducing our search space by first segmenting the lungs and then removing the low intensity regions. \n\nIn this tutorial, we will first start with reading the dataset and visualising it. After that, we will be segmenting the lung structures and then find the region of interest(possible cancer regions) in the CT Scans using Image processing methods. Then I will talk about how to preprocess LUNA16 dataset for training architectures like UNet for segmentation and candidate classification.\n\nThe segmentation of lung structures is very challenging problem because homogeneity is not present in the lung region, similar densities in the pulmonary structures, different scanners and scanning protocols. The segmented lungs can be further used to find the lung nodule candidates and regions of interest which may help in better classification of the CT Scans. Finding the lung nodule regions is a very hard problem because there are nodules that are attached to the blood vessels or are present at the boundary of the lung region. The lung nodule candidates can be further used for classification by cutting 3D voxels around them and passing it through a 3D CNNs which can be trained on LUNA16 dataset. The LUNA 16 dataset has the location of the nodules in each CT Scan thus will be useful for training the classifier. \n\n  [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3t23vv/what_advantages_are_there_of_using_anaconda/\n  [2]: http://pydicom.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ceec3ade-181c-4059-e0f2-958a1f7629af"},"source":"**Reading a CT Scan**\n-----------------\nThe input folder has three things, one is the sample_images folders which has the sample CT Scans.

CNN architectures like UNet can also be used to generate candidate regions of interest. \n\nThere are also a lot of good papers on Lung Segmentation and Nodule Candidate generation using Image Processing methods. I am posting the methods with a little summary of all of them:\n\n 1. [Automatic segmentation of lung nodules with growing neural gas and support vector machine][1]- The proposed method consists of the acquisition of computerized tomography images of the lung, the reduction of the volume of interest through techniques for the extraction of the thorax, extraction of the lung, and reconstruction of the original shape of the parenchyma. After that, growing neural gas (GNG) is applied to constrain even more the structures that are denser than the pulmonary parenchyma (nodules, blood vessels, bronchi, etc.). The next stage is the separation of the structures resembling lung nodules from other structures, such as vessels and bronchi. Finally, the structures are classified as either nodule or non-nodule, through shape and texture measurements together with support vector machine.\n 2. [Automated Segmentation of Lung Regions using Morphological Operators in CT scan][2]- The `get_segmented_lungs` method is a little modification of this paper. The threshold of 604 was taken from this paper.\n 3. [Pre-processing methods for nodule detection in lung CT][3]- This paper has used dot enhancement\nfilter applied to the 3D matrix of voxel data. This 3D filter attempts to determine local geometrical characteristics for each voxel, computing the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix and evaluating a  \"likelihood\" function that was purposely built to discriminate between local morphology of linear, planar and spherical objects, modeled as having 3D Gaussian sections (Q. Li, S. Sone and K. Doi [6]). By applying this 3D filter to artificial images, we have verified the efficiency in detecting the Gaussian-like regions even in the cases were they are superimposed to non-Gaussian ones.\n 4. [Lung Nodule Detection using a Neural Classifier][4]: This paper discusses a dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier for false-positive finding reduction. The  performance is evaluated as a fully automated computerized method for the detection of lung nodules in screening CT in the identification of lung cancers that may be missed during visual interpretation. \n\nNext I will be discussing about preprocessing of the LUNA16 dataset and using it to train the UNet model.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482512001412\n  [2]: http://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?Automated-Segmentation-of-Lung-Regions-using-Morphological-Operators-in-CT-scan.pdf\n  [3]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0507153.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.ijetch.org/papers/136-D058.pdf"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a8dc2219-4d30-4dac-9460-80bab1216182"},"source":"UNET for Candidate Point Generation\n-----------------------------------\n\nNowadays, Deep Learning methods are achieving good results in Segmentation problems in medical imaging.

Thus we need a classifier to classify the candidates as either Nodule or Non-Nodule.  This is also referred to as False Positive Reduction step.  I am sharing a list of useful resources with a summary of all of them:\n\n 1. [Pulmonary Nodule Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks][1]: They use a CNN to predict\nwhether the image contains a pulmonary lesion. As baselines, they also look at using SVM, kNN, and logistic regression to perform the same task. LIDC dataset is used for training and the classification results are very good.\n 2. [Pulmonary Nodule Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Computed Tomography Images][2]: They design a deep convolutional neural networks method for nodule classification, which has an advantage of autolearning representation and strong generalization ability. A specified network structure for nodule images is proposed to solve the recognition of three types of nodules, that is, solid, semisolid, and ground glass opacity (GGO). Deep convolutional neural networks are trained by 62,492 regions-of-interest (ROIs) samples including 40,772 nodules and 21,720 nonnodules from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) database. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of sensitivity and overall accuracy and that it consistently outperforms the competing methods.\n 3. [Deep Learning for the Classification of Lung Nodules][3]: They have trained a CNN and tested the results on different datasets.  In order to understand the features of lung nodules, they further construct new datasets, based on the combination of artificial geometric nodules and some transformations of the original images, as well as a stochastic nodule shape model.\n 4. [Lung Nodule Classification Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks][4]: In this work, they present a method for classifying lung nodules based on CNNs. Training is performed by balancing the mini-batches on each stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iteration to address the lack of nodule samples compared to background samples. They show that the method outperforms a base feature-engineering method using the same techniques for other stages of lung nodule detection, and show that CNNs obtain competitive results.\n\n\n  [1]: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports2016/324_Report.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2016/6215085/\n  [3]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06651\n  [4]: http://www.liv.ic.unicamp.br/~juliomb/resources/2016-lnc-ciarp.pdf"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"767f1baa-b704-148c-5eb5-c8416f3fa01f"},"source":"Due to computational limitations the size of each cannot very large too.
