I ended up changing the order of operations so that I could efficiently remove the extra space around the lungs. I also made some changes to the functions that were causing me errors (like setting background values to -1 and accounting for files with missing slice thickness).\n\nThe order of preprocessing operations is:\n 1. load data\n 2. segment image with fill\n 3. dilate the segmented image to create a mask\n 4. mask the original image with the segmented one\n 5. use the segmentation to trim away the excess of the masked image\n 6. resize the image to 60x100x120 (lower resolution must still preserve nodules!)\n 7. save resized 3D image to .npy file"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0a046719-f57f-fa0f-19f3-acac26ebe7f8"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport dicom\nimport os\nimport scipy.ndimage\n#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom joblib import Parallel, delayed\nimport multiprocessing\n\nnum_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n\nfrom skimage import measure, morphology\n\n# Initialize constants\nMAIN_DIR = '.../DSB2017/'\nINPUT_FOLDER = MAIN_DIR + 'stage1/'\npatients = os.listdir(INPUT_FOLDER)\npatients.sort()\nnpat = len(patients)\n# for some odd reason there are duplicate files for each folder.
