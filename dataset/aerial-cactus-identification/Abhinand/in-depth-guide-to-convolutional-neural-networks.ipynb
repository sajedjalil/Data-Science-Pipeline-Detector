We'll be using PyTorch for this tutorial. PyTorch is a powerful deep learning framework which is rising in popularity, and it is thoroughly at home in Python which makes it really easy to learn and use. This tutorial won’t assume much in regards to prior knowledge of PyTorch, but it might be helpful to checkout [my previous introductory CV tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinand05/mnist-introduction-to-computervision-with-pytorch). \n\n\n![FeaturedImage](https://i.ibb.co/ws3htpn/2088474-6a86-3.jpg)\n\n\n\nIn this notebook, we'll train a CNN to classify images based on whether they have a columnar cactus or not. We'll use the Aerial Cactus Dataset from [this currently running Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/overview). For more information about the dataset visit [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/data). I picked this competition because I felt it is the best place for beginners to practice their new found skills with CNNs as MNIST is just way too simple to bring CNNs into play, a regular Multi-layer perceptron may well do the job. So, this is a perfect beginners competition as someone rightly said in the discussion forums. \n\n### **If you like this kernel or wish to fork it please give it an UPVOTE to show your appreciation.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir('../input/'))\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n\n# OpenCV Image Library\nimport cv2\n\n# Import PyTorch\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import SubsetRandomSampler\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader, Dataset\nimport torchvision\nimport torch.optim as optim","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading Training Data + EDA"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")\ntrain_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The train data contains 17500 images which can be found in a seperate directory also we have a csv file but we can't directly visualize them as we'll see later.\n\nThe test data has 4000 images and it is stored in a seperate directory.

It turns out that they're nowhere near good enough to achieve similar results on complex datasets mainly because they expect a flattened vector of the original image like the one below. MNIST dataset is an exception as it comes already well processed.\n\n![Example](https://github.com/abhinand5/CNNs-in-PyTorch/blob/master/cifar-cnn/FireShot%20Capture%20084%20-%20Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning%20with%20PyTorch%20-%20Udacity%20-%20classroom.udacity.com.png?raw=true)\n\nSo all it sees is a vector and treats it just as a vector with no special structure. It has no knowledge whatsoever of the fact that it was previously arranged in a grid, losing important information. If we do the same for color images we throw away vital information by flattening it, which almost never works for real-world images. CNNs on the other hand work exactly the other way around, capable of working with and elucidating patterns from multi-dimensional data, that is why they are so powerful. Unlike MLPs CNNs actually understand the information from pixels that are in close proximity to each other and are more related to each other than those pixels that are far apart and unrelated. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Understanding CNNs\n\nConolutional Neural Networks make use of three different classes of layers which distinctly differ with each other. But when combined they give extraordinary results. \n\n* Convolutional Layers\n* Pooling Layers\n* Fully Connected Layers\n\nWe'll go over each one of there layers in great detail. \n\nI'll use an example of classifying a car here to explain different layers of a Convolutional Neural Network.\n\n![Layers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b1070e4_screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-2.59.36-pm/screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-2.59.36-pm.png)\n\n**Convolutional Layer:**\n\nTurns out that in order to understand Convolutional layer first we have to understand a concept called Filters. Expecially high-pass filters. \n\nTo detect changes in intensity in an image, we'll be using and creating specific image filters that look at groups of pixels and react to alternating patterns of dark/light pixels. These filters produce an output that shows edges of objects and differing textures. \n\nFor this we first contstruct a filter according to a size called window size, which is nothing but a matrix like this.\n\nHere in an example gif.\n\n![Example](https://media.giphy.com/media/jrzu0JxxZydz0valeu/giphy.gif)\n\nThese windows are usually of size 3x3 which helps CNNs identify the patterns in an image. These filters can be modified to get different filters as output. There may be several filters in a Convolutional layer.\n\nThe convolutional layer is produced by applying a series of many different image filters, also known as convolutional kernels, to an input image.\n\n![Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b10723a_screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-3.06.07-pm/screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-3.06.07-pm.png)\n\nIn the example shown, 4 different filters produce 4 differently filtered output images. When we stack these images, we form a complete convolutional layer with a depth of 4!\n\n![Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b10729b_screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-3.07.03-pm/screen-shot-2018-05-31-at-3.07.03-pm.png)\n\nThe depth of each consecutive convolutional layers may increase resulting in the networks capturing some incredibly complex features/patterns from the images. In fact this is very much similar to how our brains interpret images in an instant. \n\n**Pooling Layer:**\n\nPooling is used in Convolutional Neural Networks to make the detection of certain features somewhat invariant to scale and orientation changes. Another way of thinking about what pooling does is that it generalizes over lower level, more complex information.\n\nHow it is done is a window of fixed size of made to stroll over the image and inside the window a specific value according to a metric is calculated an a new tensor is formed. When we take the maximum element from the window it is known as Max-Pooling which is the most common pooling technique. There is also average pooling which you may see out on the wild. Here is an illustration which you might find helpful. There are also alternatives to Pooling, like Capsule Networks which is out of the score of this kernel. \n\nHere in an example gif of Max Pooling.\n\n![Example](https://media.giphy.com/media/U7PsR7cv9oIcB6eEAd/giphy.gif)\n\nWhen we combine pooling layers with convolutional layers, we reduce the dimension of the layers which helps in computation but more than that it picks the pixel values of higher significance. So our model so far looks something like this...\n\n![Example](https://i.ibb.co/V06mcY0/Intro-to-Deep-Learning-with-Py-Torch-Udacity-classroom-udacity-com.png)\n\n**Fully Connected Layers:**\n\nFully connected layers are no different from the ones you already know from MLPs. It is the final piece of the puzzle that makes it special and powerful. An even more refined form is passed on to FC layers to make the final prediction.\n\nHere comes our final model...\n\n![Example](http://cs231n.github.io/assets/cnn/convnet.jpeg)\n\n\nI know this may not be the best of definitions you would see for CNNs but the goal here is to make it atleast vaguely understandable. There is much more happening behind the scenes which I skipped. I encourage you to go out and explore on your own to find those awesome stuff. Hope it made sense to you. Let's move on.\n\n### **If you like this kernel or wish to fork it please give it an UPVOTE to show your appreciation.**\n\nImage Credits: Stanford CS231n, Udacity"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Define the Network Architecture\n\nHere comes the important part of defining a CNN which will can done using the `torch.nn` module . First, you must define a Model class and fill in two functions `__init__` and `__forward__`. Now that you understand how a CNN works everything is pretty much self-explanatory. Read the docs for `nn.Conv2d` to know more about the parameters. \n\n* We define the convolutional layers first. Details can be mostly interpreted from the comment lines itself. But let me just explain one. Our image (RGB) has 3 channels so depth=3, that's why our first conv layer has 3 incoming channels, I've decided to have 16 filters for the first conv layer so out_channels=16 as it produces 16 different filters, the kernel size aka window size is set to 3 with padding=1 which makes up extra spaces on the edges of the image to help the 3x3 kernel slide over all the edge pixels of the image in case of size mismatch. \n\n* We then go on and define the pooling layers where a window size and stride of 2 is set. Exactly same as the example gif you saw previously. \n\n* The outputs are then connected to a FC layer.\n\n* Dropout is a regularization technique to avoid overfitting, which is also added. Everything is  put together in a forward propagation function later. \n\n* You might also want to use Batch Normalization but I decided not to because I achieved more than 99% accuracy without it.\n\n* The outputs here don't need to be 0 or 1, what Kaggle expects is the probabilities so we don't need an activation function like sigmoid on the output layer."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class CNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(CNN, self).__init__()\n        # Convolutional Layer (sees 32x32x3 image tensor) \n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n        # Convolutional Layer (sees 16x16x16 image tensor)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)\n        # Convolutional Layer (sees 8x8x32 image tensor)\n        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, padding=1)\n        # Convolutional Layer (sees 4*4*64 image tensor)\n        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3, padding=1)\n        # Maxpooling Layer\n        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)\n        # Linear Fully-Connected Layer 1 (sees 2*2*128 image tensor)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128*2*2, 512)\n        # Linear FC Layer 2\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 2)\n        # Set Dropout\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # add sequence of convolutional and max pooling layers\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv3(x)))\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv4(x)))\n        # flatten image input\n        x = x.view(-1, 128 * 2 * 2)\n        # add dropout layer\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        # add 1st hidden layer, with relu activation function\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        # add dropout layer\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        # add 2nd hidden layer, with relu activation function\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        return x","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check if CUDA is available\ntrain_on_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()\n\nif not train_on_gpu:\n    print('CUDA is not available.
