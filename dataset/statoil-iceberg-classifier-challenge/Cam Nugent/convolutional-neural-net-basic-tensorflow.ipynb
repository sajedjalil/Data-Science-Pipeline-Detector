I am sharing the code here in the hopes that other people can learn a bit and maybe be tempted into experiment with using tensorflow themselves!\n\nNOTE: This solution abandons the non-image data in the train and test json files so it is definitely far from an optimal solution. This network is not designed to win the competition, but rather with the idea of me learning more about neural network design through the use of base tensorflow.\n\nNOTE2: The model scores in the 0.27 range if the n_epochs=250 line is changed to n_epochs=2500. Expanding the number of neurons and adding connected layers also further improves the score.\n\nNOTE3: The kernel ran over time... so I made the change in NOTE2 on the master so no one else has to worry about that!\n\n## Imports\nRelitavely short list of libraries and imports, making use of pandas, numpy, the train/test split function from SciKit-Learn and obviously tensorflow.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"b29004616894b0edd6bfcad97744e7ea27b608ac","_cell_guid":"c0cfc83c-29ee-4673-b2fd-ee77aaadd35c"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"8d8ffc194d3352e15cfffecbbcc257525e8c740c","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"1450a423-d442-4adf-96f2-2878f1d0d33c"},"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"### Citations\n\nHere is a list of the resorces that went in to helping me design this convolutional neural network:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers\n\nhttps://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/convolutional_network.py\n\nThis example is using TensorFlow layers API\nTensorFlow’s high-level machine learning API (tf.estimator) makes it easy to configure, \ntrain, and evaluate a variety of machine learning models:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator\n\nI also read this book.

The None is so that the # of rows is flexiable, the 75,75 is the pixel dimensions of the image and the 2 is because there are two channels of image data being passed in. Note y has shape=(None) because it will be a 1-D vector with one input for each row. If we had multiple classes this could be changed to shape=(None, 5) (for 5 classes).\n\nI use the tensorflow layers API because it is easier to understand the makeup of the network and also easier to design the network.\n\nThe network used here uses an initial set of convolutional layers, followed by a pooling step and several additional fully connected layers.
