An example is a point on the Earth representing the location of the Eiffel Tower, or a point on Mars representing the location of its highest mountain, [Olympus Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons). Most consumers use the term when referring to hotels, campsites, fuel stations or any other categories used in modern automotive navigation systems. Users of a mobile device can be provided with geolocation and time aware POI service that recommends geolocations nearby and with a temporal relevance (e.g. POI to special services in a ski resort are available only in winter). The notion of POI is widely used in cartography, especially in electronic variants including GIS, and GPS navigation software.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Problem of POI Matching\n\nIt is useful to combine POI data obtained from multiple sources for effective reusability. One issue in merging such data is that different dataset may have variations in POI name, address, and other identifying information for the same POI. It is thus important to identify observations which refer to the same POI. The process of POI matching involves finding POI pairs that refer to the same real-world entity, which is the core issue in geospatial data integration and is perhaps the most technically difficult part of multi-source POI fusion. The raw location data can contain noise, unstructured information, and incomplete or inaccurate attributes, which makes the task even more difficult. Nonetheless, to maintain the highest level of accuracy, the data must be matched and duplicate POIs must be identified and merged with timely updates from multiple sources. A combination of machine-learning algorithms and rigorous human validation methods are optimal for effective de-duplication of such data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About Foursquare\n\n[Foursquare Labs Inc.](https://foursquare.com/), commonly known as Foursquare, is an American location technology company and data cloud platform.

It was developed by [Grove Karl Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Karl_Gilbert) in 1884 as his *ratio of verification (v)* and now is frequently referred to as the *Critical Success Index* in meteorology. It was later developed independently by [Paul Jaccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jaccard), originally giving the French name *coefficient de communauté* and independently formulated again by T. T. Tanimoto. Thus, the *Tanimoto index* or *Tanimoto coefficient* are also used in some fields. However, they are identical in generally taking the ratio of Intersection over Union. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:\n\n$$ J(A, B) := \\frac{\\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert A \\cup B \\right\\vert} = \\frac{\\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert A \\right\\vert + \\left\\vert B \\right\\vert - \\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}. $$\n\nNote that by design, $0\\leq J\\left(A, B\\right)\\leq 1$. If $A$ and $B$ are both empty, define $J(A, B) = 1$. The Jaccard coefficient is widely used in computer science, ecology, genomics, and other sciences, where binary or binarized data are used. Both the exact solution and approximation methods are available for hypothesis testing with the Jaccard coefficient. See [this paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3118-5) ([arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11372)) for details.\n\nLet us assume that for a specific `id` $a$, our algorithm produces three matches $a$, $b$ and $c$ whereas the true matches are $a$, $b$, $d$ and $e$. Then the Jaccard index for the prediction on this particular `id` will be\n\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c\\right\\} \\cap \\left\\{a, b, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{a, b, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert} = \\frac{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b\\right\\} \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert} = \\frac{2}{5}. $$\n\nThus, while correct matching predictions are rewarded, incorrect matching predictions are penalised by equal measure. The evaluation metric is simply the mean of Jaccard indices for each of the test observations, i.e. if the test data comprises $n_{\\text{test}}$ observations and $J_i$ denotes the Jaccard index corresponding to the $i$th test observation, $i = 1,2,\\cdots,n_{\\text{test}}$, then the final metric by which a model will be evaluated is:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{test}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{test}}} J_i. $$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

This observation is consistent with the histograms of the numerical features in the univariate analysis. However, there are some finer details to check in the violinplots for the following features:\n- `dist_loc` for different classes of `match_country`, `match_state`, `match_city`, `match_zip`: There is a general dependence between the two features as `dist_loc` should be less in the situations where `match_country == True` than the situations where `match_country == False`. However, this does not hold in general as it is always possible that two POIs are located at the extremely opposite regions on the same country, and also that two POIs are located at nearby regions of two neighbor countries. Similar pattern is reflected in the violinplots of `dist_loc` for different classes of `match_state`, `match_city` and `match_zip`. Interestingly, the pattern does not replicate for `dist_loc` and `match_categories`.\n- `dist_name` for different classes of `match_country`, `match_state`, `match_city`, `match_zip`, `match_categories`: Though not as extreme as the cases with `dist_loc`, we observe that `dist_name` is more likely to be $0$ in the situations where the attributes `match_country`, `match_state`, `match_city`, `match_zip`, `match_categories` are *true*, than the situations where the same are *false*.\n- `dist_url` and `match_country`: The violinplot for `dist_url` is far less concentrated around $0$ if `match_country == False`, than `match_country == True`. However, the same pattern cannot be seen when `dist_url` is plotted against `match_state`, `match_city` or `match_zip`.\n- `dist_phone` and `match_country`: The distributions of `dist_phone` for `match_country == True` and `match_country == False` show considerable difference in concentration about $0$ and presence of outliers, however the distribution of `dist_phone` seems to be more or less unaffected by the status of `match_state`, `match_city`, `match_zip` and `match_categories`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Acknowledgements\n\n- [Foursquare - Location Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching) competition","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n\n- [Correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)\n- [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)\n- [Foursquare City Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_City_Guide)\n- [Foursquare Labs Inc.](https://foursquare.com/)\n- [Foursquare Swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_Swarm)\n- [Grove Karl Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Karl_Gilbert)\n- [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)\n- [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\n- [Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity test and estimation methods for biological presence-absence data](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3118-5)\n- [Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity test and estimation methods (arxiv version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11372)\n- [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)\n- [List of U.S. state and territory abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_abbreviations)\n- [Olympus Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons)\n- [Paul Jaccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jaccard)\n- [Point of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest)\n- [Vladimir Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Levenshtein)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Runtime and memory usage\nstop = time.time()\nprint(pd.Series({\"Process runtime\": \"{:.2f} seconds\".format(float(stop - start)),\n                 \"Process memory usage\": \"{:.2f} MB\".format(float(process.memory_info()[0]/(1024*1024)))}).to_string())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-22T15:55:19.170218Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-22T15:55:19.170717Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-22T15:55:19.179786Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-22T15:55:19.17067Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-22T15:55:19.179025Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
