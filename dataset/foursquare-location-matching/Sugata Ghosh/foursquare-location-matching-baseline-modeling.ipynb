An example is a point on the Earth representing the location of the Eiffel Tower, or a point on Mars representing the location of its highest mountain, [Olympus Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons). Most consumers use the term when referring to hotels, campsites, fuel stations or any other categories used in modern automotive navigation systems. Users of a mobile device can be provided with geolocation and time aware POI service that recommends geolocations nearby and with a temporal relevance (e.g. POI to special services in a ski resort are available only in winter). The notion of POI is widely used in cartography, especially in electronic variants including GIS, and GPS navigation software.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Problem of POI Matching\n\nIt is useful to combine POI data obtained from multiple sources for effective reusability. One issue in merging such data is that different dataset may have variations in POI name, address, and other identifying information for the same POI. It is thus important to identify observations which refer to the same POI. The process of POI matching involves finding POI pairs that refer to the same real-world entity, which is the core issue in geospatial data integration and is perhaps the most technically difficult part of multi-source POI fusion. The raw location data can contain noise, unstructured information, and incomplete or inaccurate attributes, which makes the task even more difficult. Nonetheless, to maintain the highest level of accuracy, the data must be matched and duplicate POIs must be identified and merged with timely updates from multiple sources. A combination of machine-learning algorithms and rigorous human validation methods are optimal for effective de-duplication of such data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About Foursquare\n\n[Foursquare Labs Inc.](https://foursquare.com/), commonly known as Foursquare, is an American location technology company and data cloud platform.

It was developed by [Grove Karl Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Karl_Gilbert) in 1884 as his *ratio of verification (v)* and now is frequently referred to as the *Critical Success Index* in meteorology. It was later developed independently by [Paul Jaccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jaccard), originally giving the French name *coefficient de communauté* and independently formulated again by T. T. Tanimoto. Thus, the *Tanimoto index* or *Tanimoto coefficient* are also used in some fields. However, they are identical in generally taking the ratio of Intersection over Union. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:\n\n$$ J(A, B) := \\frac{\\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert A \\cup B \\right\\vert} = \\frac{\\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert A \\right\\vert + \\left\\vert B \\right\\vert - \\left\\vert A \\cap B \\right\\vert}. $$\n\nNote that by design, $0\\leq J\\left(A, B\\right)\\leq 1$. If $A$ and $B$ are both empty, define $J(A, B) = 1$. The Jaccard coefficient is widely used in computer science, ecology, genomics, and other sciences, where binary or binarized data are used. Both the exact solution and approximation methods are available for hypothesis testing with the Jaccard coefficient. See [this paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3118-5) ([arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11372)) for details.\n\nLet us assume that for a specific `id` $a$, our algorithm produces three matches $a$, $b$ and $c$ whereas the true matches are $a$, $b$, $d$ and $e$. Then the Jaccard index for the prediction on this particular `id` will be\n\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c\\right\\} \\cap \\left\\{a, b, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{a, b, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert} = \\frac{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b\\right\\} \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert \\left\\{a, b, c, d, e\\right\\} \\right\\vert} = \\frac{2}{5}. $$\n\nThus, while correct matching predictions are rewarded, incorrect matching predictions are penalised by equal measure. The evaluation metric is simply the mean of Jaccard indices for each of the test observations, i.e. if the test data comprises $n_{\\text{test}}$ observations and $J_i$ denotes the Jaccard index corresponding to the $i$th test observation, $i = 1,2,\\cdots,n_{\\text{test}}$, then the final metric by which a model will be evaluated is:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{test}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{test}}} J_i. $$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Note:** In this notebook, we shall rely solely on the provided pairs set `data_pairs` to build the baseline models.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

It is likely that in both `df_train` and `df_test`, `dist_loc` is positively skewed to an extreme degree. To elaborate, [Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) quantifies the asymmetry of a distribution about its mean. It is given by\n\n$$ g_1 := \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(x_i-\\bar{x}\\right)^3}{\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(x_i-\\bar{x}\\right)^2\\right]^{3/2}}, $$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the observations, given by $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. The measure $g_1$ can be negative, zero, positive. A value close to $0$ suggests that the distribution is more or less symmetric. However, as it deviates from $0$, it becomes more and more skewed (either positively or negatively). A positive skewness indicates that the distribution is concentrated towards the left side, with the longer tail being on the right side. A negative skewness indicates that the distribution is concentrated towards the right side, with the longer tail being on the left side.
