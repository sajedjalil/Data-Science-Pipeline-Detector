Some questions, for example related to how the dataset was developed, are answered by the host on the forums. I'll collect those questions and answers along with links to the forum posts.\n\nI'm personally excited about this competition because I can see the real life application, and I hope to learn some tabular data techniques I'm not so familiar with.

Are Personally Identifiable Information respected?\n\n**Answer by host:**\nThis dataset is intended to provide information pertaining to real business sites/points of interest and originates from three primary sources:\n* User generated – In countries where Foursquare apps are available, user-generated content is collected and subject to an internal validation process prior to inclusion in the Places dataset.\n* Partner contributions – This content comes from trusted partners that, for example, may work with small businesses that want to share data in order to promote their business.\n* Publicly available sources – This content is aggregated from multiple open web sources containing publicly available information with a commercial or points of interest focus.\n\nThe dataset we use in this competition is derived from user generated content, partner contributions, and publicly available sources. It pertains to real business sites and points of interest. However, for purposes of this competition, we have materially altered the competition dataset with additional noise, modifications, and artificial information, which we had initially characterized as simulated and synthetic to avoid the expectation from users that the data was necessarily associated with real businesses.\n\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/319722) [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q4\"></a>\n## How was the \"pairs.csv\" file created?\n\n**Question by @ymatioun:** can you tell us how the file \"pairs.csv\" was created?\n\n**Answer by host:** This is a good question. All matching and non-matching pairs in pairs.csv come from the information in train.csv; there is no additional information in pairs.csv that does not exist in the train.csv file. Matches are pairs of places with the same point_of_interest ids, non-matches are samples of places with different point_of_interest ids. pairs.csv contains samples of matching and non-matching pairs with the purpose to help model training, and it is far from inclusive of all combinations that can be generated from train.csv. You may choose to use pairs.csv as is, modify it (remove matching and non-matching pairs or add new ones generated from train.csv), or disregard it completely, depending on your training strategy.\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q5\"></a>\n## Do places in the train and test data overlap?\n\n**Question by @kaggledummie007:** \n\n**Answer by host:** The places in the train and test data do not overlap, you only need to find matches within the test data.\n\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q6\"></a>\n## How are these categories generated and are the categories of train and test the same distribution?\n\n**Question by @columbia2131:** How are these categories generated? For example, is the system such that the store can select multiple choices from those that already exist? And, are the categories of train and test the same distribution?\n\n**Answer by host:** In this competition we assume that the data may be coming from different sources, different providers. Each provider can follow different taxonomies for categories, or even allow free text. That is, some providers may follow a hierarchical schema with different levels of granularity (e.g., \"retail store\" > \"clothes and shoes store\" > \"clothes store\" > \"large-size clothes store\"), or a flattened schema (e.g. \"shopping\"). In practice, this means that the categories entries are not expected to follow a single taxonomy of normalized mutually exclusive values, but rather a mix of taxonomies and different levels of the taxonomy used. For the above example, even if two matching places are generated following the same taxonomy, their categories may be entered in different levels of the hierarchy: one place as \"clothes store\" and the other as \"large-size clothes store\"). Sometimes the taxonomies may be the same or very similar to encourage a simple one-hot vector encoding, but this is not always the case.\n\nOn your second question, there is no assumption that the category attributes in the train and test sets follow the same distributions. In addition, there can be category values in the test set that do not exist in the train set, and vice versa.\n\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q7\"></a>\n## What is the goal of this competition?\n\n**Question by @atulverma:** I wanted to understand the relevance of this dataset and competition to Foursquare in real life context.\n\n**Answer by host:** The main focus of this competition is to raise awareness on the data science community on one of the most challenging problems we work on at Foursquare. As Foursquare currently maintains a first party database of 100M+ POIs around the globe, and ingests an increasing amount of POI information from multiple sources on a daily basis, performing data matching and entity resolution at scale becomes a significantly complicated problem.\n\nThe dataset we compiled for this competition is a synthetic dataset with the purpose to expose and simulate several of the real-life challenges we face at Foursquare: e.g., POIs with missing information; attributes in multiple languages; and unnormalized, noisy, or inaccurate data, to name but a few. As it is a synthetic dataset, Foursquare does not benefit from the submitted answers, or any processing applied in the data. Our purpose is to provide a dataset and problem definition as realistic as possible to engage the community and offer a glimpse on the interesting and challenging problems we work on on a daily basis.\n\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q8\"></a>\n## How to think about point_of_interest?\n\n**Question by @damoonshahhosseini:** Is there a way to map POI column in train.csv to actual Ids?\n\n**Answer by host:** You can think of the point_of_interest column as the cluster id of matching entries (each entry having a unique id) that are clustered together. Matching entries (identified by their id) can be considered as different \"views\" of a certain point_of_interest. Borrowing from the example above, the two entries with ids E_2958d43cf14986 and E_4af978d225f361 refer both to the same point_of_interest P_34ba86726c3c59.\n\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/318967)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"q9\"></a>\n## Are there errors in the dataset?\n\n**Question by @telduzar:** I noticed that some of the pairings there are not right and doesn't make sense...\n\n**Answer by host:** Matching records can in many cases share attributes (like geographical coordinates) with the exact same or very similar values, which facilitates their matching. However, in real-life conditions, it is not uncommon that the amount of noise in the attributes of the records varies vastly depending on the source of information and can be as significant as even manual annotation is hard. Geographical coordinates are a characteristic example where the values provided by different sources can suffer from noise for multiple reasons (e.g., GNSS signal degradation, rounding errors, bad parsing). In this competition, we added different levels of noise in the records in an effort to simulate the challenges of a real-life scenario.\n\nI hope that clarifies the scope of the competition and offers some context on the noise in the records.\n\n[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/discussion/323968)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# BONUS: Relevant Papers\n\n- [Deep Learning for Blocking in Entity Matching: A Design Space Exploration](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2459-thirumuruganathan.pdf) (shared by @hidehisaarai1213)\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
