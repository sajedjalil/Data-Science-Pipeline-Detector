I'm seeing it as a sandbox, and as a way to go indepth through the whole data science process. I am getting help from the ressources below :\n* https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions\n* https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\n* https://www.kaggle.com/zlatankr/titanic-random-forest-82-78\n\n**Edit**: This kernel is a work in progress. Feel free to contribute or ask questions in the comment section, I will be happy to answer. :-)\n\n## **<div id=\"I\">I. Define the problem</div>**\n\n### **<div id=\"I1\">1. Problem description</div>**\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nHere, we are trying to to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we are going to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\nThis is a classification problem.\n\n### **<div id=\"I2\">2. Methodology</div>**\n\nThe methodology involved in this machine learning problem go through multiple stages :\n\n* **1. Define the Problem**: If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\n* **2. Gather the Data**: John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \"dirty data\" to \"clean data.\"\n* **3. Prepare Data for Consumption**: This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\n* **4. Perform Exploratory Analysis**: Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\n* **5. Model Data**: Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n* **6. Validate and Implement Data Model**: After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset.\n* **7. Optimize and Strategize**: This is the \"bionic man\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\" rate.\n\n### **<div id=\"I3\">3.

Wrangle, cleanse and Prepare Data for Consumption</div>**\n\nWe have collected several assumptions and decisions regarding our datasets and solution requirements. So far we did not have to change a single feature or value to arrive at these. Let us now execute our decisions and assumptions for correcting, creating, and completing goals.\n\n### **<div id=\"IV0\">0. The 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting</div>**\n\nIn this stage, we will clean our data by 1) correcting aberrant values and outliers, 2) completing missing information, 3) creating new features for analysis, and 4) converting fields to the correct format for calculations and presentation.\n\n* **Correcting**: Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs. In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be necessary to create an accurate model.\n* **Completing**: There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and embarked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how-to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values. Thus, it's important to fix before we start modeling, because we will compare and contrast several models. There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it truly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria; like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. There are more complex methodologies, however before deploying, it should be compared to the base model to determine if complexity truly adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed with the median, the cabin attribute will be dropped, and embark will be imputed with mode. Subsequent model iterations may modify this decision to determine if it improves the model’s accuracy.\n* **Creating**: Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a title feature to determine if it played a role in survival.\n* **Converting**: Last, but certainly not least, we'll deal with formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. For this dataset, we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables.\n\n### **<div id=\"IV1\">1. Dropping features</div>**\n\nThis is a good starting goal to execute. By dropping features we are dealing with fewer data points. Speeds up our notebook and eases the analysis.\n\nBased on our assumptions and decisions we want to drop the Cabin, PassengerId and Ticket features.\n\n**Edit**: We are not dropping *Cabin* and *Ticket* anymore, since we want ot get information about these features."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a8a1491c13c372b3efd2b590a90a44a220aace04","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"column_choice_training = training_df[['Pclass','Sex','Age','SibSp','Parch','Ticket','Fare','Cabin','Embarked','Name','Survived']]\ncolumn_choice_test = testing_df[['Pclass','Sex','Age','SibSp','Parch','Ticket','Fare','Cabin','Embarked','Name']]\ncolumn_choice_training.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad8d2ac007f7758048e9f4e0fa49e3d8bd10e3ef"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **<div id=\"IV2\">2.

The target is to have a data set for testing the model in the training phase and then provide insight on how the specific model adapts to an independent data set. A round of cross-validation comprises the partitioning of data into complementary subsets, then performing analysis on one subset. After this, the analysis is validated on other subsets (testing sets). To reduce variability, many rounds of cross-validation are performed using many different partitions and then an average of the results are taken. **Cross-validation is a powerful technique in the estimation of model performance technique.**\n\nHere, we are using the ShuffleSplit function from Scikit Learn. ShuffleSplit will randomly sample your entire dataset during each iteration to generate a training set and a test set. The test_size and train_size parameters control how large the test and training test set should be for each iteration. Since you are sampling from the entire dataset during each iteration, values selected during one iteration, could be selected again during another iteration.  \n\nThe main difference between ShuffleSplit and K-Fold is that In KFold, during each round you will use one fold as the test set and all the remaining folds as your training set. However, in ShuffleSplit, during each round n you should only use the training and test set from iteration n. **As your data set grows, cross validation time increases, making shufflesplits a more attractive alternate**. If you can train your algorithm, with a certain percentage of your data as opposed to using all k-1 folds, ShuffleSplit is an attractive option."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cd3448938c70e87d9a0bb421e69e4420ac0c7909","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"models = [\n    LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'), \n    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, oob_score = True, random_state = 1)\n    ]\n\nmodel_results = pd.DataFrame(data = {'test_score_mean': [], 'fit_time_mean': []})\n\n# Spliting the model\ncross_validation_split = model_selection.ShuffleSplit(n_splits = 10, test_size = .3, train_size = .6, random_state = 0 )\n# Performing shufflesplit cross validation, with the whole training set (the cross_validate function coupled with ShuffleSplit take care of spliting the training set) \nfor model in models:\n    cross_validation_results = model_selection.cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv= cross_validation_split, return_train_score=True)\n    # Checking the mean of test scores for each iteration of the validation\n    model_results = model_results.append({'test_score_mean' : cross_validation_results['test_score'].mean(), \n                                      'fit_time_mean' : cross_validation_results['fit_time'].mean()}, ignore_index=True) \n \nmodel_results","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1e268f4f013046cdcef91c9084f4a6b048cdce21"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **b. Tune Model with Hyper-Parameters**\n\nIn machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. By contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via training.\n\nDifferent model training algorithms require different hyperparameters, some simple algorithms (such as ordinary least squares regression) require none. Given these hyperparameters, the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data. Model hyperparameters are set manually and are used in processes to help estimate model parameters.\n**Tuning an hyperparameter means trying to get the closest possible to its best value, in order to maximize the accuracy of the model** (for larger dataset, time computing may also be taken into account for parameter tuning).\n\nFirst, we are using **RandomizedSearchCV**. We need to create a parameter grid to sample from during fitting. On each iteration, the algorithm will choose a difference combination of the features.

Evaluate Model Performance</div>**\n\nLet's recap, with some basic data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning algorithms (MLA), we are able to predict passenger survival with ~80% accuracy. Not bad for a few lines of code. But the question we always ask is, can we do better and more importantly get an ROI (return on investment) for our time invested? For example, if we're only going to increase our accuracy by 1/10th of a percent, is it really worth 3-months of development. If you work in research maybe the answer is yes, but if you work in business mostly the answer is no. So, keep that in mind when improving your model.\n\n#### **Determine a Baseline Accuracy**\n\nBefore we decide how-to make our model better, let's determine if our model is even worth keeping. To do that, we have to go back to the basics of data science 101. We know this is a binary problem, because there are only two possible outcomes; passengers survived or died. So, think of it like a coin flip problem. If you have a fair coin and you guessed heads or tail, then you have a 50-50 chance of guessing correct. So, let's set 50% as the worst model performance; because anything lower than that, then why do I need you when I can just flip a coin?\n\nOkay, so with no information about the dataset, we can always get 50% with a binary problem. But we have information about the dataset, so we should be able to do better. We know that 1,502/2,224 or 67.5% of people died. Therefore, if we just predict the most frequent occurrence, that 100% of people died, then we would be right 67.5% of the time. So, let's set 68% as bad model performance, because again, anything lower than that, then why do I need you, when I can just predict using the most frequent occurrence.\n\n#### ** How-to Create Your Own Model**\n\nOur accuracy is increasing, but can we do better? Are there any signals in our data? To illustrate this, we're going to build our own decision tree model, because it is the easiest to conceptualize and requires simple addition and multiplication calculations. When creating a decision tree, you want to ask questions that segment your target response, placing the survived/1 and dead/0 into homogeneous subgroups.\n\nRemember, the name of the game is to create subgroups using a decision tree model to get survived/1 in one bucket and dead/0 in another bucket. Our rule of thumb will be the majority rules. Meaning, if the majority or 50% or more survived, then everybody in our subgroup survived/1, but if 50% or less survived then if everybody in our subgroup died/0. Also, we will stop if the subgroup is less than 10 and/or our model accuracy plateaus or decreases.\n\n**Question 1**: Were you on the Titanic? If Yes, then majority (62%) died. Note our sample survival is different than our population of 68%. Nonetheless, if we assumed everybody died, our sample accuracy is 62%.\n\n**Question 2**: Are you male or female? Male, majority (81%) died. Female, majority (74%) survived. Giving us an accuracy of 79%.\n\n**Question 3A (going down the female branch with count = 314)**: Are you in class 1, 2, or 3? Class 1, majority (97%) survived and Class 2, majority (92%) survived. Since the dead subgroup is less than 10, we will stop going down this branch. Class 3, is even at a 50-50 split. No new information to improve our model is gained.\n\n**Question 4A (going down the female class 3 branch with count = 144)**: Did you embark from port C, Q, or S? We gain a little information. C and Q, the majority still survived, so no change. Also, the dead subgroup is less than 10, so we will stop. S, the majority (63%) died. So, we will change females, class 3, embarked S from assuming they survived, to assuming they died. Our model accuracy increases to 81%.\n\n**Question 5A (going down the female class 3 embarked S branch with count = 88)**: So far, it looks like we made good decisions. Adding another level does not seem to gain much more information. This subgroup 55 died and 33 survived, since majority died we need to find a signal to identify the 33 or a subgroup to change them from dead to survived and improve our model accuracy. We can play with our features. One I found was fare 0-8, majority survived. It's a small sample size 11-9, but one often used in statistics. We slightly improve our accuracy, but not much to move us past 82%. So, we'll stop here.\n\n**Question 3B (going down the male branch with count = 577)**: Going back to question 2, we know the majority of males died. So, we are looking for a feature that identifies a subgroup that majority survived. Surprisingly, class or even embarked didn't matter like it did for females, but title does and gets us to 82%. Guess and checking other features, none seem to push us past 82%. So, we'll stop here for now.\n\nWith very little information, we get to 82% accuracy. On a worst, bad, good, better, and best scale, we'll set 82% to good, since it's a simple model that yields us decent results. But the question still remains, can we do better than our handmade model? This leads us to the next section."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6ba98434b82063c50f0eab2c391082c6b95a6895"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **<div id=\"V4\">4. Tune Model with Feature Selection</div>**\n\nAs stated in the beginning, more predictor variables do not make a better model, but the right predictors do. So another step in data modeling is feature selection.\n\nFeature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for four reasons:\n\n* simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users,\n* shorter training times,\n* to avoid the curse of dimensionality,\n* enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting (formally, reduction of variance)\n\n**The central premise when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains some features that are either redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information**. Redundant and irrelevant are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"71fde9b6e6888bdaa1e112ff91c5418344c5a9d9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **<div id=\"VI\">VI.
