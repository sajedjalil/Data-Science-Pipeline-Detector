In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\n\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \n\n\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed","_uuid":"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f","_cell_guid":"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0","_uuid":"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737","_cell_guid":"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3","_uuid":"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -
