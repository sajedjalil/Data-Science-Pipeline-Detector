It is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a $p$-dimensional vector (a list of $p$ numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a $(p-1)$-dimensional hyperplane.\n\nWhen data are not labeled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The clustering algorithm which provides an improvement to the support vector machines is called **support vector clustering** and is often used in industrial applications either when data are not labeled or when only some data are labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass.\n\nIn the below code, [SVC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html) stands for Support Vector Classification."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d13b0dbd-df95-4d88-9472-ace2467cdff5","_uuid":"e87de37a054831cbb12e6606dbaa4a965ce2300a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = SVC()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_svc = clf.predict(X_test)\nacc_svc = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (\"Train Accuracy: \" + str(acc_svc) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"784567c8-ecdb-4ce1-950c-7e131eaa54ae","_uuid":"3a761d16c6293104723624111be94a4f3ede840d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3) Linear SVM\n\nLinear SVM is a SVM model with linear kernel.<br>\nIn the below code, [LinearSVC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html) stands for Linear Support Vector Classification."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8cc5193c-3021-4c24-9527-816b695081fc","_uuid":"5445353ecd9c48fd21928ded1fcf7e2a1b7d6106","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = LinearSVC()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_linear_svc = clf.predict(X_test)\nacc_linear_svc = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (\"Train Accuracy: \" + str(acc_linear_svc) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c801115a-e960-443b-a148-24380f359da7","_uuid":"d228198cb82b4855b5dab0c0eed5eb41f6d66d02"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4) $k$-Nearest Neighbors\n\n[$k$-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and is used for classification and regression.

For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.\n\nNaive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. It is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8febef02-a1ab-4b40-9cc5-7767df03d281","_uuid":"5075f02f520ad56f78c1f396fe0eec9b7fc00730","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = GaussianNB()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_gnb = clf.predict(X_test)\nacc_gnb = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (\"Train Accuracy: \" + str(acc_gnb) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e6136623-8028-409a-b239-6f92c719c2aa","_uuid":"5a40f4e4ff45cf2bf4d9cb19f094acd44d18fc9e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 8) Perceptron\n\n[Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"661dc020-72c4-467d-aaff-388e375b4c7b","_uuid":"ac62f3486a6e8e27fa10642e70dee88b75100c1d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = Perceptron(max_iter=5, tol=None)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_perceptron = clf.predict(X_test)\nacc_perceptron = round(clf.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (\"Train Accuracy: \" + str(acc_perceptron) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"86c776a1-2842-4aae-b907-301bff298d43","_uuid":"1e8ca383bcccda9343a05579f6079a67a2589e7d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 9) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n\n[Stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) (often shortened in **SGD**), also known as incremental gradient descent, is a stochastic approximation of the gradient descent optimization method for minimizing an objective function that is written as a sum of differentiable functions.

Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa). The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes (i.e. commonly mislabelling one as another).\n\nIn predictive analytics, a table of confusion (sometimes also called a confusion matrix), is a table with two rows and two columns that reports the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. This allows more detailed analysis than mere proportion of correct classifications (accuracy). Accuracy is not a reliable metric for the real performance of a classifier, because it will yield misleading results if the data set is unbalanced (that is, when the numbers of observations in different classes vary greatly). For example, if there were 95 cats and only 5 dogs in the data set, a particular classifier might classify all the observations as cats. The overall accuracy would be 95%, but in more detail the classifier would have a 100% recognition rate for the cat class but a 0% recognition rate for the dog class.\n\nHere's another guide explaining [Confusion Matrix with example](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/).\n\n$\\begin{matrix} & Predicted Positive & Predicted Negative \\\\ Actual Positive & TP & FN \\\\ Actual Negative & FP & TN \\end{matrix}$\n\n\nIn this (Titanic problem) case: \n\n>**True Positive:** The classifier predicted *Survived* **and** the passenger actually *`Survived`*. <br>\n>**True Negative:** The classifier predicted *Not Survived* **and** the passenger actually *`Not Survived`*.<br>\n>**False Postiive:** The classifier predicted *Survived* **but** the passenger actually *`Not Survived`*.<br>\n>**False Negative:** The classifier predicted *Not Survived* **but** the passenger actually *`Survived`*.<br>"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"04e2db54-b0ba-4c85-8c50-62cc7acaa248","_uuid":"8658592f1d6034b06f66008c54546e86d7817954"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> In the example code below, we plot a confusion matrix for the prediction of ***`Random Forest Classifier`*** on our training dataset.
