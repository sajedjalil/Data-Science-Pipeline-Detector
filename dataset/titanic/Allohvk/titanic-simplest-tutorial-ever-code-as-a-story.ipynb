It has actually gone low. Shows that our model badly overfitted the training data. Overfitting is somewhat similar to taking an oversmart decision. The model has applied too much brains when probably there was no need for it to. It used the train_data to come up with some really complicated model. This model fits the training data well (overfits it as a matter of fact) but when applied to data outside, it begins to fall apart. Titanic is a simple data set. The model should have kept things simple. We will help it keep things simple by cutting down the number of features.

The machines learn the rules themselves.\n\nWhen Arthur Samuel defined ML in 1959 as as the “a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”, little did he know that a few decades later, it takes just 1 line of code to understand exactly what he meant.\n\nSee the decision tree image to understand how the machine made up the rules. Ignore the gini business for now. Let us look at the rest of the data. It is very much similar to the 10 question game we played as kids. For now let us not worry about HOW the model is built. Let us assume that the model building is done and look at what happemns when a new observation comes in...say a 'male' and he belongs to 3rd class. Let us see how the model now decides whether he survives or not survives. \n\nStart from the top node. There are 891 samples reaching this decision point (basically the entire training set). The 'value' is nothing but the label. 549 expired and 342 survived out of these 891. Now let us see the condition itself - Is Sex_boolen<=0.5? No it is male and sex=1. True is left and False is right so we move to the below level to the node to the right. \n\nIn next node, we have 577 samples which corresponds to the 577 males in the dataset. Out of this 468 expired and 109 survived. The question at this decision point is: Is Pclass<=1.5. Since our man's Pclass is =3 so it moves below to the node on the right side. There it checks for Pclass<=2.5  and then moves to the last level on the right. There are 347 samples here which means in the training data set there are 347 rows which contain Pclass=3 and Sex=Male. Now check the value column. It shows [300, 47]. This means out of 347 people, 300 expired and 47 survive. This is a leaf node. There is nowhere else to go to. So the model has to give a decision now. What decision do you think it will give? Obviously at this node 300 expire and 47 survive out of 347. Naturally the model or any rational being would assume that if somebody reaches this node it is more likely that he will expire. So the answer returned by model is 'Expire'. But you do know that there are 47 people who survive. They will be predicted WRONGLY by the model. There is nothing you can do about it..other than improving the model or trying a new model. In fact this gini business is all about giving an idea of 'by how much the model could be wrong' at that node. It is like an 'error' factor. There is a simple formula for it but we will not bother about that right now\n\nNow do the same for a Pclass1 female. You will get SURVIVED. You end up on the left bottom most node (leaf). The samples there is 94. This means there are 94 females who travelled in Pclass 1. The value field shows that 3 expire and 91 survive. Naturally the node predicts 'Survival'. Look at the gini value here. As we discussed it is a simple measure of error. What do you think it should be - high or low? Obviously the possibility of error here is very very low. So the gini is .062 compared to the previous flow (Pclass3 Male) where gini was .234.\n\nThis explains the whole magical genie business. It is nothing but a measure of the error at that node. Another way to look at it is to say that it is a (inverse) measure of confidence of the model at that node. \n\nScikit uses a binary decision tree called CART. In other words, every level has only 2 decisions - Yes or No. if a sample satisfies the condition, then it goes to the LEFT branch (if exists), otherwise it goes RIGHT\n\nFor a model to be good, the ginis have to be as low as possible. Let us quickly see how the model tries to keep the gini low. When creating the first node, the model tries to analyse all features.  In this case we have only 2 features - Sex and Pclass. The model takes each feature individually, calculates the Gini for every possible split in that feature and then selects the feature/split which leads to lowest Gini score. Between Sex and Pclass which do you think will have a better Gini score? If we split by Sex, and predict that females live and males die, we will not be widely off the mark right? The gini would be decent here. Now instead of Sex, let us consider Pclass. If we blindly say Pclass 1 survives and Pclass2,3 expires, we may not get a very high gini score. This is because there are fair number of females in Pclass 2,3 who survive. Even if we predict that Pclass 1,2 survive and all Pclass 3 expire, the gini is still lower than the earlier case (the one with Sex feature where we assume all males die and females live). So the model chooses the feature and the split that MAKES MOST SENSE and in this case it is Sex - m or f. This is the first level. \n\nNow the model moves on to the second level. Obviously there is only one feature left - Pclass. But what should be the binary split that will yield the best gini? Interestingly the answer is different in case of males and females. In case of females that split is Pclass3 versus Pclass 1,2. In case of males it is Pclass 1 versus Pclass2,3. This is a clever model because Pclass 2 females almost always survive (like Pclass 1 females) and Pclass 2 males have expiry rates similar to Pclass 3 males.\n\nThe way the tree is contructed is not too different from the way we construct our questions when we played the 10 question game as kids. The first question should be the one from which we glean the max information possible, then the next question and so on..\n\nAbove is a simple intuitive explanation of a decision tree and gives a feel of how an ML model generates code from data. You may not have the luxury of seeing this type of inner working for every model. But hopefully this gives you an idea of how any model works. There is an error function and the model works to minimize this error function. Another thing both man and machine try to minimize (esp in these times) is Cost. So this error minimization is more popularly called Cost minimization or 'Cost function' and there are several interesting ways to do it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##Scikit allows you to print the rules to see what is happening\nfrom sklearn.tree.export import export_text\n\ntree_rules = export_text(model, feature_names=['Pclass', 'Sex_boolean'])\nprint(tree_rules)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that if you have an older version of Scikit, the above graphs/trees may not be generated and you can try graphviz as below to generate the decision tree\n\n- from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\n- from subprocess import check_call\n- from IPython.display import Image\n- from sklearn import tree\n\ntree.export_graphviz(model,out_file='TitanicDT.dot', feature_names = ['Pclass', 'Sex_boolean'], class_names = ['Expired', 'Survived'], rounded = True, filled= True )\n\nThis needs the graphviz on your local machine.
