So to fill in the\nmissing age data we will use the title of the person, and fill in the median age for the given title.\n\nIt is important to understand that someone with title **Master** is typically a young boy who will be\nconsidered a child. **Master** was used address politely a boy who was too young to be called **Mister**.\nAlso, a **Miss** is typically unmarried and younger than a **Mrs**, so hopefully the strategy will help\nus get good values for the missing ages.\n\nSo the first step will be to make an additional column with the *Title*, in all three dataframes.

We have the\npassenger class, the sex, the age, #siblings_and_spouses, and #childern_and_parents, the embarkment port\nand the fare. We've also extracted a *Title* from the name column. However, I think we can gain some more.\nLet's consider the cabin first.\n### Engineering a cabin feature\nImportant to note: The way to survive is to get onboard a lifeboat. At the RMS Titanic there were\n20 lifeboats, however only 18 were used. There were less capacity of the lifeboats than the number of\npassengers and crew onboard. Numbers from wikipedia says there was a capacity of 1178 passengers in the\nlifeboats. There were 2224 on board (crew included). Since there was not enough capacity of the lifeboats\nto evacuate everyone, the \"Women and children first\" policy were applied. \n\n#### A side note on the low capacity of the lifeboats\nWe may think today that it was really strange to have less capacity of lifeboats than number of\npassengers and crew. However, the number of lifeboats was well within the maritime laws and regulations\nof the time. The next question that then comes up is: Why was the maritime regulation not requiring\nany liner to have lifeboat capacity for every passenger and crew member? The answer to this is that\nthere never were any concern that all passengers had to be evacuated over a relatively short period of\ntime. A ship in distress would probably stay afloat for many hours. First of all there was a lot of\nmaritime traffic of those days, and a liner in distress would always be able to call for assistance\nfrom a nearby vessel and evacuate the personnel to that vessel. The vessels were equipped with\nwireless telegraphs. That was the common philosophy of the time, and that was the reason why\nthis was not considered a problem. After all, Titanc was the ship that could not sink. It was called\nthe ship that could not sink due to the double bottom and the watertight bulkheads. However the\nbulkheads was not sealed with a ceiling, so when each bulkhead was filled with water, the water\nsimply flooded over to the next bulkhead. She was hence not so unsinkable after all.\n\n#### A feature for the cabin side\nThis is indeed a bit interesting. The \"Women and children first\" policy was indeed enforced differently on\nthe port and starboard side of the ship, so the side of the cabin could be a useful predictor in our\nanalysis. Cabin numbers ending with an odd number indicates that the cabin was on starboard side, while\ncabins ending on an even number were located on the port side. Let's create a feature called\n**CabinSide** that takes the values **unknown**, **starboard** or **port**."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"729ff2da-9098-4032-8a1f-c5e27177c105"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Let's look at the cabin a bit.

Note that is\nshould not be necessary to have two features, with one **Sex_male** and another **Sex_female**, as\nthat will just make to directly linear correlated values.
