Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters.\nThough there were about 2,224 passengers and crew members, we are given data of about 1,300 passengers. Out of these 1,300 passengers details, about 9000 data is used for training purpose and remaining 400 is used for test purpose. In this competition we are given about 400 test data with missing survived column and we have to use different machine learning algorithms to predict whether the passengers in the test data survived or not.\nBoth training and test data arenot clean(contains lots of missing values), so main goal of this competition is to clean the data and build the model with best accuracy.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.050846,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:02.834646","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:02.7838","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Understanding the data\n\n\n\nSurvival : 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n\nPclass : A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower\n\nsibsp : The # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister Spouse = \n\nhusband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)\n\nparch : The # of parents / children aboard the Titanic Parent = mother, father Child = daughter, son, \nstepdaughter, stepson Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n\nTicket : Ticket number\n\nFare : Passenger fare\n\nCabin : Cabin number embarked\n\nPort of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\n\nName, Sex , Age are self-explanatory\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.049198,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:02.933443","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:02.884245","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing all necessary libraries\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.049276,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:03.033009","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:02.983733","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport warnings\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":1.226869,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.310316","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:03.083447","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-03T02:05:26.75617Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-03T02:05:26.756891Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.632153Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-03T02:05:26.756746Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.631118Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load the data","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.052078,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.412984","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.360906","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":" \ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/test.csv')","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.08669,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.549512","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.462822","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.633726Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.634074Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.66491Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.634043Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.663846Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analyze both training and testing data to get better understanding of the data\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.050882,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.650334","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.599452","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# to print first five rows of train data\ntrain_data.head()","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.083585,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.783765","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.70018","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.666583Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.66694Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.699753Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.666908Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.698673Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# to print first five rows of test data\ntest_data.head()","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.07513,"end_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.912543","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-24T09:48:04.837413","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.701313Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.701637Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.718975Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.701597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-03T02:05:27.717971Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n#### We can see that total number of columns in test data is one less than that in train data.
