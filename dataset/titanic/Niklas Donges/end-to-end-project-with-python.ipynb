Like you can already see from it’s name, it creates a forest and makes it somehow random. The „forest“ it builds, is an ensemble of Decision Trees, most of the time trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.\n\nTo say it in simple words: Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.\n\nOne big advantage of random forest is, that it can be used for both classification and regression problems, which form the majority of current machine learning systems.  With a few exceptions a random-forest classifier has all the hyperparameters of a decision-tree classifier and also all the hyperparameters of a bagging classifier, to control the ensemble itself. \n\nThe random-forest algorithm brings extra randomness into the model, when it is growing the trees. Instead of searching for the best feature while splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. This process creates a wide diversity, which generally results in a better model. Therefore when you are growing a tree in random forest, only a random subset of the features is considered for splitting a node. You can even make trees more random, by using random thresholds on top of it, for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like a normal decision tree does).\n\nBelow you can see how a random forest would look like with two trees:\n\n![picture](https://img3.picload.org/image/dagpgdpw/bildschirmfoto-2018-02-06-um-1.png)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"050023e6-c1f7-491e-a807-3498f10dcaf6","_uuid":"b767c42df201580f6154d032d300078efac7f051"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature Importance\n\nAnother great quality of random forest is that  they make it very easy to measure the relative importance of each feature.

It computes this score automaticall for each feature after training and scales the results  so that the sum of all importances is equal to 1.

This project had a heavy focus on the data preparation part, since this is what data scientists work on most of their time. \n\nI started with the data exploration where I got a feeling for the dataset, checked about missing data and learned which features are important. During this process I used seaborn and matplotlib to do the visualizations. During the data preprocessing part, I computed missing values, converted features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created a few new features. Afterwards I started training 8 different machine learning models, picked one of them (random forest) and applied cross validation on it. Then I explained how random forest works, took a look at the importance it assigns to the different features and tuned it's performace through optimizing it's hyperparameter values.  Lastly I took a look at it's confusion matrix and computed the models precision, recall and f-score, before submitting my predictions on the test-set to the Kaggle leaderboard.\n\nBelow you can see a before and after picture of the train_df dataframe:\n\n![Titanic](https://img1.picload.org/image/dagldoor/before_after.png)\n\n\nOf course there is still room for improvement, like doing a more extensive feature engineering, by comparing and plotting the features against each other and identifying and removing the noisy features. Another thing that can improve the overall result on the kaggle leaderboard would be a more extensive hyperparameter tuning on several machine learning models. Of course you could also do some ensemble learning."}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","nbconvert_exporter":"python"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
