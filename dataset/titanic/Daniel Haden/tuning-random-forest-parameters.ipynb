Below I plot the score vs. parameter value graphs for six variables.  From this plot, I can estimate a reasonable range for each parameter to try in `GridSearchCV`.  This method will cut down on the time calculating optimum parameters.  Of course, the downside is that the optimum parameters may still very well fall outside of these ranges."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"eae77a8b-a799-ec25-c0c4-6e8b9f05d9d1"},"outputs":[],"source":"# function takes a RF parameter and a ranger and produces a plot and dataframe of CV scores for parameter values\ndef evaluate_param(parameter, num_range, index):\n    grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid = {parameter: num_range})\n    grid_search.fit(X_train[features], y_train)\n    \n    df = {}\n    for i, score in enumerate(grid_search.grid_scores_):\n        df[score[0][parameter]] = score[1]\n       \n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(df, orient='index')\n    df.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True)\n    df = df.sort_values(by='index')\n \n    plt.subplot(3,2,index)\n    plot = plt.plot(df['index'], df[0])\n    plt.title(parameter)\n    return plot, df"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"793c210e-4a5c-e54a-c6f7-1dea8a805950"},"outputs":[],"source":"# parameters and ranges to plot\nparam_grid = {\"n_estimators\": np.arange(2, 300, 2),\n              \"max_depth\": np.arange(1, 28, 1),\n              \"min_samples_split\": np.arange(1,150,1),\n              \"min_samples_leaf\": np.arange(1,60,1),\n              \"max_leaf_nodes\": np.arange(2,60,1),\n              \"min_weight_fraction_leaf\": np.arange(0.1,0.4, 0.1)}"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b644a49b-be4a-e5b5-1cf1-1ec8976071fc"},"outputs":[],"source":"index = 1\nplt.figure(figsize=(16,12))\nfor parameter, param_range in dict.items(param_grid):   \n    evaluate_param(parameter, param_range, index)\n    index += 1"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"80740d14-8084-6fd3-1cfc-38865f96a1e7"},"source":"I can narrow the parameters for `GridSearchCV` using the plots above.
