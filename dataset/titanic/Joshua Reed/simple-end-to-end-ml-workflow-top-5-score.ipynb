In this kernel, I will be working with the very famous Titanic dataset. It provides information on the fate of each passenger on board the vessel when it tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Inclusive in the file is further passenger information including age, sex, ticket type and cabin. The challenge set by Kaggle using this dataset is to build a predictive model that can determine whether or not an individual would have survived the 1912 tragedy.\n\nThis kernel is ideally pitched at relative beginners to Data Science & Machine Learning, who already have a grasp of the key concepts and a typical workflow and are now interested in learning some further (simple) tools and tricks in order to yield a strong competition score. At the time of submission, this kernel obtained a score (0.818) that pitched me within the top 5% of the leaderboard. It's now currently flitting between the top 5%/6%. \n\nPlease ask any questions that you have on my code or approach, or suggestions if you think any part could be done better - I am always looking to improve! And if you found this kernel helpful, i'd very much like to hear it :). OK, the last thing to now say is: Enjoy the read!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"88b23c89c6d574a967adf5ae323a8ac584e9301d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

In order to gain a smooth out representation of the full dataset, K fold cross validation can be applied. It works in the following way: \n\nRandomly split your entire dataset into k 'folds'. \n- For each k folds in your dataset, build your model on k – 1 folds of the data set. Then, test the model to check the effectiveness for kth fold. \n- Record the error you see on each of the predictions. \n- Repeat this until each of the k folds has served as the test set. \n\nThe average of your k recorded errors is called the cross-validation error and will serve as your performance metric for the model.

This is essentially what Hyperparamter tuning is - finding the best parameters for your model. The best way to achieve this, while computationally expensive, is to use a GridSearchCV. \n\nGridSearchCV is an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator, in order to find the values for optimum model performance. Each model has its own parameter's, so the Grid Search needs to be specific for each model. Below, I will complete a GridSearchCV for each model, specifying search ranges for each model's most important parameters, in order to find the one's that yield the highest accuracy score for the Titanic train set. \n\nFYI, if you're forking this kernel, it will take a while to run. I've kept my GridSearch relatively light touch in all, but expect to wait around 30 minutes from start to finish.\n\nMore information on each model's parameter's can be found online. If you're also wondering how I arrived at suitable ranges for each parameter, I used a combination of Google, past experience and trial and error.

A Voting Classifier can then be used to wrap your models and average the predictions of the sub-models when asked to make predictions for new data.\n\nThere are two types of Voting Classifier, hard or soft. I saw a very simple explanation on a Q&A forum which i'll share with you now to explain the difference in approach:\n\n- Suppose you have probabilities: 0.45 0.45 0.90\n- The hard voting would give you a score of 1/3 (1 vote in favour and 2 against), so it would classify as a \"negative\".\n- Soft voting would give you the average of the probabilities, which is 0.6, and would be a \"positive\".\n\nThe code below completes both a hard and soft voting classifier on all 11 models, minus the Gaussian Naive Bayes which, due to it's poorer score, I will omit from this final step. I will then compare the scores of either classifier, before selecting the best to proceed with making final predictions."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"11fecd4d14ec5423d4f118fd7b73843895e3a4c4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Hard Vote or majority rules w/Tuned Hyperparameters\ngrid_hard = VotingClassifier(estimators = [('Random Forest', ran), \n                                           ('Logistic Regression', log),\n                                           ('XGBoost', xgb),\n                                           ('Gradient Boosting', gbc),\n                                           ('Extra Trees', ext),\n                                           ('AdaBoost', ada),\n                                           ('Gaussian Process', gpc),\n                                           ('SVC', svc),\n                                           ('K Nearest Neighbour', knn),\n                                           ('Bagging Classifier', bag)], voting = 'hard')\n\ngrid_hard_cv = model_selection.cross_validate(grid_hard, X_train, y_train, cv = 10)\ngrid_hard.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(\"Hard voting on train set score mean: {:.2f}\". format(grid_hard_cv['train_score'].mean()*100)) \nprint(\"Hard voting on test set score mean: {:.2f}\". format(grid_hard_cv['test_score'].mean()*100))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"deeb10efe2943369380ab8b886ad95881bc7109d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid_soft = VotingClassifier(estimators = [('Random Forest', ran), \n                                           ('Logistic Regression', log),\n                                           ('XGBoost', xgb),\n                                           ('Gradient Boosting', gbc),\n                                           ('Extra Trees', ext),\n                                           ('AdaBoost', ada),\n                                           ('Gaussian Process', gpc),\n                                           ('SVC', svc),\n                                           ('K Nearest Neighbour', knn),\n                                           ('Bagging Classifier', bag)], voting = 'soft')\n\ngrid_soft_cv = model_selection.cross_validate(grid_soft, X_train, y_train, cv = 10)\ngrid_soft.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(\"Soft voting on train set score mean: {:.2f}\". format(grid_soft_cv['train_score'].mean()*100)) \nprint(\"Soft voting on test set score mean: {:.2f}\". format(grid_soft_cv['test_score'].mean()*100))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9988888a7d7200bd797ce9000f12a54b3371467c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well it was pretty close, but for the test set the soft voting classifier came out just on top, so I will proceed to use this as my final model for prediction and submission.

Some thoughts on how I could do this include:\n\n- Exploring new features in the data\n- Using a predictive model to impute age, rather than a simple groupby operation\n- Investing more time in parameter tuning and model optimisation\n- Prioritising fewer models and thus cutting more redundant features\n- Exploring deep learning application\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning, I would love to hear your feedback on my work, including what you found helpful or what perhaps needs clearer explanation.
