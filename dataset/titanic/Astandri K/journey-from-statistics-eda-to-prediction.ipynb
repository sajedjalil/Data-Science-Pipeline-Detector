At Q2(50%) and Q3(75%) we could see the value is 3, which could means *there are minimum 50% (or more) passengers which is 3rd class passengers*. It seems logical since lower class usually have cheaper ticket prize, and more quota for that class\n\n3. **Age**: from train and test data, the count values seems different from the others. yes, **Age attribute contains missing values**. Another usefull information, the mean/average age on training data is 29 years old, which is 1 years older than the median value of the mean (30 mean and 27 median on test dataset), so what does it mean?\n    \n    it means the distributions of age values have **right skew**, which we expect some outliers in the *higher age value* (on the right size ofthe axis. As we can see, on the training and test dataset max value is 80 and 76 respectively.\n    \n4. **SibSp and Parch**: these attributes indicate number of SIblings or spouses, and Parent or Children number aboard. From the mean value, seems *majority of the passengers is alone (neither have SibSp or Parch)*. It is interesting that we see the maximum value have 8 SibSp and 9 ParCh, *maybe the oldest person brought his/her entire family on the ship*\n\n5. **Fare**: there are huge difference between mean and median value of this attributes, which is logical. *Many passengers from 3rd class which always have lower Fare*, on the other hand, we have so high value on max of Fare here, which seems an outlier that affect the average of this attributes (**again, right skew**). **Fare attribute contain 1 missing value on test dataset**"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19e360b1-d740-46b9-b9f5-5b565fe08e55","_uuid":"b306355d32d449699dbe241c6834378ebdbb6aa3"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"train.describe(include=['O'])"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a7f51a24-16ca-4217-b7d9-1b2b0156bee3","_uuid":"b43edb773c70c501d860f9d8cd675f19e5aa3df9"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"test.describe(include=['O'])"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f6e3b090-122f-4d1a-bf12-6f53b57a19dd","_uuid":"9e1fcb0b0a1f76277d8e9f4bc45106fd9282c450"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**A.2 Categorical Attributes**\nNow, we're dealing with categorical attributes.
