Introduction**\n\nI decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of my favorite competitions on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering**. A lot of people start Kaggle with this competition and they get lost in extremely long tutorial kernels. This is a short kernel compared to the other ones. I hope this will be a good guide for starters and inspire them with new feature engineering ideas.\n\n**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about Titanic. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. I tried to find out some of those secret factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking. I believe there are other features still waiting to be discovered. \n\nThis kernel has **3** main sections; **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Feature Engineering** and **Model**, and it can achieve top **2%** (**0.83732**) public leaderboard score with a tuned Random Forest Classifier. It takes 60 seconds to run whole notebook. If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like. If you didn't understand any part, feel free to ask."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"darkgrid\")\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n\nimport string\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nSEED = 42","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f7dc1cb7b8813f315a8b30fd636b3d46b4270496"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Training set has **891** rows and test set has **418** rows\n* Training set have **12** features and test set have **11** features\n* One extra feature in training set is `Survived` feature, which is the target variable"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"467443fda7135a8ce89c4d537da3f3a8546e2384","_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def concat_df(train_data, test_data):\n    # Returns a concatenated df of training and test set\n    return pd.concat([train_data, test_data], sort=True).reset_index(drop=True)\n\ndef divide_df(all_data):\n    # Returns divided dfs of training and test set\n    return all_data.loc[:890], all_data.loc[891:].drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\n\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\ndf_all = concat_df(df_train, df_test)\n\ndf_train.name = 'Training Set'\ndf_test.name = 'Test Set'\ndf_all.name = 'All Set' \n\ndfs = [df_train, df_test]\n\nprint('Number of Training Examples = {}'.format(df_train.shape[0]))\nprint('Number of Test Examples = {}\\n'.format(df_test.shape[0]))\nprint('Training X Shape = {}'.format(df_train.shape))\nprint('Training y Shape = {}\\n'.format(df_train['Survived'].shape[0]))\nprint('Test X Shape = {}'.format(df_test.shape))\nprint('Test y Shape = {}\\n'.format(df_test.shape[0]))\nprint(df_train.columns)\nprint(df_test.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dfabd70ff1cbd50e3107727e5bb630aa59110d83"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **1.
