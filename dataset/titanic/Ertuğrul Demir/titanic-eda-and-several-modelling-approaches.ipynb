I'm still learning and trying to improve my skills, so there might be some areas can be improved.\n\n\n### My main objectives on this project are:\n\n* Explorating and visualising the data, trying to get some insights about our dataset,\n* Getting data in better shape by feature engineering to help us in building better models,\n* Building and tuning couple regression models to get some stable results on predicting Titanic disaster outcome.\n\n### In this notebook we are going to try explore the data we have and going try answer questions like:\n\n- What is the survival rate for specific groups?\n- Is there any relation between given info of passengers and their survival?\n- Was women and children first policy in order?\n- Having higher social status in helped people getting in life boats?\n- The mustering order from captain was highly dependent on the class of the passengers, can we spot this  effect between pclass and the survival rates?\n- What are the effects of being alone or with family?\n\n- Can we predict if a passenger survived from the disaster with using machine learning techniques?\n- What can our predictions achieve with different approaches?\n- How are the ROC and Learning curves looks like for different models and can they help with selecting right one?\n- If we decrease dimensionality by feature selection and extraction, what would be the effects on the models?\n- How are the decision regions looks like for different estimators?\n\n\n\n#### If you liked this kernel feel free to upvote and leave feedback, thanks!\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"toc_section\"></a>\n## Table of Contents\n* [Introduction](#top_section)\n    - [Well...

This confirms women part of the \"Women and children first policy\" had an effect in our Titanic case.\n- Most of our passengers are travelling alone, they also have high casuality rate. So being married or with family has some positive effect on survival?\n- Most of the passenger are embarked from Southampton. Survival rates differ between ports but I'm not sure if it's important observation or just random.
