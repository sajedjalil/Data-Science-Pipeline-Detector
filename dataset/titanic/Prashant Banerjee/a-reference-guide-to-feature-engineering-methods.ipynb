Incomplete data is an unavoidable problem in dealing with most data sources.\n\n\n- **Imputation** is the act of replacing missing data with statistical estimates of the missing values.

When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n\n- If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would not bias the inferences made.\n\n#### **Missing at Random, MAR**\n\n- MAR occurs when there is a systematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data. In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset). For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR. The weight information will be missing at random for those men and women that decided not to disclose their weight, but as men are more prone to disclose it, there will be more missing values for women than for men.\n\n- In a situation like the above, if we decide to proceed with the variable with missing values (in this case weight), we might benefit from including gender to control the bias in weight for the missing observations.\n\n#### **Missing Not at Random, MNAR**\n\n- Missing of values is not at random (MNAR) if their being missing depends on information not recorded in the dataset. In other words, there is a mechanism or a reason why missing values are introduced in the dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **3.1 Complete Case Analysis (CCA) ** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.1\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Complete case analysis** implies analysing only those observations in the dataset that contain values in all the variables. In other words, in complete case analysis we remove all observations with missing values. This procedure is suitable when there are few observations with missing data in the dataset. \n\n- **So complete-case analysis (CCA)**, also called list-wise deletion of cases, consists in simply discarding observations where values in any of the variables are missing. Complete Case Analysis means literally analysing only those observations for which there is information in all of the variables (Xs).\n\n- But, if the dataset contains missing data across multiple variables, or some variables contain a high proportion of missing observations, we can easily remove a big chunk of the dataset, and this is undesirable. \n\n- CCA can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables.\n\n- In practice, CCA may be an acceptable method when the amount of missing information is small. In many real life datasets, the amount of missing data is never small, and therefore CCA is typically never an option.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **CCA on Titanic dataset**\n\n- Now, I will demonstrate the application of CCA on titanic dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for data visualization\nimport seaborn as sns # for statistical data visualization\nimport pylab \nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport datetime\n%matplotlib inline\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ignore warnings\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the dataset\ntitanic = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# make a copy of titanic dataset\ndata1 = titanic.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":" # check the percentage of missing values per variable\n\ndata1.isnull().mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Now, if we chose to remove all the missing observations, we would end up with a very small dataset, given that Cabin is missing for 77% of the observations.

Mean / median / mode imputation is widely adopted in organisations and data competitions. Although in practice this technique is used in almost every situation, the procedure is suitable if data is missing at random and in small proportions. If there are a lot of missing observations, however, we will distort the distribution of the variable, as well as its relationship with other variables in the dataset. Distortion in the variable distribution may affect the performance of linear models. \n\n- Mean/median imputation consists of replacing all occurrences of missing values (NA) within a variable by the mean (if the variable has a Gaussian distribution) or median (if the variable has a skewed distribution).\n\n- For categorical variables, replacement by the mode, is also known as replacement by the most frequent category.\n\n- Mean/median imputation has the assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). If this is the case, we can think of replacing the NA with the most frequent occurrence of the variable, which is the mean if the variable has a Gaussian distribution, or the median otherwise.\n\n- The rationale is to replace the population of missing values with the most frequent value, since this is the most likely occurrence.\n\n- When replacing NA with the mean or median, the variance of the variable will be distorted if the number of NA is big respect to the total number of observations (since the imputed values do not differ from the mean or from each other). Therefore leading to underestimation of the variance.\n\n- In addition, estimates of covariance and correlations with other variables in the dataset may also be affected. This is because we may be destroying intrinsic correlations since the mean/median that now replace NA will not preserve the relation with the remaining variables.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Mean / Median / Mode Imputation on Titanic dataset**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# make a copy of titanic dataset\ndata2 = titanic.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check the percentage of NA values in dataset\n\ndata2.isnull().mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Important Note**\n\n- Imputation should be done over the training set, and then propagated to the test set.

This technique preserves the variable distribution, and is well suited for data missing at random. But, we need to account for randomness by adequately setting a seed. Otherwise, the same missing observation could be replaced by different values in different code runs, and therefore lead to a different model predictions. This is not desirable when using our models within an organisation.\n\n- Replacing of NA by random sampling for categorical variables is exactly the same as for numerical variables.\n\n- Random sampling consist of taking a random observation from the pool of available observations of the variable, that is, from the pool of available categories, and using that randomly extracted value to fill the NA. In Random Sampling one takes as many random observations as missing values are present in the variable.\n\n- By random sampling observations of the present categories, we guarantee that the frequency of the different categories/labels within the variable is preserved.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Random sample imputation has the assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR).

Replacement by an arbitrary value is suitable if data is not missing at random, or if there is a huge proportion of missing values. If all values are positive, a typical replacement is -1. Alternatively, replacing by 999 or -999 are common practice. We need to anticipate that these arbitrary values are not a common occurrence in the variable. Replacement by arbitrary values however may not be suited for linear models, as it most likely will distort the distribution of the variables, and therefore model assumptions may not be met.\n\n \n- For categorical variables, this is the equivalent of replacing missing observations with the label “Missing” which is a widely adopted procedure.\n\n- Replacing the NA by artitrary values should be used when there are reasons to believe that the NA are not missing at random. In situations like this, we would not like to replace with the median or the mean, and therefore make the NA look like the majority of our observations.\n\n- Instead, we want to flag them.

This technique is similar in essence to imputing by an arbitrary value. However, by placing the value at the end of the distribution, we need not look at each variable distribution individually, as the algorithm does it automatically for us. This imputation technique tends to work well with tree-based algorithms, but it may affect the performance of linear models, as it distorts the variable distribution.\n\n- On occasions, one has reasons to suspect that missing values are not missing at random. And if the value is missing, there has to be a reason for it. Therefore, we would like to capture this information.\n\n- Adding an additional variable indicating missingness may help with this task.

Do mean/median imputation+adding an additional binary variable to capture missingness add a 'Missing' label in categorical variables.\n\n- If the number of NA in a variable is small, they are unlikely to have a strong impact on the variable / target that you are trying to predict. Therefore, treating them specially, will most certainly add noise to the variables. Therefore, it is more useful to replace by mean/random sample to preserve the variable distribution.\n\n- If the variable / target you are trying to predict is however highly unbalanced, then it might be the case that this small number of NA are indeed informative. \n\n#### Exceptions\n\n- If we suspect that NAs are not missing at random and do not want to attribute the most common occurrence to NA, and if we don't want to increase the feature space by adding an additional variable to indicate missingness - in these cases, replace by a value at the far end of the distribution or an arbitrary value.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **4.

Responses fall into a fixed set of categories.\n\n- You will get an error if you try to plug these variables into most machine learning models in Python without \"encoding\" them first. Here we'll show the most popular method for encoding categorical variables.\n\n\n- Categorical variable encoding is a broad term for collective techniques used to transform the strings or labels of categorical variables into numbers. There are multiple techniques under this method:\n\n  1. One-Hot encoding (OHE)\n  \n  2. Ordinal encoding\n\n  3. Count and Frequency encoding\n\n  4. Target encoding / Mean encoding\n\n  5.

These binary variables take 1 if the observation shows a certain category or 0 otherwise. OHE is suitable for linear models. But, OHE expands the feature space quite dramatically if the categorical variables are highly cardinal, or if there are many categorical variables. In addition, many of the derived dummy variables could be highly correlated.\n\n- OHE, consists of replacing the categorical variable by different boolean variables, which take value 0 or 1, to indicate whether or not a certain category / label of the variable was present for that observation. Each one of the boolean variables are also known as dummy variables or binary variables.\n\n- For example, from the categorical variable \"Gender\", with labels 'female' and 'male', we can generate the boolean variable \"female\", which takes 1 if the person is female or 0 otherwise. We can also generate the variable male, which takes 1 if the person is \"male\" and 0 otherwise.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# make a copy of titanic dataset\n\ndata7 = titanic.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data7['Sex'].head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# one hot encoding\n\npd.get_dummies(data7['Sex']).head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# for better visualisation\npd.concat([data7['Sex'], pd.get_dummies(data7['Sex'])], axis=1).head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- We can see that we only need 1 of the 2 dummy variables to represent the original categorical variable `Sex`.

If we encode categories arbitrarily, we assign an integer per category from 1 to n, where n is the number of unique categories. If instead, we assign the integers in an informed manner, we observe the target distribution: we order the categories from 1 to n, assigning 1 to the category for which the observations show the highest mean of target value, and n to the category with the lowest target mean value.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- We can use [Category Encoders Package](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/) to perform ordinal encoding.

These techniques capture the representation of each label in a dataset, but the encoding may not necessarily be predictive of the outcome. \n\n- This approach is heavily used in Kaggle competitions, wherein we replace each label of the categorical variable by the count, this is the amount of times each label appears in the dataset.

Thus, these outlier observations no longer differ from the rest of the values at the tails of the distribution, as they are now all together in the same interval / bucket. In addition, by creating appropriate bins or intervals, discretisation can help spread the values of a skewed variable across a set of bins with equal number of observations.\n\n- There are several approaches to transform continuous variables into discrete ones. This process is also known as **binning**, with each bin being each  interval. \n\n- **Discretisation** refers to sorting the values of the variable into bins or intervals, also called buckets.
