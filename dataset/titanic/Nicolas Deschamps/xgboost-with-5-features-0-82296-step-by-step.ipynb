Everything is explained step by step.\n\nNote that this introduction explains basically everything you need to know. Once you read it, you will be able to do your own work to reach 82%. So don't skip it :)\n\n**Warning**: Some of technics exposed here can be considered as data leakage. So if it's your first machine learning experience, maybe you don't want to start with the method exposed here. This notebook shows how you can reach the top leaderboard in the context of a Kaggle competition, not how to write the best model for a production environment.\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) for all his amazing work about the Titanic competition and especially for his \"[Woman Child Group model](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/titanic-using-name-only-0-81818/notebook)\" which highly inspires my kernel. Without his work, I couldn't have done this notebook.\n\nAnd I want to thank [Tae Hyon Whang](https://www.kaggle.com/numbersareuseful) for his work [here](https://www.kaggle.com/numbersareuseful/titanic-starter-with-xgboost-173-209-lb/notebook) which helped me perform a best gridsearch for my XGBoost hyper-parameters.\n\n### A bit of context\n\nWhen I decided to try to make a good score on the Titanic competition, my first thought was: All I need is:\n\n1. First, let's say a pretty \"classical and strong\" feature engineering: clean all data, impute empty values, extract all informations like name title, cabin letter and so on.\n\n2. And then, perform an effective gridsearch to find the best hyper-parameters for XGBoost.\n\nBut... I was kind of wrong. I tried A LOT of stuffs following this direction. But nothing really worked. I tried to make the best model to impute empty values, like fill empty ages with XGBoost, I tried a lot of combinations between features. But my best score was stuck to around 0.78%, maybe 0.79%. I didn't understand why I couldn't reach 0.80%, which was basically my goal.\n\nSo I started to dig in the top kernels. To be honest, I saw a lot of kernels which were supposed to be good, but which weren't. And I noticed that the best kernels in this competition are not always the most famous ones.\n\nAnyway, let's try to explain what are the keys of the success for this competition.\n\n### Avoid overfitting\n\nThe first problem with the Titanic dataset is overfitting. At first it seems like each feature is giving you a lot of new insights. But the more I digged, the more I realized the information was **highly redondant**. And since we don't have a lot of observations, we have to be careful about it.\n\n### About gender and children\n\nFirst of all, never forget one thing: The simple gender model where you predict all women survived and all men died reachs a leaderboard score more than 76%.\n\nSo, yes: your fate on the Titanic was highly correlated with your gender: if you're a man, you'll probably die. If you're a woman, you'll probably survive.\n\nWe can also say that if you're a boy, you'll probably survive too. Because \"Women and Children First!\" was true.\n\nSo if you want to do a better job than this very simple model, you have to try to predict some women and children that died. And try to predict some men who survived (this is the most difficult).\n\n### Money, money, money\n\nAt first, I was persuaded that if you just add \"money features\" like \"PClass\" and \"Ticket Fare\" (in addition to gender), this will help a lot. Actually, it could help. But as we'll see, the class influences the fate of the entire family, more than each individual passenger.\n\nAnd as you'll see, I don't use any \"money feature\" in this model.\n\n### How old are you?\n\nThe age is not that useful that I thought too. Because, basically: if you're a woman, you'll survive, either you're young or old. If you're a man, you'll survive if you're under 16. But since there are a lot of missing values, it's better to use the \"Master\" title which is filled for everybody!\n\nSo we won't use the Age feature in this model.\n\n### It's all about group!\n\nXGBoost can find a lot of connexions, even subtle and complex connexions. That's why it works pretty well. But, you still have to help it with a good feature engineering. So here is the real key of the success:\n\nFor this competition, a good feature ingineering implies realizing that passengers can form **groups**! Without it, you won't be able to reach 0.80%. The groups can be formed by a same surname or a same ticket.\n\nBut your model can't discover it by itself. You have to do something. The natural way to do it would be: extracting names (and / or tickets) and dummify it. Et voilà ! Now your model knows how to connect passengers to each other. But... no. The dataset is too short to do this. On the boat, you don't have four or five families. You have hundreds. So It will be too much groups, too much features.\n\nSo, the only way is to identify groups and after that you have to find a way to attribute one or several scores to your groups which will be your new features(s). And once again, you will have to choose a good way to do it, because you don't want to overfit.\n\n### Woman Child Groups\n\nI choosed the \"woman child group\" approach formalized by Chris Deotte. And then I combined name groups with ticket groups. And finally, thanks to XGBoost, I used a pretty convenient feature of this algorithm: you can feed it with empty data. So your dummy variables can actually take three different values.\n\nBasically, the idea is: all families died or survived together. When we say \"family\", we think about \"women and children\". Because, yes, if you're a man, you probably died anyway.\n\nSo, the idea is to analyze WC groups and try to score them.\n\n1. If all women and children survived, we will notice it. (New feature equals 1)\n2. If they all died, we'll also notice it. (Another new feature equals 1)\n3. Sometimes we'll be able to say \"it's neither one nor the other. It's a mixed group\". (Both features equal 0)\n4. And sometimes, we can't say anything, so we'll say nothing: for this, thanks to XGBoost which can take into account empty values.\n\nSo, as we can see with this model: a majority of the information to predict passengers fate is concentred in:\n\n1. Your gender\n2. The rest of your group\n\nAnd of course some features probably influence your group's fate. But this model doesn't event use PClass or Ticket price.\n\nYou're a man? You probably died, either you're rich or not. You're a child or a woman? Let's have a look at what happened to your family and I'll tell if you survived or not.\n\nSo, at the end, the dataset is composed of five features:\n\n1. Are you a woman?\n2. Are you boy?\n3. Family size\n4. Are you in a woman-child group? Did all they survive?\n5. Are you in a woman-child group? Did all they die?\n\nOK, I wrote enough :) Let's have a look at the code!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import librairies & data\n\n### Librairies"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Standard library\nimport pickle\nimport warnings\n\n# Data analysis\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Modelization\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, GridSearchCV","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Files\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_set = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv\")\ntest_set = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Settings\n\nJust some display settings."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\npd.options.display.max_rows = 100\npd.options.display.max_columns = 100\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Functions\n\nDon't look at them now.

voilà !\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPredict some survived men seems to be the most complicated part and could be an improvement of this model.\n\nHere I tried to let XGBoost do the work, after I fed it with features containing a lot of useful informations. Maybe some more complex interactions could help, but the most difficult part is giving new useful informations to the model without overfitting.\n\nI hope this notebook helped some of you. I learned a lot by making it, so if you learn reading it, I'll be glad :) The key is really to read other top kernels and try your own stuffs.
