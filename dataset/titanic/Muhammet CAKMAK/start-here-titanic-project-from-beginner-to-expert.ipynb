The Titanic ship was such a big ship that it was named as \"unsinkable\". The ship hit a large iceberg  and 1502 of the 2224 passengers carried by Titanic drowned. \n\nIn this dataset we will invesitgate the features and try to find which passengers are more likely to survive. We will use Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the survived passengers.In the end we will compare the performance of the various Machine Learning Algorithms. \n\n<font color = 'blue'>\n Content:\n   \n   1.
