A [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) describes how a random variable is distributed; it tells us which values a random variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely.\n\nIn statistics, there are a range of precisely defined probability distributions that have different shapes and can be used to model different types of random events.
