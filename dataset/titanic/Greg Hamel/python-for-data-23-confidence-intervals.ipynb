Data cleaning and exploratory analysis are often preliminary steps toward the end goal of extracting insight from data through statistical inference or predictive modeling. The remainder of this guide will focus on methods for analyzing data and tools for carrying out analyses in Python.\n\nStatistical inference is the process of analyzing sample data to gain insight into the population from which the data was collected and to investigate differences between data samples. In data analysis, we are often interested in the characteristics of some large population, but collecting data on the entire population may be infeasible. For example, leading up to U.S. presidential elections it could be very useful to know the political leanings of every single eligible voter, but surveying every voter is not feasible. Instead, we could poll some subset of the population, such as a thousand registered voters, and use that data to make inferences about the population as a whole."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Point Estimates"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Point estimates are estimates of population parameters based on sample data. For instance, if we wanted to know the average age of registered voters in the U.S., we could take a survey of registered voters and then use the average age of the respondents as a point estimate of the average age of the population as a whole. The average of a sample is known as the sample mean.\n\nThe sample mean is usually not exactly the same as the population mean. This difference can be caused by many factors including poor survey design, biased sampling methods and the randomness inherent to drawing a sample from a population.

At a high level, the theorem states the distribution of many sample means, known as a sampling distribution, will be normally distributed. This rule holds even if the underlying distribution itself is not normally distributed.

A confidence interval is a range of values above and below a point estimate that captures the true population parameter at some predetermined confidence level. For example, if you want to have a 95% chance of capturing the true population parameter with a point estimate and a corresponding confidence interval, you'd set your confidence level to 95%. Higher confidence levels result in a wider confidence intervals.\n\nCalculate a confidence interval by taking a point estimate and then adding and subtracting a margin of error to create a range. Margin of error is based on your desired confidence level, the spread of the data and the size of your sample.

Since the sample standard deviation may not match the population parameter the interval will have more error when you don't know the population standard deviation. To account for this error, we use what's known as a t-critical value instead of the z-critical value. The t-critical value is drawn from what's known as a t-distribution--a distribution that closely resembles the normal distribution but that gets wider and wider as the sample size falls.
