In my mind, I still keep a picture of all those people, outside the cinema, in the queue to buy tickets. Back then, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were just two young kids with nice haircuts and online tickets were science fiction.\n\nAccording to engineers, a class to which I proudly belong, the Titanic was the unsinkable ship. It was beautiful, luxurious and fitted with the best of the technology. Titanic was the state-of-the-art cruiser. It just wasn't that unsinkable.\n\nAfter 100 years, the Titanic still remains a discussion subject in the most diverse areas. For example, you can find [books](https://amzn.to/2Gie0Pv) where the author take leadership lessons from the Titanic to apply in business; you can find interesting [AI projects](http://fortune.com/2018/03/26/china-titanic-artificial-intelligence-sensetime/) that apply deep learning to distinguish Titanic’s romantic scenes from disaster scenes; or you can find extensive exercises of creative thinking regarding [what really happened with the Titanic](https://www.bustle.com/p/6-titanic-conspiracy-theories-that-are-still-fascinating-today-28519).\n\nWe will also use Titanic for a specific purpose: to learn **exploratory data analysis** and **feature extraction** techniques. Through a complete analysis of the Kaggle's Titanic problem, we will see what to do, where to begin and how to proceed in a data science problem. Topics like **data visualization**, **missing data imputation**, **feature engineering**, **feature selection**, and **logistic regression** will be addressed, serving you repeatedly because after you see what's involved, you'll be able to apply these techniques to any kind of data science problem.\n\nSince I'm a true believer of the transforming power of startups, and seeing obvious similarities between what startups do and what a data scientist does, several references to startup methods are present in the text. Also, you'll find some Titanic jokes. Not that I'm a believer in their power to make someone laugh, but just because they are terrific icebreakers...\n\nThis kernel has been divided into four parts. The first part deals with the development of a baseline model. This model should allow us to quickly understand the problem and the data. Afterwards, we will go into detail. Data will be studied and enriched through exploratory data analysis and feature extraction, to improve the performance of our machine learning model. Finally, some conclusions will be drawn from this kernel and its impact in our data science journey.\n\n**Index**\n\n1. [The lean data set](#1.-The-lean-data-set)\n\n 1.1.

Through a series of anecdotes and stories, Ries teaches us all we need to know about agility and lean methodology in the startup world.\n\nWhile a set of important principles are taught throughout the book, the truth is that the lean startup methodology always ends up in an attempt to answer to the question: 'Should this product be built?' \n\nTo answer this question, the lean startup approach relies on a Build-Measure-Learn process. This process emphasizes rapid iteration as a critical ingredient to product development. It goes through the following phases:\n1. **Build**. Figure out the problem that needs to be solved, generate ideas about how to solve it, and select the best one. Turn your best idea into a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\n2. **Measure**. Test your product. Go to your customers and measure their reactions and behaviors against your product.  \n3. **Learn**. Analyse the data you collected when testing the product with your customers. Draw conclusions from the experiment and decide what to do next.\nIn other words, this is a validated learning process that quickly builds, tests, and rebuilds products, according to users' feedback. This reduces your market risks by failing fast and cheap, to get you closer and closer to what the market really needs.\n\nThis kernel does something similar. We will try to fail fast and cheap by quickly building a working end-to-end pipeline (Build). Then, we will instrument the system to evaluate its performance (Measure). Finally, we will make incremental changes to improve the system's performance (Learn). Note that this practical methodology was adapted from Goodfellow et al. (2016), a book you can access for free [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).\n\nInitially, we will not invest much time with exploratory data analysis. We will just do the minimum viable effort to implement a reasonable model. This model will be our 'Minimum Viable Model'. Later, we will try to beat this model by enriching our data.\n\n**Pop quiz:** was the Titanic a MVP?","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7fd25c6d-d20c-4d68-b283-ee6cf4d3313f","_uuid":"68c1fb7bcf60ac0a5dd7931e1c528ad1df7fb207"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1.

The mean shows us the central tendency of the distribution, while the standard deviation quantifies its amount of variation.

Missing data occurs when no data value on one or more variables is available. Consequently, it reduces the size of the data set and is a possible source of bias, since some non-random mechanism can be generating the missing data. As a result, missing data introduces uncertainty in our analysis.\n\nThere are several strategies to deal with missing data. Some of the most common are: \n* Use only valid data, deleting the cases where data is missing.  \n* Impute data using values from similar cases or using the mean value. \n* Impute data using model-based methods, in which models are defined to predict the missing values.\n\nUntil today, I've never found a 'one size fits all' solution. I have some dogmas (e.g. I usually exclude variables with more than 25% of missing data), but what usually guides my analysis is intuition, critical thinking and need (sometimes we need to leave our dogmas at the door, if we want to generate some results).\n\nMy practical advice to handle missing data is to learn a different set of tools. Play with them according to your needs, test them and you should be fine. A good introduction to the subject can be found in [Hair et al. (2013)](https://amzn.to/2M9v0uW). This book has a practical summary about missing data and provides a framework that you can apply in almost all situations. Also, I wrote a technical paper comparing different imputation techniques, which I can share with you if you want.\n\nNow that we can see the tip of the iceberg, let's dive into the subject.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2f8e3feb-8ac9-4fe9-8434-2481c6d0bcb0","_uuid":"bb694a1ba0d01b026588d5dce1d0ffecbd145021"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Analyse missing data\ndraw_missing_data_table(df)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ee32f22a-c620-449c-975c-53b7cfe5900f","_uuid":"d31401ab943a22b62e3c9de19735e1d9bb8536c9","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First thoughts:\n\n* 'Cabin' has too many missing values (>25%).

(2016)](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/guidelines.html) proposes an analogous approach for the application of machine learning models. As the authors point out, the successful application of machine learning techniques goes beyond the knowledge of algorithms and their principles. To successfully apply machine learning techniques, we need to start with a simple model that we can master and understand. Only then we should move to more complex algorithms.\n\nThe authors propose a practical four-steps methodology:\n1. Select a performance metric and a target value for this metric. This metric will guide your work and allow you to know how well you're performing. In our case, our performance metric will be 'accuracy' because it is the one defined by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#evaluation).\n2. Quickly set up a working end-to-end pipeline. This should allow you to estimate the selected performance metric.\n3. Monitor the system to understand its behaviour, in particular to understand whether its poor performance is related to underfitting, overfitting or defects.\n4. Improve the system by iteration. Here we can apply feature engineering, tune hyperparameters or even change the algorithm, according to the outputs of our monitoring system.\n\nWe will follow this methodology. Accordingly, our aim will be to get an initial model that we can use as a first baseline approach. This model will be our 'Minimum Viable Model' (MVM).

However, it has several limitations. For example, we are using unrealistic replacement values, which are out of range and distort data distribution. Accordingly, now that we are improving the model, it makes sense to develop a different imputation method.\n\nOne way to improve our imputation method is to estimate the missing values based on known relationships. In our case, we can do this by using the information in the variable 'Name'. Looking to 'Name' values, we can see person's name and title. Person's title is a relevant information to estimate ages. To give an example, we know that a person with the title 'Master' is someone under 13 years old, since ['a boy can be addressed as master only until age 12'](http://bit.ly/2HfFHZr). Therefore, employing the information in 'Name' we can improve our imputation method.\n\nThe steps to implement this new imputation method are:\n* Extract titles from 'Name'.\n* Plot a figure with both features and confirm that there is a connection between titles and age.\n* For each title, get people's average age and use it to fill missing values.\n\nLet's see how this work, before you start with sinking feelings.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2c36694c-80c6-48b3-be4b-23576b35942a","_uuid":"1aa117116a8016565a8d62ad217aa20d87ce1e75"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect names\ndf_raw['Name'].unique()[:10]","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cc1c2eac-0f8d-4132-8914-eec28a1797f4","_uuid":"5aacf45feaf5e6830486ce4f5eabbcbc498386c3","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The rule seems to be: *'last name'* + *','* + *'title'* + *'other names'*","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6ba0e20f-1d27-4139-b9eb-2d74956f5b7e","_uuid":"009fbc56d540e3a1f89210511dedf5eca8b9aadf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract titles from name\ndf['Title']=0\nfor i in df:\n    df['Title']=df_raw['Name'].str.extract('([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)  # Use REGEX to define a search pattern\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"548251db-e3d9-4f7e-b2f4-4541d293f093","_uuid":"16c8d75f775cd1666d7c76743e160a1e80240045","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Unique titles\ndf['Title'].unique()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7956bc9f-83f1-4ee5-9d41-06b5211df02d","_uuid":"510da6e93fe40b26406b203cef5944ab5802a753","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plot bar plot (titles, age and sex)\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,5))\nsns.barplot(x=df['Title'], y=df_raw['Age']);","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6d922d6d-814d-4454-8e1d-0c9bca7cf2d8","_uuid":"a1dfe995323f82cc5ad9119b3c30ea8c208a0541","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Bar plot gives us an estimate of central tendency for a numeric variable (height of each rectangle) and an indication of the uncertainty around that estimate (error bars in black).\n* Apart from Rev and Dr, which have a larger error bar, the mean value seems to accurately represent the data of all the other features.

However, it's fairly easy to fall into a 'data diving' trap (especially if you're solving problems about sunken ships) and get lost into the process. When that happens, your analysis can end up like [this](https://youtu.be/CIQI3isddbE).\n\nWe can avoid this by following a hypothesis driven approach. The hypothesis driven approach consists in establishing hypothesis about the variables behaviour and their relationships, early in the process, to then focus on using data to prove (or disprove) those hypothesis. This makes our analysis very objective because we will be collecting just enough data to test specific hypothesis. As a result, we:\n* Increase speed. Since we will limit our analysis to some hypothesis and move forward.\n* Reduce effort. The amount of data and the number of tests will be only what is needed to verify your hypothesis. \n* Reduce risk. If you're right you succeed fast, if you're wrong you fail fast.\n\n[Here](http://gsl.mit.edu/media/programs/ghana-summer-2013/materials/problem_solving_grand_slam_7_steps_to_master_training_deck.pdf) you can find one of my favourite PowerPoint presentations about the benefits and procedures of a hypothesis driven approach in problem solving. Please note that, particularly when you really need to learn about the data set, it makes sense to put the diving cylinder and go dive into the depths of data analysis. However, if at the outset you can generate an educated guess of what the answer of your problem is, I think that you should test your hypothesis and learn from it as fast as you can.\n\nOk, now that I convinced you that the hypothesis driven approach is the [last coke in the desert](http://bit.ly/2oYzJ7U), let me show you how to apply it. Cases like the one we have are easy targets for the hypothesis driven approach because we don't have many variables, so we can more or less guess their impact. Accordingly, we will start by listing each of the variables and generate hypothesis about their relationship with the target variable ('Survived'). Then, we will test those hypothesis through a set of exploratory data analysis tools. As a result, we'll end up with a comprehensive view about the variables that should belong to our prediction model.\n\nLet's get started:\n\n* **PassengerId**. This is just an unique identification of each passenger. It's not expected to be relevant to our analysis.\n* **Survived**. Target variable. To sink or not to sink is the question of this exercise.\n* **Pclass**. This is the ticket class. According to Karl Marx, this should affect our target variable. First class should have a higher survival rate.\n* **Name**. Names are a form of social tagging, especially when accompanied by a title. As a consequence, it can lead to different forms of treatment. Let's keep an eye on this.\n* **Sex**. Always important.\n* **Age**. It should make a difference. For example, children are usually evacuated first in a disaster, so that we can think about a solution in silence... Joking, the true reason why 'Age' matters is this [one](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1254788/Why-women-children-saved-Titanic-Lusitania.html#ixzz54KETWEPr).\n* **SibSp**. Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic. I'd say that it's easier to survive if you're with your family than if you're travelling alone. [Teamwork](https://youtu.be/1qzzYrCTKuk)!\n* **Parch**. Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic. It should play with 'SibSp'.\n* **Ticket**. This is the ticket number. Unless it has some information about places, it shouldn't be important for prediction purposes.\n* **Fare**. Same logic as 'Pclass'.\n* **Cabin**. The cabin number can indicate where people were during the disaster. It wouldn't be surprising if it had some influence in survival chances, but this variable was excluded due to the high percentage of missing values.\n* **Embarked**. When the sun rises, it rises for everyone. It's not expectable that people coming from Cherbourg are more unlucky than people coming from Southampton. Unless there is some second order effect, [like refusing to run away to keep your honor as a man](http://www.mindblowing-facts.org/2013/07/the-only-japanese-who-survived-the-titanic-lost-his-job-because-he-was-known-as-a-coward-in-japan-for-not-dying-with-the-other-passengers/), I would say that this variable is not important.\n\nNow, step by step, let's perform our analysis.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3578d65f-0c7a-4bc3-a7fa-e788e463e57f","_uuid":"43547eb4335ee508e030bddcab7ab10d3d96531d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2.1.

According to the authors, it is fundamental technical insight that allows companies to create great products, which provide real value to the customers. For example, [PageRank](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/courses/BIB/pagerank.htm) gave an incredible competitive advantage to Google in relation to other search engines, by providing a far better way to rank search results on the web.\n\nFeature extraction is our technological insight in machine learning. It addresses the problem of attaining the most informative and compact set of features, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Let's go step-by-step. First, we are talking about 'informative'. This means that we are looking for features that can characterize the behaviour of what we are trying to model. For instance, if we want to model the weather, features like temperature, humidity and wind are informative (they are related to the problem). By contrast, the result of a football game will not be an informative feature because it doesn't affect the weather.\n\nRegarding 'compact', what we mean is that we want to exclude irrelevant features from our model. There are several reasons to exclude irrelevant features. In our case, I'd say that the most important is to reduce overfitting. Taking the weather example again: we know that football scores do not affect weather, but suppose that all rain instances in our training set happen to occur after a [Benfica](https://youtu.be/qX0D7xkF33s) victory. Then, our model might learn that rain is related to Benfica's victories, which is not true. Such an incorrect generalization from an irrelevant feature of the training set would result in a machine learning model that fits a particular set of data, but fails to predict future observations reliably (overfitting). \n\nThese two main issues are addressed in the following sub-sections:\n1. Feature engineering, which is related to the generation of informative features; \n2. Feature selection, which regards the choice of a compact set of features.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"093d98a3-0e28-447f-8f2f-add482629766","_uuid":"df5b074c2a1e9c502e54ea2527ca74743a9fc7c9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.3.1.

This approach selects features based on univariate statistical tests between each feature and the target variable. The intuition is that features that are independent from the target variable, are irrelevant for classification.\n\nWe will use the chi-squared test for feature selection.

(2009)](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/pt-PT//pubs/archive/35179.pdf) noted 'invariably, simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data.' [Monica Rogati](https://youtu.be/F7iopLnhDik) added that 'better data beats more data'. Based on these principles, the aim of this study was to improve data quality through exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. We didn't use a clever algorithm, but we explored clever techniques to make our data better.\n\nMy expectation is that after reading this kernel, you can start compiling a cookbook of techniques in exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. These techniques will help you to obtain confidence in your data and engage with any data science problem. Also, the more you use and refine these techniques, the more you'll develop your problem solving intuition.\n\nNow, it's your turn. Make this work yours. Select a part of this kernel and play with it. Why not trying a different feature selection process? Or what about applying a different imputation method? There are a hundred different ways to [steal this work like an artist](https://youtu.be/oww7oB9rjgw). Do it... After all, all unicorns started with a MVP.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9f04b0b1-177d-4f91-acfb-66a17d9d0876","_uuid":"3fd027961766c0243f3ca0ba5f9e8217e89e0377"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b07b837e-b626-494f-a33f-43b1e64e53f2","_uuid":"b6b196bff422c1ce06c690832eaa3fdd44d21907"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# You might also like\n* [My blog](http://pmarcelino.com/)\n* [Comprehensive data exploration in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c18f18df-c1c3-45a1-a434-b57bbec3d2f6","_uuid":"4b4ab9c9d9848a991af8802ea4d1997e7013bf8e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n\n**Books**\n\n* [Ries, E., 2011.
