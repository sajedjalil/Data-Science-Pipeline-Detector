This Notebook is written keeping in mind the basics.\n\nHello Fellow Kagglers,I decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of the Well-Known competition on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which tests your **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering** skills. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. At first this kernel would look Quite large , but if u stick to it to it , to the very end u will truly learn a lot.\n\n**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering** from other kernels available here , that can help Improve the accuracy of the model.\n\n**If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like.**\n\nI have researched and learned a lot from other kernels to provide better results. I just want to **`Thank`** the kaggle community for being so generous.    "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **1. Define The Problem**\n\n**Project Summary:**\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.\n\nI have tried my best to explain every complex code written and even given links in between for Reference.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\nPractice Skills\n* Binary classification\n* Python\n\n![alt text](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/titanic/images/f/f9/Titanic_side_plan.png/revision/latest?cb=20180322183733)\n\n# **2.

According to graph below, there are many titles that are occuring very few times. Some of those titles doesn't seem correct and they need to be replaced. **Miss**, **Mrs**, **Ms**, **Mlle**, **Lady**, **Mme**, **the Countess**, **Dona** titles are replaced with **Miss/Mrs/Ms** because all of them are female. Values like **Mlle**, **Mme** and **Dona** are actually the name of the passengers, but they are classified as titles because `Name` feature is split by comma. **Dr**, **Col**, **Major**, **Jonkheer**, **Capt**, **Sir**, **Don** and **Rev** titles are replaced with **Dr/Military/Noble/Clergy** because those passengers have similar characteristics. **Master** is a unique title. It is given to male passengers below age **26**. They have the highest survival rate among all males.\n\n`Is_Married` is a binary feature based on the **Mrs** title. **Mrs** title has the highest survival rate among other female titles.

What I am talking about is the **out-of-bag samples** to estimate the generalization accuracy. I will not go into details here about how it works. Just note that out-of-bag estimate is as accurate as using a test set of the same size as the training set. Therefore, using the out-of-bag error estimate removes the need for a set aside test set."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"oob score:\", round(random_forest.oob_score_, 4)*100, \"%\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"oob score:\", round(rf.oob_score_, 4)*100, \"%\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we can start tuning the hyperameters of random forest."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Hyperparameter Tuning"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **[What are Hyperparameters ?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-parameter-and-a-hyperparameter/)**\n* **[Ml-hyperparameter-tuning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-hyperparameter-tuning/)**\n\nBelow you can see the code of the hyperparamter tuning for the parameters criterion, min_samples_leaf, min_samples_split and n_estimators.\nI put this code into a markdown cell and not into a code cell, because it takes a long time to run it."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"param_grid = { \"criterion\" : [\"gini\", \"entropy\"], \"min_samples_leaf\" : [1, 5, 10,], \"min_samples_split\" : [2, 4, 10,], \"n_estimators\": [100,500,11000,1500]}\n\n\ngd=GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),param_grid=param_grid,verbose=True)\n\n\ngd.fit(X,Y)\n\n\nprint(gd.best_score_)\nprint(gd.best_estimator_)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Testing new Parameters:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(criterion='gini',\n                                           n_estimators=1750,\n                                           max_depth=7,\n                                           min_samples_split=6,\n                                           min_samples_leaf=6,\n                                           max_features='auto',\n                                           oob_score=True,\n                                           random_state=42,\n                                           n_jobs=-1,\n                                           verbose=1) \nrandom_forest.fit(X_train, Y_train)\nY_prediction = (random_forest.predict(X_test)).astype(int)\n\nrandom_forest.score(X_train, Y_train)\n\nprint(\"oob score:\", round(random_forest.oob_score_, 4)*100, \"%\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"StratifiedKFold is used for stratifying the target variable.
