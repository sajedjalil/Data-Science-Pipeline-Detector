Individuals create their own \"subjective reality\" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.\n>  1. some are due to ignoring relevant information (e.g., neglect of probability),\n>  2. some involve a decision or judgment being affected by irrelevant information (for example the framing effect where the same problem receives different responses depending on how it is described; or the distinction bias where choices presented together have different outcomes than those presented separately), and\n>  3. others give excessive weight to an unimportant but salient feature of the problem (e.g., anchoring).\n    \nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\n    \nWe may have cognitive biases when we first encounter datasets. For example, when looking at the features of the titanic dataset, you might think that gender and age are important without detailed analysis. Of course, such a decision could be right. However, we can receive feedback through the model to see if our thinking is correct and modify our thinking based on this. \n\nAt this point, we once again strongly say: **Machine! Tell Me Everything!**\n\nIn this notebook, we analyze the dataset in as many ways as possible and try to understand the behavior of the models and the dataset through this.\nTo do this, we would like to organize the notebook in the following order.\n1. First, check what outliers there are and what characteristics the outliers have.\n2. Perform detailed EDA and pre-process.\n3. Check which features are important in various ways.\n4.

It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library\n\nRef: https://github.com/fastai/fastai\n    \nModeling DL and setting of hyperparameters are more important compared to classical ML.

Ensembles combine multiple hypotheses to form a (hopefully) better hypothesis. The term ensemble is usually reserved for methods that generate multiple hypotheses using the same base learner.
