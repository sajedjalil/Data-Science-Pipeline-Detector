Although I will include some very popular models, I will mainly focus on Logistic Regression. In particular, I will write an **intuitive** derivation of logistic regression and what are the necessary assumptions that one should fulfill before choosing this model. I believe that many new data analyst/scientists often fall into the traps of blindly using different models without understanding them fully. This will lead to many problems like overfitting/underfitting, which can be costly especially if your model is used to determine some real world problems. That being said, most of us here may not be mathematically mature enough to understand the proofs, that is why the next best thing that one can do is to understand the intuition behind each algorithm, and that will help you a long way. \n\n<br>\n\nAlso, since I did not have any programming experience, I had a difficult time picking the language up at first - and therefore annotated codes with explanation beside. I will include those annotations in my Notebook.\n\n<br>\n\nIf you find my explanation clear and wish to see me do a similar one on some other Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest or others, please give me an upvote or leave a comment - **that will motivate me further**. \n\nAlso, you can clarify any questions through the comments. I will be quite active on Kaggle so I will reply almost every day. Furthermore, there are a lot of Kagglers who are extremely experienced and good with data science, please feel free to criticize and I will make the necessary amendments - this will **ensure** that the kernel is up to date and contain the most accurate materials.\n\n<br>\n\nLast but not least, section 7 will provide you with an intuitive logistic regression write up, a rough idea on how it works. \n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2) **Getting Started** <a id=\"start\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1) Importing Libraries <a id=\"library\"></a>\n\nThis is our very first step, we shall import the necessary libraries that we want into python.

There are various ways to import your datasets into python. Here I give an overview of what train and test datasets mean.\n<br>\n\n**Training and Testing Sets**\n\n   a) **Training data:** Training data is the information used to train an algorithm. The training data includes both input data and the corresponding expected output. We can train different machine learning algorithms on the training data, in the hopes of finding one best algorithm for a particular problem that predicts well. Bear in mind that even if our algorithm performs extremely well on the training data, it may be a result of overfitting, and may not replicate the same accuracy when the algorithm is applied to some unseen (test) data. \n\n   b) **Testing data:** On the other hand, includes only input data, not the corresponding expected output. The testing data is used to assess how well your algorithm was trained, and to estimate model properties.\n   \n<br>\n     \nSo in our training data, we see that our second column says whether the passenger survived or not. The survived column is our output.  And in our test data, the output is not there, it is for us to TEST if our model developed based on the training set is accurate. However the preceding sentence seems to have a problem, IF, in the real world, we do not have the 'answers' for the test data, how then, would we be able to tell how well the training algorithm is performing on the test set. To resolve that issue, we usually perform train test split/cross validation method on the given training set first.

This involves looking at your data set from many angles, describing it, and summarizing it without making any assumptions about its contents. This is a significant step to take before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling, to make sure the data are really what they are claimed to be and that there are no obvious problems. EDA should be part of the way data science operates in your organization.\n\n<br>\n\nA good data exploration is a preamble to the formal analysis. It allows the data scientist to:\n\n1) Verify expected relationships actually exist in the data, thus formulating and validating planned techniques of analysis.\n\n2) To find some unexpected structure (think: outliers etc) in the data that must be taken into account, thereby suggesting some changes in the planned analysis.\n\n3) Deliver data-driven insights to business stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions and not biasing the investigation with their assumptions.\n\n4) Provide the context around the problem to make sure the potential value of the data scientist’s output can be maximized.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We do some basic frequency plots to check the distribution of the data variables so that we can have a basic idea of the datasets.

Histograms VS Bar Charts\n\n    They are not the same! Here is the main difference between bar charts and histograms. With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by a categorical variable; and with histograms, each column represents a group defined by a continuous/quantitative variable.\n\n    One implication of this distinction: it is always appropriate to talk about the skewness of a histogram; that is, the tendency of the observations to fall more on the low end or the high end of the x axis.\n\n    With bar charts, however, the x axis does not have a low end or a high end; because the labels on the X axis are categorical - not quantitative. As a result, it is not appropriate to comment on the skewness of a bar chart.\n    \n    https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-histogram-and-a-bar-graph\n    \n    <br>\n    \n2. Line Charts\n    \n    In a much simpler way , we can say that Line Chart’s are basically used to compare changes in one value with respect to the other values in a visual manner.\n    Line chart’s are mostly used to find trend during a particular time period but can also be used for ordinal data.\n      So folk’s do remember that line chart can be used for Ordinal data, or Time series and comparison between one point to another.\n      \n      <br>\n      \n3. Scatterplots\n\n    Scatter plot graph is used to study the relationship between two variables. It basically shows how one variable is affected by the other.\n\n    Scatter plots usually consist of a large body of data. The closer the data points come when plotted to making a straight line, the higher the correlation between the two variables, or the stronger the relationship.\n    \n    <br>\n    \n4.

Let us try,\n\n#### Category variables count\n\nThe below plot is very useful:\n\n\n1. We first create a plot grid, with subplots on it, we define the figure size as usual, and now we pass some more conditions in it, we want to make plot multiple graphs on a grid of say 2 by 3 grid. In this way, if your code consists of repetitive graphing of a bar chart in the same fashion, we can just run a loop on this grid! \n\n2. For example, we want to plot a very simple frequency count for titanic's categorical variables, namely, survived, pclass, sex, sibsp, parch and embarked. So we can run the below code.\n\n3. Note for (u,v,z) in [[\"Survived\",0,0],[\"Pclass\",0,1],[\"Sex\",0,2], [\"SibSp\",1,0], [\"Parch\",1,1],[\"Embarked\",1,2]] just means for each element (u,v,z) in the list, we have u,v,z corresponding to each cross product in the list. Note, to say it explicitly, u is \"survived\", \"pclass\", etc.. v =0,1,2,..., z = 0,1,2,...\n\n    Now I am telling you that you need to pass 3 elements (u,v,z) in the for loop, but when you are creating the code the first time, you may not realise at first, so the computational thinking is you write out the codes like how you would manually:\n    \n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Survived\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Survived\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,0])\n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Pclass\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Pclass\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,1])\n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Sex\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Sex\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,2])\n    etc...\n    \n    So I suspect you need to loop through the categorical variables, survived, pclass, sex etc. And of course since you are plotting your graph on a 2x3 grid, we let our first graph appears in the place [0,0], second graph appears in the place [0,1], etc... So we want to loop through 3 things! So I should tell myself I need 3 elements to loop through in the for loop. And to do that it is now easy to see why I said: for (u,v,z) in [[\"Survived\",0,0],[\"Pclass\",0,1],...], However the [[..],[..],...] is hardcoded, but hey it is a good start to slowly cultivate your programming logic. \n    \n   I added on a bit of matplotlib codes, which should be relatively googlable, just want to add the same set of features onto each of my graph on myplot[v,z].

First we use our data = train and extract x = Sex column and y = Survived column. Next the underlying idea is to group the data by sex, so there are male and female. Then in each category of male and female, there are the survived or not by the \"Survived column\" represented by 0 and 1. Our estimator = np.mean = function mean and that means, for each category male and female, calculate their MEAN survived; for example there are 2 male with 0,1 and 3 females with 1,0,1, and by applying the estimator mean we have (0+1)/2 = 0.5 and (1+0+1)/3 = 2/3 which means 50% of the males survived and 66.6% of the females survived. In this case we got lucky cause survive column is only 0 and 1 ; In which case the mean of the survival rate of male and female is literally just the proportion of male, female who survived the titanic. \n\n    If I tweak the example just now to some other number like let survive = 2 and not survived = 3 then we will have (2+3)/2 = 2.5 and (3+2+3)/3 = 2.66 and those become 250% and 266% which are not meaningful.

The second count plot shows the actual distribution of male and female passengers that survived and did not survive. It shows that among all the females 233 survived and 314-233 = 81 did not survive. While among male passengers 109 survived and 577-109 = 468 did not survive. Also, male survival rate is only 18.9 percent while female survival rate is 74.2 percent.

As the owners of the algorithms, we need to choose carefully what features (inputs) we feed into the algorithm. If we decide to feed in some irrelevant or \"noisy\" features, then our algorithm may malfunction and produce bad results. \n\n<br>\n\nFor example, in our titanic dataset, we see passengerID column and decide to feed in blindly, the machine may really think there is an underlying pattern among the passengerIDs and train the algorithm to adapt to the \"non-existence pattern\". This may cause overfitting, and when we apply our algorithm to a new unseen data with passengerIDs (possibly with different passengerIDs), then our algorithm will perform badly!\n\n<br>\n\nBasically, all machine learning algorithms use some input data to create outputs. This input data comprise features, which are usually in the form of structured columns. Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly. Here, the need for feature engineering arises. I think feature engineering efforts mainly have two goals:\n\na) Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements.\n\nb) Improving the performance of machine learning models.\n\n<br>\n\nHere we will introduce a few feature engineering techniques, but may or may not go through all as this kernel is update in progress.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1) Imputation <a id=\"imp\"></a>\n\nIt is extremely annoying when your data sets have missing values. It is not wise to just delete them, or blindly replace them with the median/mean/mode. (Without knowing why the data is missing in the first place, we are unable to come up with a foolproof method for imputing the missing data). One could check some of the links here for further reading.\n\n- [columbia stats notes](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/missing.pdf)\n\n- [data imputation using regression](https://www.kaggle.com/shashankasubrahmanya/missing-data-imputation-using-regression/notebook)\n\n- [regression imputation stochastic vs deterministic](https://statisticsglobe.com/regression-imputation-stochastic-vs-deterministic/)\n\n- [statistical modelling for imputation and outliers](https://www.kaggle.com/caicell/statistical-modeling-imputation-outliers/notebook#3.-Imputation-and-Outliers)\n\n--- \n\nAnd today we are going to talk about a few ways of handling missing data, however, there are a lot of methods, and we shall not be greedy and attempt to understand all in one single session.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that filling in missing values may not just necessary mean filling in values that are not present. We should however be aware that certain data entries automatically convert NA/NAN values to 0. Therefore, even if you use `df.isnull()` to check and found that **there are no missing values**, that does not mean imputation is not needed. So a good habit is also to check if the numbers make sense or not. For example, if we are modelling the height of New York people and there are many people with height 0 cm, then it does not even make sense to begin with (although if you use `isnull` it will not show), so sometimes you have to be sharp and spot outlier values, and either remove them or impute them.\n\n**Some users said that it is convenient to work on concatenated training and test set while dealing with missing values, otherwise the filled data may overfit to separate training or test sets. I welcome people to discuss in the comments section on this. However, note for the parts below, I will not use the concatenated set to impute missing values.**\n\nThe amount of missing values in Age, Embarked and Fare features are relatively smaller compared to the total samples, but roughly 80% of the Cabin feature is missing. Missing values in Age, Embarked and Fare features can be filled with descriptive statistical measures, but that wouldn't work for Cabin feature. \n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Good Advice\n\nI had a good read from volhaleusha's kernel regarding on imputation: https://www.kaggle.com/volhaleusha/titanic-tutorial-encoding-feature-eng-81-8. The following long wall of text is extracted from various sources/kernels.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the dataset `Age, Embarked, Fare and Cabin` features have missing values.  \n\nThere are multiple ways to deal with missing values in dataset and chosen strategy highly depends on type feature type, amount of missing values, size of dataset and etc.  \n\n\n**Missing - Data Mechanism**\n\nTo decide how to handle missing data, it is helpful to know why they are missing. We consider four general “missingness mechanisms,” moving from the simplest to the most general.\n\n<br>\n\n**Suppose you are modelling weight (Y) as a function of sex (X). Some respondents wouldn't disclose their weight, so you are missing some values for Y. There are three possible mechanisms for the nondisclosure:**\n\n1. **Missingness Completely At Random ( MCAR):** Missing completely at random (MCAR) is the only missing data mechanism that can actually be verified. When we say data are missing completely at random, we mean that the missingness has nothing to do with the person being studied. For example, a questionnaire might be lost in the post, or a blood sample might be damaged in the lab. Of course, this is not **completely random**, but the underlying idea is the missing data is not related to the subject of the missing data. [reference](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/4/6502/files/2018/06/mcartest-zlxtj7.pdf)\n\n   There may be no particular reason at all why some respondents told you their weights and others didn't. That is, the probability that Y is missing may has no relationship to X or Y. In this case our data is missing completely at random (MCAR).\n\n<br>\n\n\n2. **Missing At Random (MAR):** Missing at random (MAR) means that the missingness can be explained by variables on which you have full information. It's not a testable assumption, but there are cases where it is reasonable vs. not.\n\n   For example, take political opinion polls. Many people refuse to answer. If you assume that the reasons people refuse to answer are entirely based on demographics, and if you have those demographics on each person, then the data is MAR. It is known that some of the reasons why people refuse to answer can be based on demographics (for instance, people at both low and high incomes are less likely to answer than those in the middle), but there's really no way to know if that is the full explanation.\n\n   So, the question becomes \"is it full enough?\". Often, methods like multiple imputation work better than other methods as long as the data isn't very missing not at random. [reference](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23090/distinguishing-missing-at-random-mar-from-missing-completely-at-random-mcar)\n\n   One sex may be less likely to disclose its weight. That is, the probability that Y is missing depends only on the value of X. Such data are missing at random (MAR).\n\n<br>\n\n3. **Missing Not At Random (MNAR):** Heavy (or light) people may be less likely to disclose their weight. That is, the probability that Y is missing depends on the unobserved value of Y itself. Such data are not missing at random or missing not at random (MNAR) and requires attention or else it will heavily bias your inference.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Possible solutions to deal with missing values in Continuous Variables (Refer to https://www.kaggle.com/volhaleusha/titanic-tutorial-encoding-feature-eng-81-8#Part-4:-Explore-Target-Variable):**\n\n1. Complete Case Analysis CCA (discard observations where any value is missing in any variable) - doesn't work if there are many features missing or on small datasets. \n    <br>\n    \n2. Mean and median imputation (substitute missing values with mean feature value (for Gaussian features) and median (if a variable is not Gaussian) \n    - normally good strategy if data is missing completely at random\n    - but if there is a dependency between why data is missing and target it is better to additionally create a separate variable to capture NAs\n    - changes the original distribution of variable and can distort covariance with other variables $\\to$ if too much can influence prediction in a negative way\n    \n      <br>\n      \n3. Random sampling imputation (to fill NAs - take a random observation from available observation)\n    - preserves the original distribution of data, but can create randomness - treatment of the same sample differently or unfair\n    \n      <br>\n      \n4. Adding a separate variable to capture NAs \n    - useful in situations when data is not missing at random and there is some connection on why data is missing with a target or other variables\n    - expands feature space as creates an additional feature \n    \n      <br>\n      \n5. End of distribution imputation (replace NAs with values that are at the far end of the distribution)\n    - shows the importance of missingness\n    - but if missingness is not important can mask predictive power and distorts the original distribution\n    \n      <br>\n      \n6. Arbitrary value imputation (substitute with value away from other values in the variable -999, 999)\n    - captures the importance of missing value\n    - but creates outlier (it doesn't matter for trees)\n    \n      <br>\n      \n7. Build a model to impute missing values: KNN, linear regression, etc.\n    - a very good estimate of missing data\n    - but it can be a problem because prediction usually is too good and doesn't match reality\n\n<br>\n\n**Possible solutions to deal with missing values in categorical variables:**\n1. CCA \n    - for pros and cons refer above\n2. Random sample imputation\n3. Adding a separate variable to capture NAs\n4. Adding a separate category to capture NAs\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n1. If the data is MCAR:\n\n   i) Complete case analysis is valid.\n\n   ii) Mulitple imputation or any other imputation method is valid.\n    \n<br>\n\n2. If the data is MAR:\n\n   i) Some complete cases analyses are valid under weaker assumptions than MCAR. E.g. linear regression is unbiased if missingness is independent of the response, conditional on the predictors.\n\n   ii) Multiple imputation is valid (it is biased, but the bias is negligible).\n    \n<br>\n\n3. If the data is MNAR:\n\n   i) You must model the missingness explicitly; jointly modeling the response and missingness.\n\n   ii) In some specific cases (e.g. survival analysis), MNAR data (e.g. censored data) is handled appropriately.\n\n   iii) Generally, we assume MAR whenever possible just to avoid this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nBesides referencing to some very good kagglers, I also accumulated some more good links to refer to:   \n1.

This is confusing, to say the very least, as a newbie, I googled up and see some answers to this:\n\n<br>\n\nThe division between training and test set is an attempt to replicate the situation where you have past information and are building a model which you will test on future as-yet unknown information: the training set takes the place of the past and the test set takes the place of the future, so you only get to test your trained model once.\n\n<br>\n\nKeeping the past/future analogy in mind, this means anything you do to pre-process or process your data, such as imputing missing values, you should do on the training set alone. You can then remember what you did to your training set if your test set also needs pre-processing or imputing, so that you do it the same way on both sets.\n\n<br>\n\nIf you use the test data to affect the training data, then the test data is being used to build your model, so it ceases to be test data and will not provide a fair test of your model. You risk overfitting, and it was to discourage this that you separated out the test data in the first place.\n\n<br>\n\nSo personally, given a situation where you want to perform, say, median imputation, I would strongly recommend to do it on the training and test set separately, instead of combining the two sets and do a median imputation on it.\n\n**Another reasonable question that follows from the above**\n\nWhat if the missing values only happen in the test set and not in the training set. What should we do then?

You may run the analysis both with and without it, but you should state in at least a footnote the dropping of any such data points and how the results changed.\n\n<br>\n\n- If the outlier creates a significant association, you should drop the outlier and should not report any significance from your analysis.\n\n<br>\n\n**In general, one can always be careful and analyse the model with and without the outliers.

For example, if we have detect_outliers(train, 2, [\"Age\", \"SibSp\", \"Parch\", \"Fare\"]), it means that we are looking at the data set called train and the columns involved are age, sibsp, parch and fare. However, if there is this guy called John and his age is 100, he definitely will be flagged out as an outlier , but is it fair to just consider John as an outlier just because he is old? So the author of the kernel that I linked earlier defines an outlier iff the person has more than 2 outliers at any one time. For instance, we only consider John as an outlier if he has n>2 outliers on him at the same time. For we find that John has age 100 and sibsp = 30  and fare as 1000000, and we have find out that these values of John are all outliers in its own right, then John has > n =2 columns as outliers, so then only can we consider john as an outlier. \n<br>\n\n2. outliers_indices = [] creates an empty list which we will use later.\n<br>\n\n3. for col in features: for col in features: ........(a bunch of code) means the below: let features be ['Age,'SibSp',...], for  each col, or rather for each element in features, we do the following bunch of code, starting from Age -- finish age and loop back to the start and do SibSp etc.\n\n    For the first loop, the column we iterate through is age. In age, we find the lower quartile and upper quartile of age and the IQR, making sure we ignore NAN values by np.nanpercentile (usually people use np.percentile, take note and in that case it is troublesome because if we do not ignore nan values, the lower bound and upperbound for age will both be nan because there are too many nan values.)\n    \n    outlier_step = 1.5 times IQR and whenever age is less than Q1- outlierstep or more than Q3+ outlierstep. So the code outlier_list_col returns column vector of row numbers whose ages are outliers. When printed out this line, we have \nInt64Index([33, 54, 96, 116, 280, 456, 493, 630, 672, 745, 851], dtype='int64'), meaning row 33, 54, 96... are the rows of Age being an outlier.\n<br>\n\n4. Also at this step, you can print(col,Q1-outlier_step,Q3+outlier_step) and return the range of outlier for each col.\n<br>\n\n5. Now onto the next code,  outliers_indices.extend(outlier_list_col), recall the first line we have an empty list for outliers_indices =[]. Now we put each element in the column vector of row number index for age into the empty list []. So for example, row 33 and 54 are age outliers, then the outliers_indices = [33,54]; Now we have finished 1 loop, loop back again\nbut for the next column sibsp, rinse and repeat until the end of columns. For example, John is row 33, and he is outlier for age and sibsp and fare. so the final outliers_indices.extend will return a list like [33,.....,33,......,33.....] with 33 appearing 3 times. \n<br>\n\n6. We have finished with the loops! Now we look at the next code. outliers_indices = Counter(outliers_indices)\nCounter function gives you a dictionary, same example, Ivan is row number 7. So in the dictionary returned by counter, we will see something like {7:3,.......} where 7:3 is key value pair meaning, row 7 occured 3 times in the old list. This is important to know because we only want to have people who have >2 outliers as an OUTLIER. Another way is just to type list(enumerate(outliers_indices)).\n<br>\n\n7. multiple_outliers = list(k for k, v in outliers_indices.items() if v > n) \n\n    outliers_indices is a dictionary for eg {7:3, 2:1, 8:4} , \n\n    outliers_indices.items() is a list of key value tuples like [(7,3),(2,1),(8,4)]\n\n    for item in outliers_indices.items() = [(7,3),(2,1),(8,4)] it will loop over each tuple, first loop item will be (7,3)\n    second loop will be (2,1). \n\n    Now let us unpack the tuple instead of looping over the tuples because we are interested in the key value. k is first, v is second value, return a list of keys for which the corresponding value v is more than n, in which case n = 2 here.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Attention**\n\nWe shall investigate why the upper and lower bound of parch is both 0.

It is a very basic idea and there is no hard and fast rule which encoding method to use for every question. But in general, that is a rules of thumb to follow: But always bear in mind not to employ any method blindly.\n\nAlways remember, you have to decide what encoding method to use before you run the model. For example, before you use random forest algorithm, you have to process the data into something the computer can understand. Here we introduce 2 ways of encoding.\n\n---\n\n- **Label Encoding:** For example, there is this feature called Embarked in our dataset, represented by \"S\", \"C\", \"Q\". Now the computer only likes to work with numbers, and as a result we need to convert S, C, Q into numbers. We can simply label $$S = 0, C = 1, Q = 2$$ and this is called Label Encoding (simply assigning numbers to the categorical variable in a sequential manner).\n\n    However, Label Encoding has a big caveat, whenever you use this encoding method, the Embarked category now has a inherent ordered relationship; Signifying that C = 1 has more weight than S = 0, and Q = 2 has more weight than C = 1 and S = 0. \n\n   The problem with this is when an algorithm (for eg, a logistic classification model makes USE OF THE WEIGHT in their calculation, and this is disastrous). \n\n   The algorithm learns: \n   \n   $$\\text{Prediction_of_survival_rate = weight_of_embarked * embarked + weight_of_gender * gender + ...... + bias}$$\n   \n   Now if you want to predict person A's survival rate based on the label encoding of where he/she embarked, you will have a problem. \n   \n   If person A comes from Southampton, and person B comes from Queenstown, both are of the same gender (Male) and let weight_of_embarked = 10, weight_of_gender = 20.\n   \n   Then the Prediction_of_survival_rate for person A = 10 * 0 + $\\epsilon$ = $\\epsilon$ and the Prediction_of_survival_rate for person B = 10 * 2 + $\\epsilon$  = 20 + $\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a positive number (representing weight_of_gender * gender but we know that the value for both is the same).\n   \n   So naturally, our model is gonna say that person B has a much higher survival rate than person A. I believe one can already get a feel of what is going wrong here. The caveat of Label Encoding is that we unknowingly assigned a hierarcy to each variable - signifying that an ordered relationship will not work properly in this situation. There are exceptions however, decision tree model is invariant to the encoding's order, so it may be fine to use Label Encoder, the rule of thumb is you have to know your algorithm does not depend on the \"number\" that is encoded.\n\n        if embarked == 0 (aka = S) then\n            do this decision\n        elif embarked == 1 (aka = C) then\n            do that decision\n        elif embarked == 2 (aka = Q) then\n            do last decision\n  \n    In the above example, we see that it does not matter what the embarked is encoded as, as it does not affect the end result.\n\n---\n\n- **One Hot Encoding**\n\n[ref](https://medium.com/@michaeldelsole/what-is-one-hot-encoding-and-how-to-do-it-f0ae272f1179)\n\nInitially, apple is labeled 1, chicken labeled as 2, broccoli labeled as 3. The idea now is that under the food name column, there are 3 categories, namely, apple, chicken and broccoli. Now for each category, we create an additional binary column for each category.\n\n<br>\n\nSo back to our Titanic example, the column name (feature) is Embarked, with 3 categories inside, S, C and Q. Now with one hot encoding, the distance for S, C and Q are equal. \n\n<br>\n\nS: [1,0,0]\n\nC: [0,1,0]\n\nQ: [0,0,1]\n\nSo if we treat each of the above as a column vector, the distance between each pair of cities/Embarked is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n<br>\n\n\n4. There is some caveats for one hot encoding. One is for the Sklearn package in python, Sklearn’s one hot encoder does not actually know how to convert categories to numbers, it only knows how to convert numbers to binary. We have to use the labelencoder first to convert categories to numbers.\n\n    Also recognize that while one hot encoding reduces noise in your data that would have otherwise been cause by incorrect ordinal relationships, it also greatly increases the dimensionality of your data. High dimensionality has its own set of problems in machine learning, such as the curse of dimensionality. For example, if we were to think that ticket ID is important for our study, then there are literally 891 categories in the ticket ID feature. That would mean 891 new attributes/features after one hot encoding.\n<br>\n\n5. A general rule of thumb for Label Encoder vs One Hot encoder is as follows:\n\n    i) If the categorical features are ordinal ones, use label encoder. For example, if I were to bin the Fare feature into category features such as: Cheap price, Normal price, Expensive price. Then it does make sense to say cheap = 0, normal = 1 and expensive = 2. However do note that LabelEncoder does not know what does 'cheap', 'normal' and 'expensive' mean. So it just assigns labels in order of appearance.\n\n    ii) If non-ordinal relation, use one hot encoder.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will convert categorical data to dummy variables for mathematical analysis. There are multiple ways to encode categorical variables; we will use the sklearn and pandas functions.

Then, when you have a good performance on the validation part of the training data and are happy with your model, you can apply the model to the test data and submit your predicted survival values for the test.

But do try and fiddle around with the 4 new variables I created, namely, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#In this part, we will do the train test split.\n\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    original_train_set_without_survived, orginal_train_set_with_only_survived, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\nprint(x_train.shape, y_train.shape)\nprint(x_test.shape, y_test.shape)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So the idea is we split our training data into 4 datasets, x_train means the training set without the outcome values (no survived column), x_train will serve as the training set. Now y_train set is the set of survived values corresponding to the x_train set. Similarly, we have **x_test which is also extracted from the training set (PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION THAT x_test IS NOT REFERRING TO THE TEST SET given to us)**, but serving the purpose as test set here. And y_test set is the set of survived values corresponding to the x_test set.\n\n<br>\n\nNow train_size = 0.8, test_size = 0.2 just means we split the data set into 80 percent of training data, and 20 percent test data.\n\n<br>\n\nRandom_state is basically used for reproducing your problem the same every time it is run. If you do not use a randomstate in traintestsplit, every time you make the split you might get a different set of train and test data points and will not help you in debugging in case you get an issue. Note, it does not matter which integer value you use for random state, as long as you set it to one integer value and keep to it throughout.\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, there are many ways to **split** dataset, and sometimes other ways are superior. For example cross validation is a better way in general. However, in **Time Series** problems, train-test split or train-test-validation split might just prove to be superior because why would you care about errors in the past? You should care about errors you would make in the future. In that sense, you want to partition your dataset in past TS datapoints and the most current datapoints and perform MSE or Log Loss ( depending on whether this is classification or regression ) to evaluate how well your model can predict into the future.\n\n<br>\n\n\n**Cross Validation**\n\nWe talk about K-Fold Cross Validation (CV) first, note that there are many cross validation methods. But we have to start simple and talk about the easiest but also an efficient one here. K-Fold CV is literally performing train test split numerous times (or rather k times), but on different train test splits. If you have a data set of 1000, and set k = 10, then your dataset will be divided into 10 folds of dataset, with dataset 1 to dataset 10 each having 100 data inside. We will take dataset 1 to 9 as the \"training set\" and dataset 10 as the \"test set\" and perform the model on it, then we take dataset 1 to 8 and dataset 10 as the training set and let dataset 9 be the test set and perform the model on it. We do this iteratively (?) for 10 times until each dataset has been part of the training set. We will get 10 outputs of accuracy values and we take the average of them to be the final accuracy value.\n\n<br>\n\nCross-validation is usually the preferred method because it gives your model the opportunity to train on multiple train-test splits. This gives you a better indication of how well your model will perform on unseen data.

For example, if our accuracy for each of the folds is as follows: [0.9, 0.88, 0.9, 0.92, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.91, 0.9, 0.88], then this is a bit weird because there are 2 folds in which our accuracy is significantly lower, this should raise an alarm and one should try to find out the reason why or even have to give up such algorithms with such high variances in between accuracies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"k_fold = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=0)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x = original_train_set_without_survived\ny = orginal_train_set_with_only_survived","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Now remember our feature scaling earlier on train test split?**\n\nHowever, be very careful that in K-Fold Cross Validation, we do not feature scale separately, this is because as explained earlier, in K-Fold we want to plug in the entire training set.

And to make the example simple, we have 1000 data set in which we achieved an 80% accuracy, that is we predicted 800/1000 correctly. This 80% accuracy seems reasonable, but however it can still be extremely bad if we have many False Positives or False Negatives. In our case, let's say we have exactly 500 people who died and 500 people who lived - Our algorithm predicts 500/500 correctly for those people who survived, however only 300/500 correctly for those who died. Yes, the total accuracy does add up to 80 percent and it looks good on paper, but we realised that this algorithm is extremely incapable of prediction for people who died, and that can be a big problem because in reality, we may have say, 900 people who died and 100 who survived, one can imagine how disastrous it can be if we applied the algorithm and it will give you a much lower total accuracy rate!\n\n<br>\n\nWe shall explore some popular metrics to further ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE of the model - An extension to evaluate how accurate the model performs.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We come up with a function called Acc_score that gives the mean of all cross validated scores through the CV K-Fold.\n\n<br>\n\nNote that cross_val_score is a in-built function which requires you to input the model you use, the dataset to train/fit without the output variable, which is our original_train_set_without_survived = x.

First and foremost, in number 1 I will have an extract from the classical machine learning book \"An Introduction to Statistics\" on why sometimes linear regression cannot work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. We have stated that linear regression is not appropriate in the case of a qualitative response. Why not? Suppose that we are trying to predict the medical condition of a patient in the emergency room on the basis of her symptoms. In this simplified example, there are three possible diagnoses: stroke, drug overdose, and epileptic seizure. We could consider encoding these values as a quantitative response variable, $Y$, as follows: \n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}  \n       1, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       2, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n       3, & \\text{if epileptic seizure}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   Using this coding, least squares could be used to fit a linear regression model to predict $Y$ on the basis of a set of predictors $X_{1}$, . . . , $X_{p}$. Unfortunately, this coding implies an ordering on the outcomes, putting drug overdose in between stroke and epileptic seizure, and insisting that the difference between stroke and drug overdose is the same as the difference between drug overdose and epileptic seizure. In practice there is no particular reason that this needs to be the case. For instance, one could choose an\n    equally reasonable coding,\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       1, & \\text{if epileptic seizure}\\\\\n       2, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       3, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n\n   which would imply a totally different relationship among the three conditions. Each of these codings would produce fundamentally different linear models that would ultimately lead to different sets of predictions on test observations.\n\n   If the response variable's values did take on a natural ordering, such as mild, moderate, and severe, and we felt the gap between mild and moderate was similar to the gap between moderate and severe, then a 1, 2, 3 coding would be reasonable. Unfortunately, in general there is no natural way to convert a qualitative response variable with more than two levels into a quantitative response that is ready for linear regression.\n\n   For a binary (two level) qualitative response, the situation is better. For instance, perhaps there are only two possibilities for the patient's medical condition: stroke and drug overdose. We could then potentially use the dummy variable approach to code the response as follows:\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       0, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       1, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   We could then fit a linear regression to this binary response, and predict drug overdose if $\\hat{Y}>0.5$ and stroke otherwise. In the binary case it is not hard to show that even if we flip the above coding, linear regression will produce the same final predictions.\n\n   For a binary response with a $0-1$ coding as above, regression by least squares does make sense; it can be shown that the $X\\hat{\\beta}$ obtained using linear regression is in fact an estimate of $\\text{Pr}(\\text{Drug Overdoes}~|~X)$ in this special case. However, if we use linear regression, some of our estimates might be outside the $[0$, 1$]$ interval , making them hard to interpret as probabilities!\n\n   However, the dummy variable approach cannot be easily extended to accommodate qualitative responses with more than **two levels!!!** For these reasons, it is preferable to use a classification method that is truly suited for qualitative response values, such as the ones presented next.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2. Now we recall back in linear regression, we have independent input/variables $X$ and we seek a response/output variable $Y$. However in logistic regression, our output is in the form of a categorical variable. In our simple tutorial we will only be considering a binary output binary coded as 0 and 1. \n\n   As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we cannot use linear regression to predict a categorical output even if the categorical output is coded as numerical values, especially in such a classification problem with many levels in a categorical variable. As a result, we need to come up with a slightly different **hypothesis** to model our relationship for $X$ and $Y$.\n\n   As with any modelling, there should be a \"formula\" between the $X$ and the $Y$. However, we have already established it is not easy to obtain an direct equation between $X$ and $Y$. Instead, in logistic regression, we are more interested in having a relation between $X$ and $P(Y = 1 ~|~ X)$. One should immediately be asking, what and why is $P(Y=1~|~X)$? Let me give you an intuition by the following example.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"3. **Example**: We are trying to predict if a person has malignant tumor or not based on some inputs such as \"Tumor Size\" and etc. For simplicity sake, we only deal with one variable: The \"Tumor Size\" $X$. \n\n   Our output $Y$ is basically encoded as a binary class where **Yes it is Malignant Tumor** stands for 1 and **No it is not a Malignant Tumor** stands for 0. Consider the data set above, where the response \"$Y$ = Malignant\" falls into one of two categories, Yes (1) or No (0). As mentioned in the previous paragraph, rather than modeling this response $Y$ directly with $X$, logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category. One can see the from the below figure, the first row says that the tumour size is 1 cm and our data says that the patient's tumour is not malignant (thank god!). But as we said, we want the probability of the tumour being malignant **given** $X = 1$cm. So we write down the probability as shown below (just get this intuition first and don't wonder how are we going to find the probability first!).\n\n    ![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghnreigns/imagesss/master/logistic-8.jpg)\n\n   For this, in a simple (one variable only) logistic regression model, we can define our output $Y$ as a probability defined as $$P(Y=1~|~ X)$$\n    \n   **So to reiterate, instead of modelling our $Y$ directly with $X$, we aim to find a model that can model the probability of $Y$ given $X$.** But why? How does getting a probability help us? Although it should be obvious that $P(Y=1~|~X)$ should fall in between $0$ and $1$ since it is a probability, **but** it does not answer our question of whether you are in class 1 or 0 because ultimately, we are interested in finding out our output value which is either a 1 or a 0.\n\n   I DO NOT CARE if you told me you found that  $P(Y=1~|~X =1.1 \\text{ cm}) = 0.2349538$ which is neither 0 or 1? So this is where **classification threshold** comes in. You need to pre-define a threshold (default is usually 0.5). As a result, if we use a classification threshold of 0.5, then we will predict a $Y = \\text{Yes } (1)$ for any $P(Y=1|~X) > 0.5$. To write it more compactly, we define the following indicator function. (For more experienced peeps, there is connection with AUC,ROC curves here as well!)\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       1, & \\text{if $P(Y=1~|~X) \\geq 0.5$}\\\\\n       0, & \\text{if $P(Y=1~|~X < 0.5$}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   As a result if your tumour size is 1.1 cm, then the probability of your tumour is malignant is $0.2349538$, which is less than 0.5 and we predict your as a No (not malignant). However, the threshold is there for a reason, usually, in medical and healthcare industry, we tend to be more conservative with our predictions as we have 0 tolerance for False Negatives. We rather give you a false alarm than to classify you as No Malignancy when in fact you are already at the last stage of your life. So we can tune and change our threshold to something like $P(Y=1~|~X) >0.1$ and in this case, $0.2349538$ will be in the Yes class. \n\n   I know we are going off the tracks, but I hope I have provided you with some intuition on how modelling the $P(Y=1~|~X)$ as a function of $X$ makes sense here.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"4. **Hypothesizing and Modelling the Logistic Function:** For simplicity we call our function $P(Y=1~|~ X)$ as the function $p(X)$ and we seek to find a relationship between $p(X)$ and $X$. Although we have gone through a lot of ideas just now, it would be meaningless if we cannot find a suitable function (equation) to model $p(X)$ and $X$. \n\n   **Hypothesis 1: The Linear Hypothesis**\n\n   Hmm, so we got quite some success hypothesizing linear regression models with linear functions, can we try that too on $p(X)$ and $X$? Consider that we \"guess/hypothesize\" that $p(X)$ have a **linear relationship** with $X$ as follows: \n\n    $$p(X) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X$$\n\n   However the problem with this modelling is that for very large Tumour sizes $X$, say $X=10 \\text{ cm}$, then our $p(X)$ may take values greater than $1$. And for extremely small Tumour sizes $X$, say those very small benign lumps, which may be $X=0.05 \\text{ cm}$ in size, then $p(X)$ may take negative values. In any case, no matter how likely or unlikely one is to find his/her tumour to be malignant, how big or small the tumour size is, our $p(X)$ should only output values between $0$ and $1$ because $p(X)$ is a probability. Hence our linear model may be accurate to a certain extent, but not sensible.\n\n   **Hypothesis 2**\n\n   Instead of the linear hypothesis, we come up with another one, recall that we learnt that probability and odds have similar definition. And recall that $$\\text{odds} = \\dfrac{P(Y=1~|~X)}{1-P(Y=1~|~X)}$$\n\n   So why not model the odds against $X$? If we can successfully do that, then we can easily get the probability $P(Y=1~|~X)$ since odds and probability are in a if and only if relationship. So let us try: $$\\text{odds} = \\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$$\n\n   But ALAS! We soon realise that the odds can only take on values from $0$ to $\\infty$, but the problem still exists for the $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$ since some $X$ values can output negative values.\n\n   But we are close, and if one has **some** mathematical backgrounds, then we know that if we take the log or ln of $\\text{odds}$ then we can have the desired results.\n\n   **Hypothesis 3: The Chosen one**\n\n   If we finally consider the modelling of the logarithm of the odds, against the variable $X$, where we still assume a linear relationship, then we may be good to go because the logarithm of the odds gives a range of $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ and matches well with $\\beta_0+\\beta_1X$.      \n\n   With this we have achieved a regression model, with the output of the model being the logarithm or ln of the odds. i.e: the modelled equation is as follows:\n\n    $$\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X$$\n\n   The main reason we reach this step is because both sides of the equation can take in the same range, and thus makes more mathematical sense now. We have yet to estimate or found what the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$ are. This is just a logical and sound hypothesis.\n\n   **Recovering the Logistic Function from log odds**\n\n   So in the previous paragraph we have settled on a hypothesis that there is a **linear relationship** between the predictor variable $X$ and the **log-odds** of the event that $Y=1$. However, do not forget what our original aim is, we modelled log odds against $X$ simply because the relationship can be mathematically justified, we ultimately want to find the probability of $Y=1$ given $X$. And that is easy, by some reverse engineering, once $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$ are fixed, we do some manipulation:\n\n    \n$$\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X \\iff  \\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = \\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}   \\iff p(X)  = \\dfrac{\\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}{\\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}+1} \\iff p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$\n\n\n   **Given the log odd mode (logit model actually), we can recover the probability of $Y=1$ given $X$ for each $X$.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"5.  **Important - The workflow process of Logistic Regression**\n\n    - Given an indepedent variable $X$, we aim to predict a binary dependent variable $Y$.\n\n    - It is not easy to model a relationship between $X$ and $Y$ directly, instead, we find the probability of $Y = 1$ given $X$ instead. Imagine we are in the shoes of the famous statistician DR Cox in the year 1958, we are building logistic regression from scratch, and we tried to hypothesize that the probability $p(X) = P(Y=1~|~X)$ can be modelled the same way as **linear regression?** But soon realised that modelling $p(X) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X$ is not good since its range gives values out of $[0,1]$. In order to overcome this we can make a transformation and fit the sigmoid/logistic function which forces the output $p(X)$ to be in $[0,1]$.\n\n    - Since the transformation may not be intuitive, I have made a simple explanation above, and showed steps on how to model $P(X)$ as a sigmoid function.\n\n        Sigmoid in logistic regression:\n\n    $$p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$\n\n    - So, we have effectively build a model, and in fact it is a probabilistic model behaving as a bernoulli distribution. To recover the probability $p(X)$, we have to estimate the coefficients (parameters) in $$p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$ and we use a method called **Maximum Likelihood (I will do a part 2 on this as it is also a big topic)**.\n\n    - Once we recover the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$, we can simply plug in the coefficients and the respective values of $X$ to get $p(X)$. \n\n    - Once we get the $p(X)$, we can define a indicator function as our classification threshold (mentioned earlier) and subsequently, get all the values of $Y$.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 8) Part 2: Maximum Likelihood  <a id=\"ls2\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First you need to be very clear about what a **probability distribution is.** Consider that we have 10 students and we model their marks where the full marks of the test is 16/16. Define a random variable $X$ where $X$ represents the marks of each student. Assume further that this **random variable** $X$ is following a **normal distribution** with $\\mu = 11$ and $\\sigma = 3$, can we find the probability distribution for the marks of the whole cohort (10 students)? Yes we can, because we have the parameters. If you do not know what is the meaning of parameters, please go revise on it, it is very important for you to understand that the **parameter** decides the probability distribution of any model. \n\nRecall the general formula for the pdf of the normal distribution is $$f(X = x) = \\dfrac{e^{-(x-\\mu)^2}/(2\\sigma^2)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$$\nand in normal distribution once we have the mean and standard deviation of the dataset, we can recover the whole pdf of the model, hence the mean and standard deviation are our parameters.  So let us say we want to find $P(11 < X < 13~|~\\mu = 11, \\sigma = 3)$, we can easily find it to be around $0.31 = 31\\%$, we can basically find any probabilities **as long as we are given the parameters**. So, **we must have the correct mindset that,** probability density functions (or pmf alike) are legitimate functions that takes in any $X = x$ and outputs the probability of this $x$ **happening**. (Of course in continuous distribution we are usually only interested in the range of $x$, but for the purpose of intuition, we do not need to be so pedantic).\n\n**Likelihood Function**\n\nHowever, in the real world setting, more often than not, we have the data $X$, like we have conveniently the scores of all the 10 students above, which **could be a random sample taken** from the whole school's population. Now we are tasked to find the probability distribution of the whole population (say 10,000 students), and we would have calculate it ever so easily **if we knew what the parameters were!?** Unfortunately we do not have the true parameters.\n\nOur main motivation now is to find the **parameter**, because without it, we cannot complete the task of finding the distribution of the population. We can never know the real/true parameter $\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)$, but we can obtain a good estimator of it, by making use of the data that we do have! In this scenario we were given 10 data points (in real life it is usually much more), say the 10 data points are $$\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]$$\n\nSo we do a sleight of hand using our original **probability density function**, $P(X = x~|~ \\theta)$. Instead of being a function of $X = x$ where $\\theta$ is known, we instead let $X = x$ be fixed, and let $\\theta$ be the variable now. The idea is that this function now is **NO LONGER a function of** $X=x$, and is instead a function of $\\theta$, where it takes in all possible values of $\\theta$, and outputs a value called the \\textbf{likelihood value.} So now, in a less informal way, our new function looks like $$P(\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]~|~ \\theta)$$ and it means **what is the probability of OBSERVING these data points, given different values of theta.** One needs to plot the graph of likelihood out to get a better idea (Wikipedia).  \n\nSo imagine our function (plot likelihood value vs parameter) has a local/global maximum, and that maximum is what we are finding ultimately. Because it is reasonable for us to believe that, the **parameter** that gives us the maximum value of $P(\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]~|~ \\theta)$ will suggest that **given these 10 data points**, this $\\theta$ that we just found, gives us the highest **likelihood/probability** that these 10 points are actually observed. \n\nWe formally define this function to be $$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta~|~ X = x) = P(X = x~|~\\theta) $$\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that even those the likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}$ and the probability function $P$ have the exact same form, they are fundamentally different in which one is a function of the parameter $\\theta$, and the other is a function of the data points $X = x$.\n\n**Maximizing the likelihood function**\n\nMany of us may not have rigourous mathematical background, and hence when I said we are trying to find the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes $\\mathcal{L}$, we might be stunned, indeed, the most intuitive way is to try out every possible theta and see which theta gives us the highest value; or if you can try differentiating $\\mathcal{L}$ and set the derivative to $0$ to solve for $\\theta$. In any case, our intuition is to maximize this function. We will illustrate the idea of maximum likelihood with a simple example below.\n\n**Example**\n\nInspired and credits to [Jonny Brooks-Bartlett](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-concepts-explained-maximum-likelihood-estimation-c7b4342fdbb1) as the example is almost similar.\n\n- Let's say we have a population of 1000 students and a random sample of 3 university students are taken with their respective marks for a Machine learning test. The data are distributed below in python (generate some data of 3 students marks). \n    \n- First, we always have to come up with a hypothesized model first, and in this case, based on these 3 sample data points, we make a simple plot and since the plot looks somewhat normal, we hypothesize that our model should be of a normal distribution (do be reminded this is just for illustration, 3 points may be too little for us to hypothesize a model in many scenarios).\n    \n- Our aim is to come up with a normal distribution for this 1000 students marks. In order to do that, we need to find the parameters and recall that in normal distribution, our parameters are the mean $\\mu$ and the standard deviation  $\\sigma$. So we have to find the best parameters that best describe our observed 3 sample points.\n    \n- Note that from our previous section, we know that we just need to maximize the likelihood function given by $$\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)~|~ X = [9,9.5,11]\\right) = P\\left(X = [9,9.5,11]~;~ \\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)\\right)$$\n\n- Here the author made a very good point that we shall use ; instead of | to indicate probability function. However some people like to use | as probability function can be described in a conditional way.\n    \n- And since our assumption that this 3 data points are independent of each other, our joint pdf equation can be simplified to \n    \n    \n$$P\\left(X = [9,9.5,11]~;~ \\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)\\right) = P(9;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) \\cdot P(9.5;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) \\cdot  P(11;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(9-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(9.5-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(11-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)~~~~~~~~(2.1)$$\n\nEquation 2.1 above is the joint probability of observing these 3 points and is a function of the parameters, so we suffice to find the parameters that maximize this function. So the intuition is to differentiate equation 2.1 and set it to 0, and solve for the parameter $\\theta$.\n\n- However, the expression in 2.1 is very difficult to differentiate, and that is why it is very common to see we take log/ln on both sides of the expression \n\n$\\ln\\mathcal{L} = \\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(9-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(9.5-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(11-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]$\n\nand instead maximize the new log-likelihood function instead. But some may be confused, when we solve the \\textbf{parameters} for the above equation, will our parameter still be the one that actually maximizes our equation 2.1? Yes, it does, the proof can be found here (for those who are curious). [proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/647835/why-does-finding-the-x-that-maximizes-lnfx-is-the-same-as-finding-the#_=_)\n\n- We simplify the above $\\ln\\mathcal{L}$ function to get $$\\ln\\mathcal{L} = -3\\ln(\\sigma)-1.5\\ln(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(9-\\mu)^2+(9.5-\\mu)^2+(11-\\mu)^2\\right]~~~(2.2)$$\n\n- We take the partial derivatives with respect to $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ respectively and set to $0$ to solve equation 2.2, thereby getting our $\\theta$.\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathcal{L})}{\\partial \\mu} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma^2}[9+9.5+11-3\\mu] = 0 \\implies \\mu = 9.833$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathcal{L})}{\\partial \\sigma} = -\\dfrac{3}{\\sigma} + 4\\sigma^{-3}\\left[(9-\\mu)^2+(9.5-\\mu)^2+(11-\\mu)^2\\right] =0 \\implies \\sigma = 1.7$$\n\n- So now we have found the estimate of the real parameter of the population, and we can therefore infer that our populations' probability density function.\n\n- However, we are not really done yet, this example was easy and therefore can be calculated with hand. In reality, there is no closed form solution expression for the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood function, so that an iterative process must be used instead; for example Newton's method. This process begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this revision until no more improvement is made, at which point the process is said to have converged.(Wikipedia)\n\n**It is important to realise that if convergence for the model is not reached, the coefficients/parameters you obtained may not be meaningful. Therefore, certain assumptions need to be fulfilled for logistic regression.**\n\n**Assumptions of logistic regression and Regularization will be mentioned in part III, which is also the final part of the Logistic Regression Trilogy**.
