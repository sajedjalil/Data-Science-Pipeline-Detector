How git works?***<span>\n<a id=\"2.1\"></a>\n**git** - is a system that allows you to control the versions of your deployment or your project. Imagine that you are developing your project, everything works fine for a while, but later you find an error that was not fixed at the very beginning. Git will help you avoid such problems.\n    \n> Not to be confused with gitub gitlab and etc!\n    \n\nGit also allows you to merge a project if you work in a team. Resources such as github, gitlab already help here.\n    \n**How the Version Control System works?**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/b1mtQzc/2022-04-04-185835.png)\n \n**How the git works?**\n        \n![](https://i.ibb.co/PMy5vyr/image.png)\n    \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n## <span style=\"color:#011936;\">***2.2. Initial configuration setup***<span>\n<a id=\"2.2\"></a>\n    \n> You can train skills with git here > https://learngitbranching.js.org\n    \nSo after you install git (not about github, gitlab)  \nYou need to prepare your project, repository.  \n1. config   \n    a. configuration level    \n        * --local\n        * --global\n        * --system\n    b. user.name  \n    c. user.email  \n    \nFor example, you need to choose your project path. Start 'git Bash here'.   \nNext step is make repository:  \n    `$ git init`   \nAfter this in your project path was maden `.git` file\n\nSo next make git config and apply configuration level.  \n`local` if settings is apply only for this repository  \n`global` if settings is apply for all repository  \n`system` if settings is apply for all persons of our repository  \n\nWell, we do this.  \n`$ git init --global user.name`  \n`your username`  \n`$ git init --global user.email`  \n`your email`\n\n> Take into account, you need to write username and email of your github or gitlab account if you gonna use this one.\n\nOkey, if we gonna view event history.  \n`$ git log`  \nAnd next way to checkout which one files are changing in the moment or have been changed:  \n`$ git status`  \nStatus can be of two types:  \n1. Tracked\n2. Untracked  \n    a. Modified  \n    b. Commited  \n    \n![](https://i.ibb.co/DMKwhw1/2022-04-04-192535.png)\n\nThis picture is explain how its works in source. Your files placed to staging area after `$ git add <file\\files\\smth> else`, and after this if you do `$ git commit`,will be commited files which placed in staging area.   \n\nYou can also use `$ git show <commit hash/tag/branch>` to checkout changings.  \n    \nIf you want to return to the previous commit you need to use `$ git restore <file_name>`  \n\n> restore will not working if you did `$ git add .`, so you need to use `$ git restore --staged <file_name>` so it has removed from index in staging area and again do `$ git restore <file_name>`\n    \n`$ git diff` is show what`s changed after last commit\n\n`$ git rm <file_name>` is remove file/files (removed local and virtual)  \n    `$ git rm --cached <file_name>` is remove only local\n    \n\n`$ git branch <name_branch>` is make new branch  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/zXvqN8D/2022-04-04-195351.png)    \n`$ git checkout <name_branch>` is checkout to branch  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/ByJLzLG/2022-04-04-195423.png)\n\nSo after commit this look like:  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/ZWdqVRL/2022-04-04-195523.png)\n\nfor example we gonna merge two branch, so this look like:\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TKc9SBs/2022-04-04-195751.png)\n\nWe need to use `$ git merge <name_branch>`\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hx5GY7f/2022-04-04-200239.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n## <span style=\"color:#011936;\">***2.3.
