Numbers are given at the end of each line to make the descriptions easier (eg, # line1)\n\nFirst, we create a class named KaggleMember using the 'class' key word. The bracket symbols '()' are added at the end of the class name. Python allows class definition without adding parentheses (eg, KaggleMember). However, since most programming languages require the addition of parentheses symbols after the class name, the use of parentheses  has been preferred in this class definition\n\nIn the second line, the class variable named kaggle_member_count is defined. Class variables are defined outside of class functions. However, it is a good programming practice to write class variables just below the class name. At the bottom of the KaggleMember class, a class variable defined for learning purposes\n\nConstructor function is defined in line 3. In Python, the constructor function has a special name: __init __ (). Constructor functions are invoked on every instance of the class, and are generally used to assign initial values. In the above example, the constructor function has four different parameters: self, name, surname, level.\n* The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. The word 'self' should be written as the first parameter of each function created in the Python class definition. It is important to note that; The word 'self' can be replaced with another word based on user preference. By convention, this argument is always named self.\n* There are three parameters that come after 'self'. The second and third parameters have no default value. For this reason, these parameters must be sent when the function is called. The fourth parameter has a default value. For this reason, if the fourth parameter is not sent when the function is called, it will get its default value. For the example above, it will take the value None.\n\nIn lines 4, 5, 6 and 8, the initial assignments of instance variables were made with values from the constructor function. Note that when values are assigned to variables, different inputs are transformed into the desired form. This input control is a small example for ** Robustness ** mentioned above.\n\nIn the sixth line, another instance variable is assigned a value. A function has been used for value assignment. The function assigns the value of the 'self.level' variable according to the value of the 'level' parameter.\n\nThe remaining lines contain the functions used.\n\nLet's create object using KaggleMember class\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e992ca1ef1a109097ddbb48d497d5876e7e68b45"},"cell_type":"code","source":"kaggler1=KaggleMember('SERkan','peldek','expert')\nkaggler1.display_member_info()\nkaggler1.display_number_of_member()\nprint()\nkaggler2=KaggleMember('kaan','can', 'grand master')\nkaggler2.display_member_info()\nkaggler1.display_number_of_member()\nprint()\nkaggler3=KaggleMember('Kral','Adam', \"expert\")\nkaggler3.display_member_info()\nkaggler1.display_number_of_member()\n\nprint()\nprint('Following codes check other class variable value ')\nprint(kaggler1.myclass_name)\nprint(kaggler2.myclass_name)\nprint(kaggler3.myclass_name)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ee9f5fe41442f6c467dad6d68ef030a1a7ac1d8f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's examine the codes above.\nThree different KaggleMember objects were created.
