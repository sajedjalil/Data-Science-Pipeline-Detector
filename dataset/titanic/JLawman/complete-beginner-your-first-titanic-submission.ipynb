I have intentionally left lots of room for improvement regarding the model used (currently a simple decision tree classifier). <br><br> The idea of this tutorial is to get you started and have you make the decisions of how to improve your score. At the bottom of the tutorial are challenges which, if you follow them, will significantly improve your score.\n\n\n\n### Steps to complete this tutorial on your own computer:\nThe kernel below can be run in the browser. But if you would like to run the code locally on your own computer, you can follow the steps below.\n\n1. Create a Kaggle account (https://www.kaggle.com/).\n2. Download Titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).<br>\n    a. Download 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'.<br>\n    b. Place both files in a folder named 'input'.<br>\n    c. Place that folder in the same directory as your notebook.\n3. Install [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (follow my [installation tutorial](http://joshlawman.com/getting-set-up-in-jupyter-notebooks-using-anaconda-to-install-the-jupyter-pandas-sklearn-etc/) if you are confused)\n4. Download this kernel as a [notebook](https://github.com/jlawman/Meetup/blob/master/11.7%20Meetup%20-%20Decision%20Trees/Submit%20your%20first%20Kaggle%20prediction%20-%20Titanic%20Dataset.ipynb) with empty cells from my GitHub. If you are new to GitHub go [the repository folder](https://github.com/jlawman/Meetup), click \"Clone or Download\", then unzip the file and pull out the notebook you want.\n5. Run every cell in the notebook (except the optional visualization cells).\n6. Submit CSV containing the predictions.\n7. Try to improve the prediction by using the challenge prompts which are suitable to your level.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"38694da4-2429-40fc-bcc9-e5cc37a14274","_uuid":"b2db902ca75ab79dcefa1c9ebc86cec8051a9b10"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 1.
