In most cases, the most accurate and robust model might be what you're looking for. But sometimes we need to actually get insights from the available data and in these cases transparent, easy to understand models like *Decision Trees* will greatly simplify our task.\n\nIf we need to build a model that will be directly used for some task and **only show it's end results**, then we don't really care about building some kind of \"blackbox\" if it's accurate enough (image or speech recognition for example). That's why advanced techniques such as [*Deep Learning*][1] or [*Ensemble Learning*][2]  (cf. [Anisotropic Kernel][3]) are commonly used for complex tasks. But remember the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)! Always consider the complexity/accuracy trade-off: complex techniques should only be used if they offer significant improvements. Simpler models are also less prone to over-fitting and tend to generalise better.\n\nBut if we're using Machine Learning to actually **get insights from the data**, \"blackbox\" models are almost useless and it's best to stick with simpler, transparent techniques. Let's take the case of a supermarket looking to better understand customer behaviour: the straightforward [*Apriori*][4] algorithm can quickly offer relevant insights like \"80% of customers who bought a suit also bought a tie\" so they may try to increase tie sales by offering a discount to clients buying a suit . Of course, a complex classification algorithm will do better at identifying the customers who bought a tie by taking into account more features, but is that really useful for the supermarket?\n\n*Decision Trees* can also help a lot when we need to understanding the data. A good example is the traditional problem of classifying Iris flowers included in the [sklearn documentation][5], were we can learn about the characteristics of each flower type in the resulting tree. Given their transparency and relatively low computational cost, *Decision Trees* are also very useful for exploring your data before applying other algorithms. They're helpful for checking the quality of engineered features and identifying the most relevant ones by visualising the resulting tree.\n\nThe main downsides of *Decision Trees* are their tendency to over-fit, their inability to grasp relationships between features, and the use of greedy learning algorithms (not guaranteed to find the global optimal model). Using them in a [*Random Forest*][6] helps mitigate some of this issues.\n\nAfter this short introduction to *Decision Trees* and their place in Machine Learning, let's see how to apply them for the Titanic challenge. First, we're going to prepare the dataset and discuss the most relevant features. We'll then find the best tree depth to avoid over-fitting, generate the final model, and explain how to visualise the resulting tree.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm\n  [5]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"af6bb647-50c9-cb5e-5b00-ea49474ff254"},"source":"## Preparing the Titanic dataset ##\n\nFor the Titanic challenge we need to guess wheter the individuals from the *test* dataset had survived or not.

The goal of their learning algorithms is always to find the best split for each node of the tree.

The *sklearn* library we're gonna use implements [Gini Impurity][2], another common measure, so let’s explain it.\n\nGini Impurity measures the disorder of a set of elements. It is calculated as the probability of mislabelling an element assuming that the element is randomly labelled according the the distribution of all the classes in the set. *Decision Trees* will try to find the split which decreases Gini Impurity the most across the two resulting nodes.

This is a critical point for every Data Science project, since too much train data can easily result in bad model generalisation (accuracy on test/real/unseen observations). Over-fitting (a model excessively adapted to the train data) is a common reason. In other cases, too much data can also hide meaningful relationships either because they evolve with time or because highly correlated features prevent the model from capturing properly the value of each single one.\n\nIn the case of decision trees, the 'max_depth' parameter determines the maximum number of attributes the model is going to use for each prediction (up to the number of available features in the dataset).  A good way to find the best value for this parameter is just iterating through all the possible depths and measure the accuracy with a robust method such as [Cross Validation][1].\n\n*Cross Validation* is a model validation technique that splits the training dataset in a given number of \"folds\". Each split uses different data for training and testing purposes, allowing the model to be trained and tested with different data each time. This allows the algorithm to be trained and tested with all available data across all folds, avoiding any splitting bias and giving a good idea of the generalisation of the chosen model. The main downside is that *Cross Validation* requires the model to be trained for each fold, so the computational cost can be very high for complex models or huge datasets.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"33f3999e-e0da-0e2e-dfa1-7be4824c6a36"},"outputs":[],"source":"cv = KFold(n_splits=10)            # Desired number of Cross Validation folds\naccuracies = list()\nmax_attributes = len(list(test))\ndepth_range = range(1, max_attributes + 1)\n\n# Testing max_depths from 1 to max attributes\n# Uncomment prints for details about each Cross Validation pass\nfor depth in depth_range:\n    fold_accuracy = []\n    tree_model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = depth)\n    # print(\"Current max depth: \", depth, \"\\n\")\n    for train_fold, valid_fold in cv.split(train):\n        f_train = train.loc[train_fold] # Extract train data with cv indices\n        f_valid = train.loc[valid_fold] # Extract valid data with cv indices\n\n        model = tree_model.fit(X = f_train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1), \n                               y = f_train[\"Survived\"]) # We fit the model with the fold train data\n        valid_acc = model.score(X = f_valid.drop(['Survived'], axis=1), \n                                y = f_valid[\"Survived\"])# We calculate accuracy with the fold validation data\n        fold_accuracy.append(valid_acc)\n\n    avg = sum(fold_accuracy)/len(fold_accuracy)\n    accuracies.append(avg)\n    # print(\"Accuracy per fold: \", fold_accuracy, \"\\n\")\n    # print(\"Average accuracy: \", avg)\n    # print(\"\\n\")\n    \n# Just to show results conveniently\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"Max Depth\": depth_range, \"Average Accuracy\": accuracies})\ndf = df[[\"Max Depth\", \"Average Accuracy\"]]\nprint(df.to_string(index=False))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e98561cf-fceb-792a-49f6-810ef867d650"},"source":"The best *max_depth* parameter seems therefore to be 3 (82.8% average accuracy across the 10 folds), and feeding the model with more data results in worst results probably due to over-fitting.

It achieves an accuracy of 82.38% across the training dataset. Let's begin explaining how to read the graph.\n\nThe first line of each node (except those of the final row) shows the splitting condition in the form \"*feature* <= *value*\".\n\nNext, we find the Gini Impurity of the node, already explained in this kernel. \"Samples\" is simply the number of observations contained in the node.\n\n\"Value\" shows the class distribution of the samples ([count non_survived, count survived]).\n\nLastly, \"class\" correspond to the predominant class of each node, and this is how our model will classify an observation. The colour also represents the class, the opacity increasing with the actual distribution of samples.\n\nOur model can therefore be summarised with 4 simple rules:\n\n - If our observation includes de \"Mr\" *Title*, then we classify it as not survived (all the branches in the left side of the tree lead to an orange node)\n - If it doesn't include \"Mr\" *Title*, and *FamilySize* is 4 or less, then we classify it as survived.\n - If it doesn't include \"Mr\" *Title*,  *FamilySize* is  more than 4 and *Pclass* is 2 or less, then we classify it as survived.\n - If it doesn't include \"Mr\" *Title*,  *FamilySize* is  more than 4 and *Pclass* is more than 2, then we classify it as not survived.\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1c4c9ece-9a53-31a2-69e3-fff9d3725e3f"},"source":"Thanks to these rules we can infer some insights about the shipwreck. \"Misters\" seem to have honoured their title and sacrificed themselves in favour on women and men with more exotic titles like \"Master\" or \"Dr\".  We can also note that smaller families had better chances to survive, maybe because bigger families tried to stick together or look for missing members and therefore didn't had places left in the lifeboats. Finally, we can observe that 3rd class passengers had also less chances to survive so probably passengers belonging to upper social social classes were privileged, or simply 3rd class cabins may have been further away of the lifeboats.\n\nOur submission to the Titanic competition results in scoring 2234 out of 5672 competition entries. This result only accounts for part of the submission dataset and is indicative while the competition is running.
