Here I've chosen to use the distilBERT architecture because it's smaller, and I'll be able to train more of the paramerters of the model within the confines of the kernel. I've kept a lot of the original tutorial's text to explain what the code is doing.\n\n**A major difference in this notebook and the RoBERTa (and previous versions) notebooks is the implementation of cross validation. Instead of training one model, I train 5 different models, and average the output. Due to time contraints, I will not be able to train each model for very long, but I'm hoping the average across all is better. **\n\n## Google Quest Q&A Overview\n\nThis challenge is about questions and answers. \n\nIn [question answering (QA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering) systems are built that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. These computer systems excel at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. In contrast, humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context.  \n\nFor the [Google QUEST Q&A Labeling competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview), we're tasked with predicting different subjective aspects of question-answering. The data for this competition includes questions and answers, and the task is to predict target values of 30 labels for each question-answer pair.Target labels with the prefix question_ relate to the question_title and/or question_body features in the data, and target labels with the prefix answer_ relate to the answer feature.\n\nThis is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0,1]. Submissions are evaluated with the mean [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Notebook Contents"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Breifly, this notebook uses a transfer learning approach to aid in the question-answer classification task.

This method uses language models trained to predict the next word in a sequence, which is then used in a classification taks.[Viedo here.](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4).\n\nRecently, a new architecture called the **Transformer** (cf. [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) has been shown to be powerful. Google (BERT, Transformer-XL, XLNet), Facebook (RoBERTa, XLM) or even OpenAI (GPT, GPT-2) all have pre-trained their own models with architectures based on the transformer. These pretrained models are availiable through the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) 🤗 [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Formerly known as ``pytorch-transformers`` or ``pytorch-pretrained-bert``, this library has both pre-trained NLP models and additional utilities like tokenizers, optimizers and schedulers. \n\nThis kernel uses the ``transformers`` library within the ``fastai`` framework.
