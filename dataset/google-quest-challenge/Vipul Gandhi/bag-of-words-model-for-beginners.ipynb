Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; the text must be converted into well defined fixed-length(vector) numbers.\n\n## <u> What is a Bag-of-Words? </u>\n\nA bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n- A vocabulary of known words.\n- A measure of the presence of known words.\n\nIt is called a bag-of-words , because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document. The complexity comes both in deciding how to design the vocabulary of known words (or tokens) and how to score the presence of known words.\n\n## <u> Example:</u>\n\nBelow is a snippet of the first few lines of text from the book A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.\n\n$\\text {It was the best of times} $ <br/>\n$\\text {it was the worst of times,}  $  <br/>\n$\\text {it was the age of wisdom,} $ <br/>\n$\\text {it was the age of foolishness} $\n\n## <u>Bag-of-Words Model in SkLearn</u>\n\n### <u> Design the Vocabulary </u>\n\nMake a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.
