The BERT Landscape\n> BERT is a deep learning model that has given state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. It stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers**. It has been pre-trained on Wikipedia and BooksCorpus and requires (only) task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including **Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1)**, **Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**, and others.\n \n It’s not an exaggeration to say that BERT has significantly altered the NLP landscape. Imagine using a single model that is trained on a large unlabelled dataset to achieve State-of-the-Art results on 11 individual NLP tasks. And all of this with little fine-tuning. That’s BERT! It’s a tectonic shift in how we design NLP models.\n\nBERT has inspired many recent NLP architectures, training approaches and language models, such as Google’s TransformerXL, OpenAI’s GPT-2, XLNet, ERNIE2.0, RoBERTa, etc."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. What is BERT?\nIt is basically a bunch of Transformer encoders stacked together (not the whole Transformer architecture but just the encoder). The concept of bidirectionality is the key differentiator between BERT and its predecessor, OpenAI GPT. BERT is bidirectional because its self-attention layer performs self-attention on both directions.\n\nThere are a few things I want to explain in this section.\n\n* First, It’s easy to get that BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Each word here has a meaning to it and we will encounter that one by one. For now, **the key takeaway from this line is – BERT is based on the Transformer architecture.** \n\n* Second, BERT is **pre-trained on a large corpus of unlabelled text** including the entire Wikipedia(that’s 2,500 million words!) and Book Corpus (800 million words). This pretraining step is really important for BERT's success. This is because as we train a model on a large text corpus, our model starts to pick up the deeper and intimate understandings of how the language works. This knowledge is the swiss army knife that is useful for almost any NLP task.\n\n* Third, BERT is a **deeply bidirectional** model. Bidirectional means that BERT learns information from both the left and the right side of a token’s context during the training phase.\n\nThis bidirectional understanding is crucial to take NLP models to the next level. Let's see an example to understand what it really means. There may be two sentences having the same word but their meaning may be completely different based on what comes before or after as we can see here below.\n\n![bidirectionalexample](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sent_context.png)\n\nWithout taking these contexts into consideration it's impossible for machines to truly understand meanings and it may throw out trashy responses time and time again which is not really a good thing.\n\nBut BERT fixes this. Yes it does. That was one of the game changing aspect of BERT.\n\n* Fourth, finally the biggest advantage of BERT is it brought about the **ImageNet movement** with it and the most impressive aspect of BERT is that we can fine-tune it by adding just a couple of additional output layers to create state-of-the-art models for a variety of NLP tasks.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Why BERT matters?\n\nNow I think it's pretty clear to you why but let's see proof, as we should always do.\n\n![stats](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*-k_fjBnCuByNye4v)\n\nWhile it’s not clear that all GLUE tasks are very meaningful, generic models based on an encoder named Transformer (Open-GPT, BERT and BigBird), closed the gap between task-dedicated models and human performance and within less than a year."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. How BERT Works?\nLet’s look a bit closely at BERT and understand why it is such an effective method to model language. We’ve already seen what BERT can do earlier – but how does it do it? We’ll answer this pertinent question in this section.\n\n### 1. Architecture of BERT\n\nBERT is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder. There are two models introduced in the paper.\n\n* BERT base – 12 layers (transformer blocks), 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters.\n* BERT Large – 24 layers, 16 attention heads and, 340 million parameters.\n\nFor an in-depth understanding of the building blocks of BERT (aka Transformers), you should definitely check [this awesome post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) – The Illustrated Transformers.\n\n*Here's a representation of BERT Architecture*\n![arch](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bert_encoder.png)\n\n### 2. Preprocessing Text for BERT\nThe input representation used by BERT is able to represent a single text sentence as well as a pair of sentences (eg., Question, Answering) in a single sequence of tokens.\n\n* The first token of every input sequence is the special classification token – **[CLS]**. This token is used in classification tasks as an aggregate of the entire sequence representation. It is ignored in non-classification tasks.\n* For single text sentence tasks, this **[CLS]** token is followed by the WordPiece tokens and the separator token – **[SEP]**.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig7.png)\n\n* For sentence pair tasks, the WordPiece tokens of the two sentences are separated by another [SEP] token. This input sequence also ends with the **[SEP]** token.\n\n* A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. Sentence embeddings are similar to token/word embeddings with a vocabulary of 2.\n\n* A positional embedding is also added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence.\n\nBERT developers have set a a specific set of rules to represent languages before feeding into the model.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bert_emnedding.png)\n\nFor starters, every input embedding is a combination of 3 embeddings:\n\n* **Position Embeddings**: BERT learns and uses positional embeddings to express the position of words in a sentence. These are added to overcome the limitation of Transformer which, unlike an RNN, is not able to capture “sequence” or “order” information\n* **Segment Embeddings**: BERT can also take sentence pairs as inputs for tasks (Question-Answering). That’s why it learns a unique embedding for the first and the second sentences to help the model distinguish between them. In the above example, all the tokens marked as EA belong to sentence A (and similarly for EB)\n* **Token Embeddings**: These are the embeddings learned for the specific token from the WordPiece token vocabulary\n\nFor a given token, its input representation is constructed by **summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings**.\n\nSuch a comprehensive embedding scheme contains a lot of useful information for the model.\n\nThese combinations of preprocessing steps make BERT so versatile. This implies that without making any major change in the model’s architecture, we can easily train it on multiple kinds of NLP tasks.\n\n**Tokenization:**\nBERT uses WordPiece tokenization. The vocabulary is initialized with all the individual characters in the language, and then the most frequent/likely combinations of the existing words in the vocabulary are iteratively added.\n\n\n### 3. Pre Training\nThe model was trained in two tasks simultaneously:\n\n**1. Masked Language Model** \n\n**2. Next Sentence Prediction.**\n\n**Note:** I am not going to go over these two techniques in this notebook. I recommend online reading."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Fine Tuning Techniques for BERT\nUsing BERT for a specific task is relatively straightforward. BERT can be used for a wide variety of language tasks, while only adding a small layer to the core model\n\n### 5.1 Sequence Classification Tasks\nThe final hidden state of the **[CLS]** token is taken as the fixed-dimensional pooled representation of the input sequence. This is fed to the classification layer. The classification layer is the only new parameter added and has a dimension of K x H, where K is the number of classifier labels and H is the size of the hidden state. The label probabilities are computed with a standard softmax.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig1-1.png?w=460&h=400)\n\n### 5.2 Sentence Pair Classification Tasks\nThis procedure is exactly similar to the single sequence classification task. The only difference is in the input representation where the two sentences are concatenated together.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig2-1.png?w=443&h=398)\n\n### 5.3 Question-Answering Tasks\nQuestion answering is a prediction task. Given a question and a context paragraph, the model predicts a start and an end token from the paragraph that most likely answers the question.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig6.png?w=389&h=297)\n\nJust like sentence pair tasks, the question becomes the first sentence and paragraph the second sentence in the input sequence. There are only two new parameters learned during fine-tuning a start vector and an end vector with size equal to the hidden shape size. The probability of token i being the start of the answer span is computed as – softmax(S . K), where S is the start vector and K is the final transformer output of token i. The same applies to the end token.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig3.png?w=452&h=380)\n\n### 5.4 Single Sentence Tagging Tasks\n\nIn single sentence tagging tasks such as named entity recognition, a tag must be predicted for every word in the input. The final hidden states (the transformer output) of every input token is fed to the classification layer to get a prediction for every token. Since WordPiece tokenizer breaks some words into sub-words, the prediction of only the first token of a word is considered.\n\n![](https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig4.png?w=441&h=389)\n\n### 5.5 Hyperparameter Tuning\nThe optimal hyperparameter values are task-specific. But, the authors found that the following range of values works well across all tasks\n\n* **Dropout** – 0.1\n* **Batch Size** – 16, 32\n* **Learning Rate (Adam)** – 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\n* **Number of epochs** – 3, 4 (yeah you read it right)\n\nThe authors also observed that large datasets (> 100k labeled samples) are less sensitive to hyperparameter choice than smaller datasets.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6. BERT Benchmarks on Question Answering tasks\n\n> The Standford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). Given a question and a paragraph from Wikipedia containing the answer, the task is to predict the answer text span in the paragraph.\n\nIn SQUAD the big improvement in performance was achieved by BERT large. The model that achieved the highest score was an ensemble of BERT large models, augmenting the dataset with TriviaQA.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/558/1*CYzIm-u1-JUR2jDyPRHlQg.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7. Key Takeaways\n\n> 1) Model size matters, even at huge scale. BERT_large, with 345 million parameters, is the largest model of its kind. It is demonstrably superior on small-scale tasks to BERT_base, which uses the same architecture with “only” 110 million parameters.\n\n> 2) With enough training data, more training steps == higher accuracy. For instance, on the MNLI task, the BERT_base accuracy improves by 1.0% when trained on 1M steps (128,000 words batch size) compared to 500K steps with the same batch size.\n\n> 3) BERT’s bidirectional approach (MLM) converges slower than left-to-right approaches (because only 15% of words are predicted in each batch) but bidirectional training still outperforms left-to-right training after a small number of pre-training steps.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1576/0*KONsqvDohE7ytu_E.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 8.
