This is the reason I don't believe classical CNNs trained on raw data will work in this case. I would expect that an algorithm utilising DFSA or Pushdown Automata (PDA), which support counting, are better suited to this challenge.\n\nAgain this is my opinion coming from solving a single challenge with a hardcoded approach.  However some interesting questions arise which can be investigated.  For example, the transitions rules representing \"neighbourhoods\" can probably be learned.  Another direction could be to learn DFSAs using AI techniques?\n\nTo close I believe a combination of Deep Learning techniques and DFSA might be suited to this challenge.
