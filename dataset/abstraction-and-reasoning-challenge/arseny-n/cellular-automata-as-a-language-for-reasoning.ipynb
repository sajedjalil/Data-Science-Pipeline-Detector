Introduction\n\nFirst of all I want to thank the organizers of this  kaggle competition. This competition is quite unorthodox \nand I believe common methods, will fail to work. For me it is hard to think of a tool from the standard machine\nlearning toolbox that will be applicable \"out of the box\" to this challenge and this is quite exciting! \n\nNot every day you are challenged to create an algorithm capable of reasoning!\n\nI believe this challenge could be solved and part of a successful solution are cellular automata, a somewhat niche area of mathematical science.\nIn this notebook I will try to explain how cellular automata (CA) could be used to tackle this challenge.\n\n\nIn  _part 1_ I will briefly describe what are CA, why people are interested in them and how form very few rules extremely complex systems emerge. Then \nin _part 2_ I will describe how CA are connected to this challenge. More precisely how CA could be \nused as a perfect medium for deriving reasoning rules. I will formally define what a CA is and in _part 3_ I will solve several tasks by implementing transition rules for the defined CA. In _part 4 and 5_ I will analyze the task solutions, find interesting patterns and argue how a successful solution to this challenge would look like.\n\nI have also created a [thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/131196) to share CA solutions to complex tasks, you are welocmed to participate !\n\n\n\n# 1. What are Cellular Automata (CA)\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) does a great job in describing what CA is:\n\n> A **cellular automaton** consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states [...], such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule [...] that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.\n\nIn other words CA is a collection of transition rules which specify how to update a set of numbers situated on a grid.\n\nCA are interesting because quite complex behaviours emerge form rather simple rules. \nA great example of such emergence is the, [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) (GoL). \nIn it's classical formulation GoL is implemented using an infinite grid with cells having two states - 0 dead, 1 alive.\n\nThere are four transition rules:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese seemingly simple rules give rise to quite interesting phenomena.\n\n- **[osicllators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator_(cellular_automaton%29)** - patterns which oscillate from one state to the other indefinitely.\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th> Pulsar</th>\n        <th> Kok's galaxy</th>\n        <th> pentadecathlon </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Game_of_life_pulsar.gif\"></img></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Oscilador8periodos.gif\"></img></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/I-Column.gif\"></img> </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n- **[spaseships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_(cellular_automaton%29)** - patterns which move across the grid.\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th> Glider</th>\n        <th> Middle-weight spaceship </th>\n        <th> Heavy-weight spaceship </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Game_of_life_animated_glider.gif\"></img></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Animated_Mwss.gif\"></img></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Animated_Hwss.gif\"></img></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nMore complex behaviors could be created: \n\n - Patterns that are able to produce other patterns. For example guns which produce gliders.\n ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Gospers_glider_gun.gif)\n - Patterns that interact with other patterns in a prefefined way. For example [reflectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflector_(cellular_automaton%29) (the pink ones in the picture below) reflect gliders.\n ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Color_coded_racetrack_large_channel.gif)\n \n - Patters which take a large number of generations to stabilize. For example the [switch engine](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Switch_engine) - a pattern composed of 8 cells stabilizes only after 3911 iterations becomes a pattern of 842 cells.\n <table>\n    <tr>\n        <th> Switch engine it=0</th>\n        <th> Switch engine it=3911</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>       \n        <td><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Ydg4nKS/Cropper-Screenshot-2020-02-17-12-20-34.png\"></img></td>\n        <td><img src=\"https://www.conwaylife.com/w/images/a/af/Switchengine_final.png\"></img></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n \n \nPatterns could be combined together in order to construct more complex patterns. For example the [Noas ark](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Noah%27s_ark) spaceship is created by the combination of two switch engines. The most impressive construction which I have found is a whole [comuter](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life). The system was designed to play tetris, but the tetris game is not hard coded. The the game is written in a higher level language and then compiled and loaded to the computer ROM. The computer architecture is shown in the picture below.\n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JXmnf.png)\n\n\nAgain I want to emphasize - **all shown above emerge from a system based on only 4 rules!**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. How are CA connected to this competition\n\nAs a reminder: in this competition you are given pairs of source-target training images. Your task is to infer the rule which will allow to transition from source image to the target and later apply such rule to an arbitrary number of images. The rules which you should infer are extremely diverse, for example in the first image shown below you should continue the 'stripe' to the right border while in the second you should output the voids formed by the red shapes.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.ibb.co/h8bkyPV/task-1.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/s5F3Fwz/task-0.png\" alt=\"task-0\" border=\"0\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nI feel, a somewhat fundamental question should be answered - how such rules should be represented.\n\nIn the general case this is an [excitingly difficult problem](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/ftp/psz/k-rep.html), but in case of this competition I think that one could try to exploit the cellular automata ability of creating complex behaviors form simple rules. And use them as a language which could be created by an algorithm in order to represent the challenge tasks rules. \n\nBefore going further I will first define precisely what I mean by cellular automata and what I mean when I say 'language to represent rules'. Then I will illustrate \nhow to apply CA to this challenge by solving three tasks.\n\n## Formulation of CA \n\nWe will use a life like cellular automata. \nOur CA will have two grids - and input and an output grid. The CA transition rules are applied to the input grid, the transition rules outputs are written to the output grid. Once the iteration is completed the output grid becomes the input grid. \n\nAs input our transition rules take:\n- the value of the `i,j` input cell\n- a neighborhood around the `i, j`-th input the cell in the input grid\n- flags denoting weather the current cell is near a border\n\nAs output the transition rules give:\n- the value of the `i, j` cell in the output grid\n\n\nThe iterations of the CA are preformed while a stable state is not reached i.e. the input grid is equal tho the output grid. The stable state is expected to be the solution to the challenge.\n\n\nCA transition rules are a great way to represent the rules you are expected to infer in this challenge. As you can notice they have a rather constrained input, and later I will show that they also make use of a rather constrained set of operations. This makes them a perfect candidate for being the \"language for reason\".\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.

The stable state is the solution and only 5 rules, again !"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4. Analysis of transition rules\n\nLet' take a closer look at the transition rules - although there is quite a lot of python, they actually perform a rather limited set of actions.\n\nNamely, they only:\n- compare the value of the current cell to a predefined value        \n- compare the value of a neighborhood cell to a predefined value        \n- check if the current cell is near the border \n- count the number of occurrences of a specific value in the neighborhood cells (Checking  the presence or absence of a specific value in the neighborhood cells could be thought as a subset of this action.)\n    \nAlso they use simple logical `and`, `or` to combine the tests on the input grid. \n\nNote that the rules for all three tasks are written in one big `if`-statement (the last task uses two ifs to handle the hidden grid).\nSo we can see that all the test preformed on one grid are mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n# 5. A probable solution approach\n\nThe goal of previous analysis was to show how little is needed to write a solution by using CA transition rules. \nThis is important, because if the task of this challenge is to develop an algorithm which will be able derive \nrules form few examples, then the language in which the rules are derived should permit to express complex \nbehaviors with as little as possible. \n\nSo, a probable solution approach is to create an algorithm which will generate transition rules \nfor CAs which in their turn will solve the given tasks.\n\n\n## Solving challenging tasks\n\n\nObviously some extension to the current CA formulation are required, for example the current formulation \ndoes not handle \"zoom in\" and \"zoom out\" tasks where the size of the input and output grids does not match.\n\nSome tasks require general reasoning, like comparing sizes of object and their relative position, some \nrequire finding non trivial patterns. I think it would be interesting to try to implement as many hard \ntasks as possible with the current formulation of CA in order to find failures in the current formulation.\nTo do this I created a discussion [thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/131196), fell free to participate.\n\nCurrently I have completed a solution for task `training/08ed6ac7`, the one shown in the begining. In `training/08ed6ac7` \nyou are expected to color the bars according to their size. I plan to write a kernel explaining the solution the until \nthe end of this week.\n\n\n## Other approaches \n\nA good question to ask: is the current CA definition the optimal choice ?\n    \nThere are different ways to define CA for example - in [second order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cellular_automaton) cellular automata the state of a cell is determined by the cell neighborhood at the two previous time steps, in [block automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cellular_automaton) a regular lattice is shifted across the grid and the transition rules are applied to the cells in each lattice cell. It is possible to use neural netowrks to create transition rules, like in [neural GPU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08228.pdf) or this Alexander Mordvintsev [disitll article](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/). \n\nWell maybe CA is not part of the best solution at all ! \nIt will be great to explore possible approaches to solving this problem.\n\nIf you want to further discuss CA you are welcome to do so in the comment section to this post or this [topic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/131195)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References    \n    \nMore about CA:\n- https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/ : A new kind of science, a well know book by Steven Wolfram about CA\n- https://web.archive.org/web/20170706093620/https://www.irif.fr/~yunes/ca/archives/bookvivien.pdf : A more formal book about CA\n\nCA & neural networks:\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08228.pdf : neural GPU\n- https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/ : disitll article about neural network parametrized CA rules\n\nMore about GoL:\n- https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/ConwayLife.com : a great wiki\n- https://copy.sh/life/ : an online Gol interpreter\n- https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life : a computer implemented in Gol\n\nKnowledge Representation:\n- https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/ftp/psz/k-rep.html : an article by Randall Davis et al. which explores what knowledge representation is\n    \n   "}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
