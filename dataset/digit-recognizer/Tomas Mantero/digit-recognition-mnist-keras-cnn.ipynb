Introduction\n\nThis is a 5 layers Sequential [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) for digits recognition trained on [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). I chose to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.\n\n**For computational reasons, i set the number of steps (epochs) to 5, if you want to achieve 99+% of accuracy set it to 30.**\n\nThis Notebook follows three main parts:\n\n* The data preparation\n* The CNN modeling and evaluation\n* The results prediction and submission\n\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"/>\n<br>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Imports"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# data analysis and wrangling\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(2)\n\n# visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set(style='white', context='notebook', palette='deep')\n\n# train test split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport itertools\n\n# creating a model\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical # convert to one-hot-encoding\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Definitions***\n\n**[itertools](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-itertools-in-python):** It is used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop.

For example, “red” is 1, “green” is 2, and “blue” is 3.\n\n**One-Hot Encoding:** The integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each unique integer value.

CNN\n## 3.1 Define the model"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I used the [Keras Sequential API](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/), where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional [(Conv2D)](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling [(MaxPool2D)](https://keras.io/api/layers/pooling_layers/max_pooling2d/) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\n[Dropout](https://keras.io/api/layers/regularization_layers/dropout/) is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n['relu'](https://keras.io/api/layers/activations/) is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe [Flatten layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/flatten/) is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end I used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier.

We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the **\"categorical_crossentropy\".**\n\nThe most important function is **[the optimizer.](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/)** This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed **[RMSprop](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/rmsprop/)** (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer.
