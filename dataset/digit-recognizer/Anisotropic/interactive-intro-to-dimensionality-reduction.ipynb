Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\nIn a nutshell, PCA is a linear transformation algorithm that seeks to project the original features of our data onto a smaller set of features ( or subspace ) while still retaining most of the information. To do this the algorithm tries to find the most appropriate directions/angles ( which are the principal components ) that maximise the variance in the new subspace. Why maximise the variance though? \n\nTo answer the question, more context has to be given about the PCA method. One has to understand that the principal components are orthogonal to each other ( think right angle ). As such when generating the covariance matrix ( measure of how related 2 variables are to each other ) in our new subspace, the off-diagonal values of the covariance matrix will be zero and only the diagonals ( or eigenvalues) will be non-zero. It is these diagonal values that represent the *variances* of the principal components that we are talking about or information about the variability of our features. \n\nTherefore when PCA seeks to maximise this variance, the method is trying to find directions ( principal components ) that contain the largest spread/subset of data points or information ( variance ) relative to all the data points present. For a brilliant and detailed description on this, check out this stackexchange thread: \n\n[PCA and proportion of variance explained][1] by amoeba\n\n  [1]: http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/140579/3277"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"777890904ab0b2c4fe772191f25781c9719ceb48","_cell_guid":"ec9f7dff-e524-340b-fbba-09a47af726d4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Calculating the Eigenvectors\n\nNow it may be informative to observe how the variances look like for the digits in the MNIST dataset.

So if one wanted to implement a PCA on this, extracting the top 200 features would be a very logical choice as they already account for the majority of the data.\nIn the section below, I will use the immensely powerful Sklearn toolkit and its built-in PCA method. Unfortunately for brevity I will not be covering how to implement PCA from scratch, partly due to the multitude of resources already available.

As such implementing the method from scratch can roughly be split into 4 distinct stages as below.

The good thing about IPython notebook is that you can render your equations (LaTeX) automatically by putting them within the **$$** symbol, courtesy of the use of MathJax - a JavaScript equation display engine.\n\n**A. Projected Means**\n\nSince this method was designed to take into account class labels we therefore first need to establish a suitable metric with which to measure the 'distance' or separation between different classes. Let's assume that we have a set of data points *x* that belong to one particular class *w*. Therefore in LDA the first step is to the project these points onto a new line, Y that contains the class-specific information via the transformation  \n\n$$Y = \\omega^\\intercal x $$\n\nWith this the idea is to find some method that maximises the separation of these new projected variables. To do so, we first calculate the projected mean.\n\n**B.  Scatter Matrices and their solutions**\nHaving introduced our projected means, we now need to find a function that can represent the difference between the means and then maximise it. Like in linear regression, where the most basic case is to find the line of best fit we need to find the equivalent of the variance in this context. And hence this is where we introduce scatter matrices where the scatter is the equivalent of the variance.\n\n$$ \\tilde{S}^{2} = (y - \\tilde{mu})^{2}$$\n\n\n**C.

We've also discussed the relative merits of using supervised and unsupervised methods as well as the KMeans clustering technique when it comes to an unsupervised scenario.  \n\nApart from these three common reduction methods, there exists a whole host of other dimensionality reduction methods not discussed in this notebook. Just to name a few, they include methods like Sammon's Mapping, Multi-dimensional Scaling or even some graph based visualisation methods.  \n\nI hope this notebook has been useful especially with regards to introducing the concepts of dimensionality reduction if it is new to you. And the key takeaway would be that each method has its own pros and cons and are not to be used as a one-size-fits-all/I-will-only-use-my-favourite method but rather to be implemented as the situation calls for it. \n\nPeace out "}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
