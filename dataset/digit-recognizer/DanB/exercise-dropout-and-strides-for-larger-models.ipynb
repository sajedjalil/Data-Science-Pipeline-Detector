In practice, you'll need to decide whether that type of speed is important in the applications where you eventually apply deep learning models.\n\nYou could experiment with more layers or more convolutions in each layer.

You have the tools to create and tune computer vision models.  \n\nIf you feel like playing more with this dataset, you can open up a new code cell to experiment with different models (adding dropout, adding layers, etc.)  Or pick a new project and try out your skills.  \n\nA few fun datasets you might try include:\n- [Written letter recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/classification-of-handwritten-letters)\n- [Flower Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)\n- [Cats vs Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)\n- [10 Monkeys](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species)\n- [Predict Bone Age from X-Rays](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/rsna-bone-age)\n\nYou have learned a lot, and you'll learn it as you practice.
