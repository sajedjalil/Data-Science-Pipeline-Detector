Starting with a brief benchmark Python code [found in the forums](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/forums/t/2299/getting-started-python-sample-code-random-forest) one can jump into solving the Digit Recognizer\nproblem right away. Below code that uses Random Forest algorithm to classify images as digits will give you \naround 0.96 accuracy score in less than a minute which is great. However, this score will put you lower than the 200th place. \nAccording to [MNIST web page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), convolutional neural networks algorithm yields good results.\nI will try a simple neural network algorithm out in Python, expand it into a convolutional neural network and see if I can break into the top 100."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# create the training & test sets, skipping the header row with [1:]\ndataset = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")\ntarget = dataset[[0]].values.ravel()\ntrain = dataset.iloc[:,1:].values\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"../input/test.csv\").values\n\n# create and train the random forest\n# multi-core CPUs can use: rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=2)\nrf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\nrf.fit(train, target)\npred = rf.predict(test)\n\nnp.savetxt('submission_rand_forest.csv', np.c_[range(1,len(test)+1),pred], delimiter=',', header = 'ImageId,Label', comments = '', fmt='%d')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Table of contents\n1.

Its quick, intuitive, well documented and has a big community.\nHowever, its biggest drawback in my opinion is setting up the environment. My set up is [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) coupled \nwith [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Both are great tools, howeverm I ended up spending \ncouple hours taking care of the dependencies theano and lasagne and the Windows environment variables. In contrast to Mathematica which \nhas superb report generating options, setting up Python environment can be and was for me a tiring experience. Nevertheless, it pays off because \nPython framework is well developed for solving data problems. For instance, Mathematica does not even have a CNN\nimplementation available as of 11/4/2015 and everything is done under the hood whereas in a Python framework one \ncan find almost any algorithm imaginable.\n\nAmong Python, R and Julia I beleive Python and R are most competitive data science technologies with Julia being \nin the process of maturing. Choosing Python over R and vica versa really has to do with either individual preference or\nthe suitability of the technology for the problem at hand. Python is more efficient than R. But Julia is more \nefficient than both Python and R.\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Resources Used:\n[Convolutional Neural Networks (LeNet)](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html)\n\n[CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)\n\n[Tutorial: Training convolutional neural networks with nolearn](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dnouri/nolearn/blob/master/docs/notebooks/CNN_tutorial.ipynb)\n\n[Using convolutional neural nets to detect facial keypoints tutorial](http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/)\n\n[Deep learning – Convolutional neural networks and feature extraction with Python](http://blog.christianperone.com/2015/08/convolutional-neural-networks-and-feature-extraction-with-python/)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
