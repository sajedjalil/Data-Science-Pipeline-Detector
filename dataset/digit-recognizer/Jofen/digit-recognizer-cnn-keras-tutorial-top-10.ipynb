I am trying to understand CNN Deep Learning models. \n\nThe layers of convolutional neural network consists of two main components :\n1. Convolutional layers : the convolutional layer is responsible for the convolutional operation in which feature maps identifies features in the images.\nand is usually followed by two types of layers which are :\n>*   **Dropout** : Dropout is a regulization technique where you turn off part of the network's layers randomally to increase regulization and hense decrease overfitting. We use when the training set accuracy is muuch higher than the test set accuracy.\n>*   **Max Pooling** : The maximum output in a rectangular neighbourhood. It is used to make the network more flexible to slight changes and decrease the network computationl expenses by extracting the group of pixels that are highly contributing to each feature in the feature maps in the layer.\n2. Dense layers : The dense layer is a fully connected layer that comes after the convolutional layers and they give us the output vector of the Network.\n\nAs a convention in Convolutional Neural Network we decrease the dimensions of the layers as we go deeper and increase the number of feature maps to make it detect more features and decrease the number of computational cost.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoghazyCoder/Machine-Learning-Tutorials/master/assets/Untitled.png)\n \nHope it might be useful for someone else here as well.

The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations occuring when someone is writing a digit.\n\nThe model augments data randomly each time the training requires a new batch of images, so the model isn't training on the same examples exactly at each epoch which is the case if we have simply fitted the model using the original images.\n\nThe augmentation generator will only use the train portion we got from the split.

BatchNormalization - enhances training efficiency and reduces Vanishing/Exploding Gradients effect\n3. ReLU Activation Function\n4. 2D Max Pool - optional, reduces overfitting and reduces the shape of the tensor\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.\n\n**Cost function**\n\nIt is a measure of the overall loss in our network after assigning values to the parameters during the forward phase so it indicates how well the parameters were chosen during the forward probagation phase. We are using categorical_crossentropy as the cost function.\n\n**Optimizer**\n\nIt is the gradiant descent algorithm that is used. We use it to minimize the cost function to approach the minimum point. We are using adam optimizer which is one of the best gradient descent algorithms. You can refere to this paper to know how it works https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8\n\nYou can use other metrics to measure the performance other than accuracy as precision or recall or F1 score. the choice depends on the problem itself. Where high recall means low number of false negatives , High precision means low number of false positives and F1 score is a trade off between them. You can refere to this article for more about precision and recall http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html\n \n### Best Practice\n* Getting convergence should not be a problem, unless you use an extremely large learning rate. It's easy, however, to create a net that overfits, with perfect results on the training set and very poor results on the validation data. If this happens, you could try increasing the Dropout parameters, increase augmentation, or perhaps stop training earlier. If you instead wants to increase accuracy, try adding on two more layers, or increase the number of filters.\n* In order to make the optimizer converge faster and closest to the global minimum of the loss function, its better to have a decreasing learning rate during the training to reach efficiently the global minimum of the loss function.\n*  Advanced techniques include data augmentation, nonlinear convolution layers, learnable pooling layers, ReLU activation, ensembling, bagging, decaying learning rates, dropout, batch normalization, and adam optimization."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 43\nnp.random.seed(seed)\n\nlearning_rate=0.00065\n# Define the optimizer\n#optimizer = RMSprop(lr=learning_rate, decay=learning_rate/2)\noptimizer = Adam(lr=learning_rate)\n\ndef conv_block(x, filters, kernel_size, strides, layer_no, use_pool=False, padding='same'):\n    x = Convolution2D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, strides=strides, name=f'conv{layer_no}',\n               padding=padding)(x)\n    \n    x = BatchNormalization(name=f'bn{layer_no}')(x)\n    x = Activation('relu', name=f'activation{layer_no}')(x)\n    if use_pool:\n        x = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=[2, 2], strides=[2, 2], name=f'pool{layer_no}', padding='same')(x)\n    return x\n\ndef build_model(X):\n    h, w, c = X.shape[1:]  #

This is often done with trial and error, and there is no easy shortcut.\n* Confusion matrix can be very helpfull to see your model drawbacks.\n\n### Model Evaluation\nThere are so many choices for CNN architecture. How do we choose the best one? First we must define what **best** means. The best may be the simplest, or it may be the most efficient at producing accuracy while minimizing computational complexity. In this kernel, we will run experiments to find the most accurate and efficient CNN architecture for classifying MNIST handwritten digits.\n\n#### 1. How many convolution-subsambling pairs?\nFirst question, how many pairs of convolution-subsampling should we use? For example, our network could have 1, 2, or 3:\n * 784 - **[24C5-P2]** - 256 - 10\n * 784 - **[24C5-P2] - [48C5-P2]** - 256 - 10\n * 784 - **[24C5-P2] - [48C5-P2] - [64C5-P2]** - 256 - 10  \n   \nIt's typical to increase the number of feature maps for each subsequent pair as shown here. Let's see whether one, two, or three pairs is best. We are not doing four pairs since the image will be reduced too small before then. The input image is 28x28. After one pair, it's 14x14. After two, it's 7x7. After three it's 4x4 (or 3x3 if we don't use padding='same'). It doesn't make sense to do a fourth convolution.\n#### 2. How many feature maps?\nIn the previous experiement, we decided that two pairs is sufficient. How many feature maps should we include? For example, we could do\n * 784 - [**8**C5-P2] - [**16**C5-P2] - 256 - 10\n * 784 - [**16**C5-P2] - [**32**C5-P2] - 256 - 10\n * 784 - [**24**C5-P2] - [**48**C5-P2] - 256 - 10\n * 784 - [**32**C5-P2] - [**64**C5-P2] - 256 - 10\n * 784 - [**48**C5-P2] - [**96**C5-P2] - 256 - 10  \n * 784 - [**64**C5-P2] - [**128**C5-P2] - 256 - 10  \n\n#### 3. How large a dense layer?\nHow many dense units should we use? For example we could use\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **0** - 10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **32** - 10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **64** - 10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **128** -10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **256** - 10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **512** -10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **1024** - 10\n * 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - **2048** - 10\n\n#### 4. How much dropout?\nDropout will prevent our network from overfitting thus helping our network generalize better. How much dropout should we add after each layer?\n * 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%\n\n#### 5. Advanced features\nInstead of using one convolution layer of size 5x5, you can mimic 5x5 by using two consecutive 3x3 layers and it will be more nonlinear. Instead of using a max pooling layer, you can subsample by using a convolution layer with strides=2 and it will be learnable. Lastly, does batch normalization help? And does data augmentation help?
