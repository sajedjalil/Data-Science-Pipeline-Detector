{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nThis is one of I'm sure many notebooks here examining the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. Transfer learning is not used, rather a CNN with 3 convolutional layers, 4 hidden layers, and an output layer. This model was able to achieve 99.457%, although that does require a bit of a lucky run. \n\nMy hope is that this notebook will help someone who is learning PyTorch, as I recently was. On that note, this notebook includes some PyTorch things like: a custom dataset class that inherits PyTorch's dataset class, transforms, putting data and the network on a GPU/CPU, various neurel network layers, a training loop, and an evaluation loop. Some images are also visualized using matplotlib and a simple confusion matrix is made. If you're new to PyTorch, hopefully you will find something useful in this notebook!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Time\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torchvision\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Gets the GPU if there is one, otherwise the cpu\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(device)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Quick function that gets how many out of 'preds' match 'labels'\n# To be used much later\ndef get_num_correct(preds, labels):\n    return preds.argmax(dim=1).eq(labels).sum().item()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in the train set and the test set\n# In a kernel here on Kaggle, use the Workspace on the right-hand side to figure out the file path\ntrain_set = pd.read_csv(\"../input/digit-recognizer/train.csv\")\ntest_images = pd.read_csv(\"../input/digit-recognizer/test.csv\")\n\n# Split the train set so there is also a validation set\ntrain_images, val_images, train_labels, val_labels = train_test_split(train_set.iloc[:, 1:], \n                                                                     train_set.iloc[:, 0], \n                                                                     test_size=0.2)\n\n# Reset indices so the Dataset can find them with __getitem__ easily\ntrain_images.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\nval_images.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\ntrain_labels.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\nval_labels.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Some Data Visualization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's just display a number as a dataframe for fun \n# (I think it looks cool, plus it led to something else I tried, mentioned in the last section)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 28)\npd.DataFrame(train_images.iloc[3, :].to_numpy().reshape(28, 28))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some quick data visualization\n# (not a terribly exciting dataset)\n# First 25 images in training set\n# Note: label is above the image\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=5, ncols=5, figsize=(8,8))\nfig.subplots_adjust(hspace=.3)\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        ax[i][j].axis('off')\n        ax[i][j].imshow(train_images.iloc[[i+(j*5)], :].to_numpy().astype(np.uint8).reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')\n        ax[i][j].set_title(train_labels[i+(j*5)])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some more quick data visualization\n# First 10 images of each class in the training set\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=10, ncols=10, figsize=(10,10))\n\n# I know these for loops look weird, but this way num_i is only computed once for each class\n# Trust me the way I had this before was more normal, but this is more efficient\nfor i in range(10): #
