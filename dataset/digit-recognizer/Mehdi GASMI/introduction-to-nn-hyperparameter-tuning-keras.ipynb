provides an overview on building a simple sequential Neural Network using Tensorflow Keras API and then finding the best hyperparameters to increase its accuracy using different approaches by evaluating their reliability and the time it takes them to get there.\n\nThe first part of the notebook is an exploratory analysis that we will use for this experiment.\n\nThereafter, we will do Data engineering to favor the diversity of our Dataset.\n\nFinally the most important part is the optimization of the parameters of the network in order to increase its performance.\n\nI do this experiment after having completed the theoretical courses provided by <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning\">deeplearnong.ai</a> i recommend to everyone and also the excellent conference of  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtAVBeLuigI&t=6823s\">Martin Görner</a> if you speak French =)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img

can apply this methodology very well for other problems. wait, i will even say, it is recomendable to apply this methodology for other problems with input data which are neither images or videos because a convolutional neural network (CNN) which I do not use here performs far better than a standard neural network.\n\nA trivial sequential neural network can have good results if we choose the right configuration and combine it with other neural networks or other algorithms.\n\nEnough talking leave room for the most important ! \n\n<BR CLEAR=”left”

honestly I don't know and few people can explain this, it's just that there is a guy who was inspired by biomimetism who tried and it worked well. Softmax because this function exaggerates the differences between the 1 and the 0 of the output layer, as we have 10 output neurons and each one corresponds to a digit (0 to 9) the neuron with the highest score wins and represents the prediction, and softmax is perfect for that because it increases the value above 0.5 and decreases the value below 0.5.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/ryjCvhmb/dropout.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\">\n\n* The dropout eliminates a percentage of neurons at random from each layer at each iteration which reduces the degree of freedom of the network and it works quite well against overfitting.\n\n<BR CLEAR=”left” />\n\n* The error function is categorical crossentropy, it is a function that calculates the difference between the predicted output and the real output, it gives us how wrong our model is, the objective of learning is to minimize this function as much as possible using the optimization algorithm.

I have chosen the values 256 and 512, it is preferable to choose a multiple of 2.\n\n* The epoch is the number of times that the network goes around all the training data.

The difference between Adam and RMSpro and that Adam uses the principle of RMSprop and he adds another accelerator called the momentum.\n<BR CLEAR=”left” />\n\n* Finally the number of neurons of each layer which define the degree of freedom of the network, if the number is too high that can cause an overfitting and if it is small it generates an underfitting.

At each step a Gaussian Process is fitted to the known samples (points previously explored), and the posterior distribution, combined with a exploration strategy (such as UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), or EI (Expected Improvement)), are used to determine the next point that should be explored (see the gif below).\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/bJYvMWFR/bayesian-optimization.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\">\n\nThis process is designed to minimize the number of steps required to find a combination of parameters that are close to the optimal combination. To do so, this method uses a proxy optimization problem (finding the maximum of the acquisition function) that, albeit still a hard problem, is cheaper (in the computational sense) and common tools can be employed. Therefore Bayesian Optimization is most adequate for situations where sampling the function to be optimized is a very expensive endeavor.
