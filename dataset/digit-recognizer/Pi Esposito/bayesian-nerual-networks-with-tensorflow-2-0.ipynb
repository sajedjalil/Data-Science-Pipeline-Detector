Introduction\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1 The \"need\" for uncertainity gathering on predictions\n\nNeural Networks do work by performing feedforward and outputing logits, which can be used as predictions or interpreted as wished. \n\nDespite being very accurate and able to model (with the right hyperparameters) any kind of mathematical function, NNs do operate with any kind of data (if encoded in a tensor according to its input shape). For illustration purposes, it means that, on the case of a image-classifier CNN, once I've encoded an image as a tensor as the same of its input, I'm able to try to predict its label even if my image has nothing to see with my classificator purpose. It also means that, even when I'm trying to predict a very noisy image (which can almos be seen as noise), the network will output a deterministic prediction for it (** see point 3. for illustration**). \n\nWe understand that it would be nice to know how certain our network is of its prediction. For example, in an autonomous car, it should be mandatory to have threshold on which, even if it does not recognize a pedestrian, depending on the uncertanity of its prediction, the car acts as if there was one. This goes for many examples on sensible decisions on which life is involved. \n\nWe also understand that, in some financial cases, (e.g., neural-network consulting stock trader bot) it would also be nice to understand if there is a situation where it is not sure on how to behave and thus stop trading in order to avoid money loss.\n\n**In short, the point is that it would be very beneficial for Deep Learning guided decision process if the neural network could know if it is not trained to understand the data fed on it and output something which can be interpreted as \"I'm interpreting this as noise\".**[](http://)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.2 The Bayesian approach for Neural Networks\n\nIn order to address that issue, it was created a Bayesian Approach to Neural Networks. It consists on building networks if layer which we will call **proabilistic layers**. This lets gather uncertainity on our predictions, as we will see."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Probabilistic layers\n\nProbabilistic layers are neural network layers on which the weights are not deterministic. They are actually **random variables (normally distributed) sampled differently on each feedforward step of the network**. When the layer is being built, for each weight, it randomly starts **mean and standard deviation, which are the trainable parameters**. \n\n**When the layer is called (i.e., on each feedforward step), it samples a weight from the distribution and runs normally.**\n\n**On the backpropagation step, for each trainable random variable, the gradients are the partial derivative from the Loss in relative the mean and standard deviation**.\n\nThis layer-sampling step means that, if we predict many times on the same input, we will have different weights sampled (according to the distribution). Thus, noisy images as prone to have more \"uniform-like\" distribution, being more sensible to the feature extraction layer changes (as they have no features at all), while real clean images will be less sensible to layer changing and ar prone to keep the same prediction (its label).\n\nTo illustrate the feedforward step, we see a  bayesian network on the right side. We see that the bayesian one has a different probability distribution for each weight.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope/master/img/bbb_nn_bayes.png)\n[Credits for Gluon](https://gluon.mxnet.io/chapter18_variational-methods-and-uncertainty/bayes-by-backprop.html)\n\n#### Uncertanity gathering\n\nTo gather uncertanity on our predictions, we use Monte Carlo methods and predict it N times, saving each sampled prediction. We then get the prediction distribution and, using a threshold, decide that, if the mode of the prediction represent less then the threshold, then the network should not decide at all and we do not consider the prediction. Our \"reliability\" of the predicition the % of the total predictions that the mode represent. \n\nReal data tend to have the mode representing almost 100%, while the more noisy it is, the more it uniform distribution it will have.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.3 ELBO loss function \n\n\nAs we are working with Probability distribution, we will use a combination of the KL divergence, which is a mathematical representation of the information loss on representing the labels of the train features-label pair with the feedforward representation with the sparse categorical crossentropy, as is usually done on classification NN modelling.\n\nAs TensorFlow lets us calculate each of this losses, won´t have to code it by hand. If you want to know more about the derivatives and the math, I'm putting a link for the original paper on the end of this kernel.\n\nBy the way, we call this function the ELBO loss functon, which stants for expected lower bound.\nIt is defined as:\n\n(The KL Divergence of our predicted distribution relative to the labels plus the crossentropy of our predicted relative to the labels - being Q the predicted probabilities or logits):[](http://)\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n* \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{D}, \\mathbf{\\theta}) = \\text{KL}[q(\\mathbf{w}\\ |\\ \\mathbf{\\theta})\\ ||\\ P(\\mathbf{w})] - \\mathbb{E}_{q(\\mathbf{w}\\ |\\ \\mathbf{\\theta})}[\\log P(\\mathcal{D}\\ |\\ \\mathbf{w})]\n\\end{equation*}"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.4 Notes on TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow probability\n\nFirst, some useful links:\n\n* [TensorFlow 2.0 quickstart tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/)\n\n* [TensorFlow Probability main page and tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)\n\n#### TensorFlow 2.0\n##### All the features explained here will be shown during the implementations\n* TensorFlow 2.0 has ended tf.Session(), feed_dict and sess.run. We now just have to call the node of the graph to get its value. TensorFlow 2.0 has also ended the need for placeholders, giving us a much more intuitive way to flow tensors thorugh graphs:\n\n* We define it as a funcion with the inputs a parameters. We do the operations and return the nodes we want to. The only thing we have to do is put @tf.function decorator above the definition. We can calculate losses and optimize models with tf.functions in a much easier way.\n\n* For gradient appliying, we have gradientTape which gets the derivative of our last operation relative to all the nodes conected to it, and a powerful and easy way to apply those gradients with the optimizer.\n\n\n\n#### TensorFlow Probability\n\n* The probabilistic counterpart os TensorFlow has, on its features, some probabilistic counterparts for layers, so we don't have to bother in implementing probabilistic layers.\n\n* The nightly version of TFP works well with all the TensorFlow 2.0 features, and so it will be very easy to write custom losses and manually optimizing our Bayesian Network on the future."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Bayesian Networks are more prone to avoid overfitting, due to the weights uncertainity;\n4.  On the other side, Bayesian Networks do last more to train and to start having some good accuracy on which we can rely on."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.
