It has been sweeping the board in competitions for the last several years, but perhaps its first big success came in the late 90's when [Yann LeCun][1] used it to solve MNIST with 99.5% accuracy. I will show you how it is done in Keras, which is a user-friendly neural network library for python.\n\nMany other notebooks here use a simple fully-connected network (no convolution) to achieve 96-97%, which is a poor result on this dataset. In contrast, what I will show you here is nearly state-of-the-art. In the Kernel (<20 minutes training) we will achieve 99%, but if you train it overnight (or with a GPU) you should reach 99.5. If you then ensemble over several runs, you should get close to the best published accuracy of 99.77% . (Ignore the 100% results on the leaderboard; they were created by learning the test set through repeat submissions)\n\nHere goes:\n\n\n  [1]: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19d8eb6b-9b71-029c-06e1-7e74975ae669"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8e18fecf-bc7e-dd8d-0894-2601c3f69e97"},"source":"If you don't already have [Keras][1], you can easily install it through conda or pip.

We will the Sequential API, where you just add on one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe most important part are the convolutional layers Conv2D. Here they have 16-32 filters that use nine weights each to transform a pixel to a weighted average of itself and its eight neighbors. As the same nine weights are used over the whole image, the net will pick up features that are useful everywhere. As it is only nine weights, we can stack many convolutional layers on top of each other without running out of memory/time. \n\nThe MaxPooling layers just look at four neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. This reduces the size of the image by half, and by combining convolutional and pooling layers, the net be able to combine its features to learn more global features of the image. In the end we use the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers.\n\nBatch Normalization is a technical trick to make training faster. Dropout is a regularization method, where the layer randomly replaces  a proportion of its weights to zero for each training sample. This forces the net to learn features in a distributed way, not relying to much on a particular weight, and therefore improves generalization.
