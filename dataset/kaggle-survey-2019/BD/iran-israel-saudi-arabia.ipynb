More than half of them are working in companies with more than 1000 employees.\n\nBy the way, working with this quantity needs to be more careful about deriving insights. For example, by knowing the percentage of people working in big companies, it is not easy to have an estimation of the number of big companies. Because for each big company, you might have several data scientists participating in the same survey. It is not surprising as there is a heavy positive correlation between the participation of two colleagues. *(It somehow reminds me of **[Impossible Bet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M)**; the expectation of the size of the cycle of a random person is more than the expectation of a random cycle since bigger cycles contain more persons!)*\n\nAnother thing that might worth noticing is that there might be some kind of standards/thresholds for a company to hire a data scientist. It might be the case that only big companies are hiring data scientists in Saudi Arabia.

I mainly did this because Saudi Arabia had almost half the participants as others, so I just normalized them to compare the decomposition. Also note that since the participants were allowed to choose multiple options, these percentages don't sum up to 100. For technical questions, I omitted percentages, to avoid the crowd. You may easily return it back by calling the function 'multi_plotter'. You may also use the last arg of this function to rotate the labels if there is some overlap between the plots.\n\nIn the end, I would like to mention that there is a clever way to preprocess this data as they were distributed in different columns. You may find the labels by grabbing the unique value in each column, and then just using not-null function on the whole table and then summing up each column grouped by each country. If you don't mind about styling, called build-in pandas plotting, gives you a fairly good visualization of the data... But to be more delightful, I used another trick to be able to use Seaborn's barplot.\n<br/><br/>\n### Source of Learning\n\nI have sorted the columns based on the sum of the participants in these countries.
