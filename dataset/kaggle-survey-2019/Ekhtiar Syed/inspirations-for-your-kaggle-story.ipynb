This is a different kind of competition, where you can do analysis on the data (rather than machine learning) and tell a story. \n\n### Instead of keeping my notebook private, I thought about spending my time to create a notebook with inspiration for many stories.

You can look into which countries are well connected to Kaggle, and which countries are not so well connected to Kaggle. I did the plot without normalizing the response by the total number population or members. Perhaps, more interesting insights would pop out if one did do that. For example, we know India and China almost has the same number of population. However, Kaggle community in India is far greater than Kaggle community in China.\n\n* **Male to Female Ratio:** The gender ratio in Kaggle community (according to this survey) looks a little sad. If you look at the top five countries with very low male to female respondant ratio, it is Norway, Bangladesh, Denmark, Belgium, and Japan. The odd thing is, Bangladesh is the only developing country on that list! Furthermore, if you look at the top 5 countries in terms of balanced male to female Kaggler ratio, you would find: Tunasia, Phillippines, Iran, Malaysia, and Kenya. All of them are developing countries, where women face many challenges to obtain basic education.

In your story, you could further concencrate on for the older age group that did responde (50+) and see what more could be done to make other people from that age group engage more with Kaggle.\n* **Male To Female Ratio For Elderly:** On another note, the male to female ratio becomes worse as the age of the responder increases.

In this section, I want to use this figure to get an understanding if people who earn less salary (in context of the country) are more likely to participate in Kaggle. To do this, basically I will look into three countires with relatively less income (India, Russia, and China) and three countries with relatively higher income (USA, Canada, Germany). \n\nTo do this, first I will convert the the salary data from categorical to numeric.
