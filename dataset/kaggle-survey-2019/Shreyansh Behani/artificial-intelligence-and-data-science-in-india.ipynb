As compared to past few years India has seen a tremendous growth in AI, from healthcare, agriculture, IT sectors etc. As a part of this there has been a remarkable initiation from Indian government also towrds increasing the presence of AI in India. Since the early 90s, the IT and ITeS services sector in India has been of tremendous importance to its economy eventually growing to account for 7.7% of India’s GDP in 2016. In an attempt to capitalize on this foundation, the current Indian administration announced in February 2018 that the government think-tank, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, will spearhead a national programme on AI focusing on research. Apart from this goverment is inducting Python language in the CBSE curriculum which has sparked an keen interest of teenagers in AI. The result of this initiation can be seen as people of the age group 18-29 being the most population working in AI fields. Not only male but the female ratio has also seen a comfortable growth. Apart from government's initiation, the AI startups have seen a significant rise in the past 2-3 years. Few top AI startups are Hotstar, Grammner etc. The usage of AI and ML in India can also be seen in Indian politics, with political consulting firms like I-PAC using AI and ML extensively during election campaignings.\nJust as Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon are battling to serve the cloud computing and machine learning needs of the US government, the next three to five years may lead to a similar dynamic within India. As the Indian government pushes for digitization and enacts more AI initiatives, private firms will flock to win big contracts – adding to the pool of funds to develop new technologies and spin out new AI and data science-related startups.\nAlthough AI attention is considerably smaller in India than in China or the USA, the increased AI interest in India has manifested itself in the following ways:\n1.Industries have started working to skill their manpower to enable themselves to compete with other global players.\n2.Educational institutions have started working on their curricula to include courses on machine learning and other relevant areas.\n3.Individuals and professionals have started acquiring these skills and are comfortable investing in upgrading their own skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Biblography\n- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/in-the-race-for-ai-supremacy-has-india-missed-the-bus/articleshow/69836362.cms?from=mdr\n- https://women-s.net/womens-education-in-india/\n- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/python-replaces-c-java-in-new-cbse-curriculum/articleshow/63421271.cms"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
