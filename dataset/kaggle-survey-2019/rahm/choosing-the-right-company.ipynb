All of these are equally important. We analyzed based on the survey results from data science community working out there in different organizations, to help the readers looking for data science opportunities when it comes to choosing what is right for them.\n\nIn this notebook, we have focus on Kaggle survey of 2019 to analyze the difference between difference companies when it comes to Data Science community exposure to data analytics tools, ML methods and frameworks. We have seen clear difference between our 3 groups (Large, SME, & SMB). \n\nThe biggest plus with a large company is usually security and benefits , together with ample opportunity to move your career in the direction you want. Machine learning practices are pretty mature in large organizations, majorly dealing with structured data as RDBMS systems use is over indexing with BI tools. ML frameworks like Scikit-learn, GBM and RF also over index in large organizations.\n\nMid Sized companies (SME) holds highest percentage of PhD holders compare to other 2 groups from Data Science community. You can expect receive better benefits than in a small company, such as health care or a contributory pension depending on your experience and qualification. We have seen Data Science employees working in these organizations are equally exposed to all technologies, ranging from RDBMS systems, to cloud computing platform, to deep learning frameworks when compared with overall usage of data science community.\n\nCompanies with employee size up to 50 are considered as small business (SMB). In our case, we have seen these companies employ ML usage lowest compared to other 2 groups. However, the ones who are using ML are more inclined towards deep learning frameworks.  Generally smaller revenues and profits, pay and benefits are often lower in smaller companies. However, on the other hand, you'll almost certainly have more involvement in a wider range of tasks than in a bigger company, along with the chance of quick promotion if you prove yourself. Working for a small company is also an excellent way of acquiring new, transferable skills.\n\nIf you are at all unsure about what you're getting into, it's a good idea to arrange a trial period before committing yourself. An internship or temporary position offers the perfect opportunity to get a feel for people and the company. Part-time work is also an option, as it gives you the chance to try out two companies at once."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***\n# References \n<a id=\"references\"></a>\n***\n\n[1] Different data science jobs : https://blog.udacity.com/2018/01/4-types-data-science-jobs.html\n\n[2] Business size classification : https://www.sangoma.com/articles/smb-sme-large-enterprise-size-business-matters/                    \n\n[3] Choosing the right company based on business size  : https://www.monster.ie/career-advice/article/how-can-i-choose-the-right-company  \n\n[4] Stats about India's tech industry : https://www.ibef.org/industry/science-and-technology.aspx\n\n[5] DB Engines : https://db-engines.com/en/\n\n[6] Trends in the Information Technology sector : https://www.brookings.edu/research/trends-in-the-information-technology-sector/\n\n[7] Top 100 digital companies : https://www.forbes.com/top-digital-companies/list/3/#tab:rank"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
