In this analysis, we are going to look at whether the interest in this fascinating field is there across the world regardless of Human Development Index (HDI) or not?  Lets do deep dive in this and understand more on this.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. (Reference: http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)\n\nHuman Development Index data is available @ http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#.\n\n\nHDI classifications are based on HDI fixed cutoff points, which are derived from the quartiles of distributions of the component indicators. The cutoff points are HDI of less than 0.550 for low human development, 0.550–0.699 for medium human development, 0.700–0.799 for high human development and 0.800 or greater for very high human development. (Reference: http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-indicators-and-indices-2018-statistical-update-readers-guide)\n\nUsing above cut off points, we can categorize countries in this survey data as **Very High Human Developed (VHHD), High Human Developed (HHD), Medium Human Developed (MHD), Low Human Developed (LHD).**  \n\nI presume, it is fair to assume that in this survey, people who reside in a country are residents of those countries or representing the characteristics of the people from that country in the DS field.\n\nFor this analysis, we will not consider the records which has country name as Others.  As we can't determine the HDI for those countries (as actual country name is masked) let us exclude those records. \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #For plotting charts\nimport warnings \n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning) #To ignore warning message\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)\n\n\nhdi=pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-2019-survey-add-on-data/HDI.csv\")\nhdi.describe()\n\nmcr=pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv\",low_memory=False)\nmcr=mcr.drop([0])\n\nquestions=pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-2019-survey-add-on-data/QuestionDetails.csv\")\n\nmcr['Q3'].unique()\n\nmcr['Q3'].replace({'United States of America':'United States',\n                   'Russia':'Russian Federation', \n                   'South Korea':'Korea (Republic of)',\n                   'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland':'United Kingdom',\n                   'Czech Republic':'Czechia',\n                   'Hong Kong (S.A.R.)':'Hong Kong, China (SAR)',\n                   'Republic of Korea':'Korea (Republic of)',\n                   'Iran, Islamic Republic of...':'Iran (Islamic Republic of)'},\n        inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mcr_hdi=pd.merge(mcr, hdi, how='left', left_on='Q3', right_on='Country')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this analysis its presumed that readers all already familiar with the survey  questions.
