Whether you are interested in visiting, living, or working in a country, each country has its own competitive advantage. In other words, each country has some strengths and some weaknesses. This inspired me to create this notebook. In this notebook, we will analyze the data from the Kaggle Survey 2019. We will use the SWOT analysis [[1](#ref_1), [2](#ref_2), [3](#ref_3)] as a framework to guide us. There are 4 components of a SWOT analysis:\n* Strengths\n* Weaknesses\n* Opportunities\n* Threats\n\nIt is worth mentioning that a SWOT analysis is typically used when making decisions. However, it can also be used to capture the state of a business, a competition, a concept or pretty much anything you want. We will learn more about SWOT in [Section_1](#section_1). \n\nIn this notebook, we will use the World Bank categorization of the countries around the world. The World Bank categorizes countries based on their economy into 4 groups: \n* Low income\n* Lower-middle income\n* Upper-middle income\n* High income\n\nThe Kaggle 2019 survey only contains data about countries belonging to lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income categories. There's no data for low income countries (this is likely because the number of responses from these countries are below 50). We will perform the SWOT analysis on the following 3 income groups: lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income categories. We will learn more about the World Bank classification in [Section_2](#section_2). \n\nIn [Section_3](#section_3), we will learn more about the income groups available in the survey. Then, we will perform the SWOT analysis from four different angles: gender ([Section_4](#section_4)), age ([Section_5](#section_5)), education ([Section_6](#section_6)), and jobs ([Section_7](#section_7)). Finally, we will conclude this notebook in [Section_8](#section_8)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n\n* [Section_1: What is a SWOT analysis?](#section_1)\n* [Section_2: World Bank Income Categories](#section_2)\n* [Section_3: Getting to know the Countries in the Survey](#section_3)\n* [Section_4: Gender](#section_4)\n* [Section_5: Age](#section_5)\n* [Section_6: Education](#section_6)\n* [Section_7: Jobs](#section_7)\n* [Section_8: Conclusion](#section_8)\n* [References](#sec_references)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section_1: What is a SWOT analysis?\n<a id=\"section_1\"></a>\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=11uzOHGshUb44gkH-cI9gw2vifrbnSIp_)\n\nSWOT analysis [[1](#ref_1), [2](#ref_2), [3](#ref_3)] is a framework to allow someone to identify the **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, and **T**hreats.

Thanks to the internet, we are living in an era of a truly connected world. We can communicate with each other instantly no matter where we are. We can even move from one place to another in less than a day. In the early 19th century, it used to take us 6 weeks to cross the atlantic. Now, we can cross in less than 6 hours [[5](#ref_5)]. Today, cross-border trade is about 25% of the global production [[6](#ref_6)]. This was made possible by the advancement in transportation and communication technology. Even when it comes to challenges, we are all facing similar challenges. The major one is climate change. \n\nDespite living in a connected global village, we face our own local opportunities and challenges. Indeed, the economy varies across our countries. The World Bank categorizes economies into 4 groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high[[7](#ref_7)]. The is based on a measure of national income per person. \n\nCurrently, here's how the World Bank classifies countries based on GNI (Gross National Income) per capita [[7](#ref_7)]:\n* Low: \\$1,025 or less\n* Lower middle-income: between \\$1,026 and \\$3,995\n* Upper middle-income: between \\$3,996 and \\$12,375\n* High-income: \\$12,376 or more\n\nEconomies evolve over time. Check out the below figure ([Figure_1](#figure_1)) that shows how China started as a low-income economy in 1990 and is moving towards becoming a high-income economy. \n<a id=\"figure_1\"></a>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://dataviz.worldbank.org/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 750px; height: 654px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='750' height='654' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fdataviz.worldbank.org%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;DECDG' /><param name='name' value='gni_and_thresholds&#47;final' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='display_count' value='no' /><param name='display_spinner' value='no' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>\n> **Figure_1**: * Source [[7](#ref_7)]. The economy in many countries improve over time. For instance, in this graph, we can see how China moves from being a low-income economy in 1990 towards becoming a high-income economy. *\n\nAs shown in [Figure_1](#figure_1), economies tend to improve over time. In 1990, 6 in 10 humans lived in low-income economy and now only 1 in 10 humans still live in low-income economy [[7](#ref_7)]. \n\n[Figure_2](#figure_2) shows how the share of world population living in low-income countries has decreased from 60% to less than 10%. People who were under the low income category became part of the middle income categories. The share of world population living in high income countries remained almost the same at around 15% because it is very difficult for high income countries to grow at high rates.\n\n<a id=\"figure_2\"></a>\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1XGzDivLXH9VA3h3E2ZlAiX2vGVYABF72)\n> **Figure_2**: * Source [[7](#ref_7)]. The share of world population living in low-income countries has decreased from 60% to less than 10%. The share of world population living in high income countries remained almost the same at around 15%. *\n\nSo far, we have talked about what SWOT is and how the World Bank categorizes the economies of the countries around the world.

The yearly salary grows from around \\$15K at age 22 to around \\$42K at age 60 in upper-middle income countries. In lower-middle income countries, the salary peak is for people between 45-50 years old. Unlike high income countries, the salaries in middle income countries shrink after 60. This is likely because the retirement age in many middle income countries is lower than high income countries. For instance, the retirement age in India is 60 [[14](#ref_14)].

However, people with a doctoral degree in upper-middle income countries have the lowest unemployment rate which is only 2.5%. In other words, having a doctoral degree in an upper-middle income country makes a lot of sense as the unemployment rate is very low. The same applies to lower-middle income countries where people with a doctoral degree reported having lower uneployment rate.

In this notebook, we used the World Bank countries classification to analyze the Kaggle survey. The World Bank classifies countries based on economy into 4 categorizes: Low income, Lower-middle income, Upper-middle income, and High income. The survey has 30 countries that are classified as high income countries and this group include: the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. The Upper-middle income group in the survey is composed of 14 countries and include: Brazil, China, and Russia. Finally, the lower-middle income group is composed of 12 countries and include: India, Nigeria, and Indonesia. \n\nWe used the SWOT framework to capture the state of each income group from 4 different angles: Gender, Age, Education, and Jobs. SWOT stands for **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, and **T**hreats. The SWOT Matrix shown in [Figure_22](#figure_22) summarizes the state of the 3 income groups in the survey.\n\nThank you. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"values = [['<b>STRENGTHS</b>', '<b>WEAKNESSES</b>', '<b>OPPORTNITIES</b>', '<b>THREATS</b>'], #1st col\n[\n# high_strengths\n\"1.
