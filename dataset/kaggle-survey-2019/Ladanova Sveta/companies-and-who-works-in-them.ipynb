This year, as in 2017 and 2018, Kagle conducted an industry-wide survey that provides a truly comprehensive picture of the state of data science and machine learning.\n\n## Methodology\nThis notebook will focus only on employees in companies with ML and DS, thus, analyzing the answers of only respondents working in the company.\n\nIn this notebook, small businesses are defined as firms with the number of employees from 1 to 49 people; medium-sized enterprises: 50-249; and large enterprises: 250 and more.\n\nAs a result of work, I will try to answer questions:\n- What is the difference between employees of different companies?\n- What does an employee of a large company look like?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Visualisation libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot \nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport pycountry\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport folium \nfrom folium import plugins\n\n# Graphics in retina format \n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' \n\n# Increase the default plot size and set the color scheme\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 8, 5\n#plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'viridis'\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# palette of colors to be used for plots\ncolors = [\"steelblue\",\"dodgerblue\",\"lightskyblue\",\"powderblue\",\"cyan\",\"deepskyblue\",\"cyan\",\"darkturquoise\",\"paleturquoise\",\"turquoise\"]\n\n\n# Disable warnings in Anaconda\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Comparison of groups of respondents in different companies\n## Distribution of respondents by the number of employees in the company in 2019\nLet's see in which companies our respondents work.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the 2019 survey dataset\n\n#Importing the 2019 Dataset\ndata_2019 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\ndata_2019.columns = data_2019.iloc[0]\ndata_2019=data_2019.drop([0])\n\n# Helper functions\n\ndef return_count(data,question_part):\n    \"\"\"Counts occurences of each value in a given column\"\"\"\n    counts_df = data[question_part].value_counts().to_frame()\n    return counts_df\n\ndef return_percentage(data,question_part):\n    \"\"\"Calculates percent of each value in a given column\"\"\"\n    total = data[question_part].count()\n    counts_df= data[question_part].value_counts().to_frame()\n    percentage_df = (counts_df*100)/total\n    return percentage_df\n\n\n    \ndef plot_graph(data,question,title,x_axis_title,y_axis_title):\n    \"\"\" plots a percentage bar graph\"\"\"\n    df = return_percentage(data,question)\n    \n    trace1 = go.Bar(\n                    x = df.index,\n                    y = df[question],\n                    #orientation='h',\n                    marker = dict(color='dodgerblue',\n                                 line=dict(color='black',width=1)),\n                    text = df.index)\n    data = [trace1]\n    layout = go.Layout(barmode = \"group\",title=title,width=800, height=500,\n                       xaxis=dict(type='category',categoryorder='array',categoryarray=salary_order,title=y_axis_title),\n                       yaxis= dict(title=x_axis_title))\n                       \n    fig = go.Figure(data = data, layout = layout)\n    iplot(fig)    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Replace missing answer with “not answer”\ndf_2019 = data_2019\ndf_2019['What is the size of the company where you are employed?'] = df_2019['What is the size of the company where you are employed?'].fillna('not answer')\n\n# Splitting all the datasets genderwise\nmale_2019 = df_2019[df_2019['What is your gender?
