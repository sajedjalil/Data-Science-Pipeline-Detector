Of course you intend on taking the survey, but depending on who you are two different thoughts might be going through your head:\n\n- \"Lets take some time grab a coffee and get to answering some questions\"\n- \"I don't have any time! Lets get this over quick.\"\n\nIn this analysis we will look to gain insights from the 2019 Kaggle Survey by focusing on the time respondents took to take ths survey. We will see if preferences differ between *fast* responders compared to *slow* responders.\n\nSpecifically we will dive into 5 key findings when looking into responders which I will expand upon below.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why take a look at the time taken by respondents?\" One could argue that the time a respondent takes on a survey could signal many things about their enagement with the platform. Those taking longer could be thinking through the questions in more detail, and may value the survey's importance more. You could also argue that those who take less time responding, while interested in kaggle, are not devoted enough to take a survey- or simply too busy- and are prime candidates to try to draw closer into the community. Looking at response time may also lead to revelaing bias in the survey results. Could answers be less valuable if they were clicked by someone who didn't really take the time to read the question?\n\nSo sit back, take your time and enjoy the analysis!"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # for mathing things\nimport pandas as pd # pandas are my favorite animal\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt # pylab time\nimport seaborn as sns # sns stands for Samuel Norman \"Sam\" Seaborn, a fictional character portrayed by Rob Lowe on the television serial drama The West Wing.\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=RuntimeWarning)\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn')\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nsns.set_color_codes(\"pastel\")\ncolor_pal = [x['color'] for x in plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle']]\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100) # So we can see more columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read input\nqs = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/questions_only.csv')\nmcr = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv', low_memory=False)\nmcr = mcr.drop(0) # Drop col\nmcr['Time_Taken'] = pd.to_numeric(mcr['Time from Start to Finish (seconds)']) # Make numeric\nmcr['count'] = 1 # For making counts\nmcr['Time_Taken_minutes'] = mcr['Time_Taken'] / 60","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How long, on average, did respondents take?\nJust for some perspective of amlost 20,000 respondents.\n- The median response time was 540 seconds (9 minutes!)\n- The fastest respondent look only 23 seconds.\n- The longest respondent took 843612 seconds (9.7 days!) - how is this possible?"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Median time taken: {:0.0f} minutes'.format(mcr['Time_Taken_minutes'].median()))\nprint('Maximum time taken: {:0.0f} minutes'.format(mcr['Time_Taken_minutes'].max()))\nprint('Minimum time taken: {:0.2f} minutes'.format(mcr['Time_Taken_minutes'].min()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Assumptions:\n- Right off the bat we can see the response time may be skewed by bad data or people who finished the survey in more than one sitting.\n- Lets assume that any respondant that look longer than 60 minutes to respond is not legitimate and ignore them for the remainder of this analysis.

I hope that this different angle on evaluating the 2019 kaggle survey responses was fresh and insightful. Some suggestions that kaggle might glean from this analysis that might be helpful when designing next years survey are:\n- Consider providing translated versions of the survey for non-native English speaking kagglers. Since kaggle is a diverse community with members from all around the world, we find that english speakers clearly can respond to the survey faster than non english speaking responders.\n- Add some focused questions for students. Even though they make up a large portion (~20%) of the respondents, they spent considerably less time responding to the survey compared to non-students. Instead of only asking questions about what software and technologies respondents have already used, kaggle could ask more questions about what technologies kagglers hope to learn or use in the future. This would capture some more interesting information specifically from the student population.\n- If possible, in future surveys it would be fun to see the response time break down per question. Using this data would allow for even deeper analysis into which groups of people engage with a specific question types.\n\nThanks for reading!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
