I learned about competition less than 48h ago, started coding and exploring data only next day. There is so many things one can do with Kaggle Survey. There is so many things I didn't have time to do. Hopefully, other kagglers will venture were I couldn't. Therefore, this notebook will seem to 'lack', not for a 'lack' of trying, but simply because data analysis is always time consuming craft and without time to spare we need to make compromises. This also means that I didn't manage to re-write my code into separate functions or clean it with duplicate operations. You've been warned:)</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"color:blue;text-align:center;\">Exploring Macro Outlook of Kaggle ML Survey with a Hint of Trends Exploration from The Past</h1>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Following notebook is divided in two parts. This is partially because of lack of time and partially because I wanted to explore so much that I started to take jabs at everything. Take me at my word, this survey is extraordinary dataset! To start with, we have **19718** participants. It means that we have representable sample data and all of derived insights can be taken only with a small grain of salt, just enough to account for selection bias. I also feel responsible to mention a word or two about methodology. Part I mostly focus on macro data. We explore **age, gender, country, education and salary questions**. This served both as a 'warm up' before diving deeper into dataset and to show how big, diverse and also unequal reality of DS can be. **Part I doesn't require much of an afterthought, it's simple quantitative data**. Part II is exploration of a past. **I decided to include previous (2018) survey into this analysis**. Why not 2017? Dataset from 2017, interesting as it is, seems to be structured in a very different form. Even survey from past year required considerable amount of 'fitting', but survey from 2017 seems to happen in a little different reality for Kaggle Team *(yay for very specific selection options!)*. This illustrates few very well known points, **a) most of data science jobs is actually data cleaning job, b) data fitting means data selection c) data selection most likely means bias**. Yes, my data is biased! When comparing past Kaggle surveys you can easily notice a pattern of increased precision with questions. This precision lead to impossibility of fitting data exactly as I wanted for comparison operations. So there are certain trade offs. But, don't worry, you can always look into code (advised) or read explanation of 'what exactly happened here' carefully. We should be good. </p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Key points</h3>\n<ul style='background-color:lightgrey;text-align:center;'>\n<li>1.

Another cluster, formed around Europe and Brazil/Japan/Canada. Here we can see that income inequality is shared also among countries with smaller workforce.

[FiveThirtyEight.com](http://FiveThirtyEight.com) which somehow didn't make a cut this year.

First - If I start to model answers to much I can destroy whatever information I wanto pass, that's bad, very bad. I allowed myself to do so only because question was very interesting and answering it without using 2 year timeline would loose a lot of insight. I compromised on fitting categories which, without a doubt, could be fitted by most of people. I left rest 'as is'. This means that we get someway 'ugly' but informative plot.

Biggest takeaway from what I've done here is not so surprising, it could be summarized as 'Things stay the same, and when they don't - they move slowly'. We don't observe anything earth shattering looking at the responses from community, it seems that ML is keeping it's pace of adaptation and motivating more and more people to start coding **(which may be one of it's biggest successes)**. I can safely say that after last few years of grace period, some companies feel more confident to deploy ML methods in their pipeline - which we also seen on a plot. Inequalities in macro scale are unrelated to changes in landscape of whole data science, they are connected with macroeconomic disparity and nothing else.
