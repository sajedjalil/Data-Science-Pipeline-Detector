One very well-known example is word vectors. Words are represented as vectors while preserving their semantic similarities. Here is a nice example from [GLOVE Embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/):\n\n<img src=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/images/man_woman.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\n\n## What are we going to do with Representation Learning?\n\nRepresentation learning has two main benefits:\n* It allows us to visually understand the data in 2D plots.\n* Learned vectors can later be used in other Machine Learning tasks. This is called Transfer Learning. It is especially useful if the representation is learned on a big data and used in a problem with small data.\n\nWe are going to use Age, Country, Gender, Job Title and Education information of the survey respondents as categories. Then we will train a model to predict how much time it takes for them to complete the survey, their salaries and if they use Python, R, GPUs, AutoML, Cloud Services, TF-Keras, Pytorch-Fast.ai and if their favorite media source is Kaggle. So all these input and output elements will interact to get better representations of input categories.\n\n## How are we going to do that?\n\nWe will train a neural network model on Keras with Tensorflow backend and feed these categories to embedding layers.\n\n![tfkeras](https://i.imgur.com/aPTRfSn.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### First let's make our Numpy-Tensorflow deterministic.

As far as I know, cost of living in Istanbul is around 3 times cheaper than Amsterdam but the same person in Amsterdam seems to earn almost 6 times more. So purchasing power for a data scientist in Istanbul is like half of Amsterdam. This can be explained by the dramatic loss of value in Turkish Lira in the last couple of years.\n* Having a **PhD** degree seems to make the salary worse. I guess this is due to data bias. People who are around 25-29 years old are proably still doing their PhD and PhD positions are paid less compared to private sector jobs. So we should interpret it as \"doing PhD\" instead of \"having PhD\".\n* **Software Engineer** version of me also makes less money. Even though both Software Engineering and Data Science are equally challenging, recent hype in Data Science probably made the data scientists more expensive.\n* **10 years older** version of me has the highest compensation. Given that age and years of experience are highly correlated, it makes sense.\n* The most surprising result was the **female** one for me. I always hear that there are fewer females interested in Data Science and companies try to keep the gender balance, therefore try to hire more females. So it looks like a low supply high demand situation. My basic economy knowledge tells me that women should earn more than men. But the data tells the opposite. There is a clear **gender bias** here. I hope there can be a reasonable hidden factor that can explain this because I kept all other attributes the same while changing the gender. Otherwise, if women are getting less when it comes to job offer, it is totally not fair."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"compare(res, [\"Duration\"], \"Duration\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Duration Conclusion\nDuration (Survey Time) was very experimental one.
