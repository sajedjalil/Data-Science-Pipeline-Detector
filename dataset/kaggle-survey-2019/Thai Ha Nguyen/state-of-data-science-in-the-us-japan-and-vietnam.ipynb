I will use the data from [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018) and [2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019) Kaggle ML & DS Survery, and combine them into one bigger data set. The reason is that the number of data for Japan and Vietnam was very few if only one survey is used. Another reason is I found that most of respondents from Vietnam are students. Therefore, the number of participants who are actually data scientists is not enough to have a good view of the current sitation for data scientist career in Vietnam. I assume that the data in 2019 has a new update compared to the one in 2018. Therefore it is considered that there is **no duplicatation** in the data. In my opinion, this way maybe good enough to take a deepper understanding of the current situation for data science in both Japan and Vietam.\n\n**This project aims to getting a better understanding of the current state various kind of information of data scientists in US, Japan and Vietnam.**\n\nIt will be divided into two parts.\n\n[**Part I: General view of all participants in 2018 and 2019**](#p1)\n\n- [1.1.

The field of data science is gradually proving its importance with many practical applications with the focus of Machine Leaning and Deep Learning. The low number and proportion of data scientist show a potential demand for this career in these two countries.\n\n(2) The age of data scientists in all three countries are relatively young. However, US shows the dominant of the number of experienced data scientist with wider age range of respondents.\n\n(3) The education of data scientist in US is considerably high with more than 80% of respondents having master and doctoral degree.
