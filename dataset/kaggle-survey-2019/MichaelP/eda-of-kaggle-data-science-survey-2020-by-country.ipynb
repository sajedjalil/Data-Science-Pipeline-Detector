This likely includes students. The first few categories may include people who work part time. At the other end of the scale we can see a non-negligible subset who earn over 500,000USD. We can also see that the distribution is skewed differently in different countries. For example in the USA and Switzerland it is skewed to the right more than in most other countries. We should also bear in mind that these figures do not take into account the cost of living in the respective countries. This can be higher in countries with higher average incomes. This means that the income difference between respondents in different countries may be considerably greater than the difference in spending power between respondents in those countries."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion\nData Science is flourishing in 2020. We can see respondents to the Kaggle survey from over 50 different countries. By working through the data in the survey breaking down the information by country we have found many interesting insights. For example respondents from India have tended to be younger than those from the US. Respondents from Iran and Switzerland have been more likely to have a PhD. Respondents from Sweden were more likely to have 20+ years of coding experience. Deep Learning platforms are more popular than cloud-based platforms with respondents in Belgium and Viet Nam. TPU usage was highest amongst respondents in Viet Nam. Respondents from Switzerland are most likely to have 5 or more years of experience using machine learning methods. In India and the USA, respondents were most likely to work for companies with 20 or more Data Scientists but in Brazil, Canada and China respondents were most likely to work for companies where there were only 1-2 people working on Data Science. Based on observations of respondents, ML models were most likely to reach production in Israel followed by Belarus and the UK.\n\nHowever, as per the caveats previously stated, we must recognise that we are looking at the real-world data available in the survey. This sample may suffer from selection bias and sampling error. The results noted here are based on this data and may not all extrapolate to be fully representative of all countries for all of the questions we have looked at.\n\nI hope this notebook was interesting and insightful and that you learnt something new about the state of Data Science in your own country and the changing state of Data Science globally.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and any feedback in the comments below.
