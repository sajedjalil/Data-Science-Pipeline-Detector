Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.\n\n* Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.\n\nKaggle and Colab, both part of google, are in a constant contest of supremacy, both providing almost same set of services with regards to writing and deploying data analysis or machine learning applications, can be considered brothers. And as we all know about relationships between siblings (Especially me, considering i have a elder sister) , there is always a bitter sweet rivalry between the two. \n![bickering siblings.png](https://tiredmomsupermom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Effective-And-Simple-Tips-To-Stop-Sibling-Rivalry-And-Bickering-1.png)\n\nThis rivalry between the siblings is very interesting, It has been covered in many Blog Posts, News Reports, Kaggle Discussion forums, and is a topic that has been heatedly discussed, some prefering the former while others the latter, Everyone has their own opinions, and whenever a beginner searches online and asks the question, which one of the two is better, they get conflicting advices.\n\n\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Notebook is to understand if between the two brothers, one is more supreme than the other, and does better than the other in the intersection of the services they provide, this will be done by using the survey data.\n\n\n# Dataset\n\nIts fourth year since Kaggle has been conducting its annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey. The 2020 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey will be the dataset we will use as our primary dataset, we will also use 2018 and 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Datasets as our secondary dataset, I did not include the 2017 dataset, as i wanted to keep the information as fresh as possible, in the same spirit the 2019 and 2018 data is used very minimally \n\n\n# Methodology\n\nFor our analysis we are going to focus on the two areas where the functionality of Colab and Kaggle intersects, namely\n1. As Hosted Notebook\n2. As a platform to share and deploy Data Analysis and Machine Learning Applications\n\nWe will keep both of these metrics seperate, analyse them separately, and use them to analyse which of the platform is better, Kaggle or Colab.\n\nIn case of the platform's use as a hosted notebook\n1. Popularity - Judged by the number of users who use them for the given task\n2. Growth - Comparing the trend of rise in popularity in three year, 2018,2019,2020\n3. Usage by Coders - Comparing experience in coding with the hosted notebook used\n4. Usage by Machine Learners - Comparing experience in using Machine learning Methods with the hosted notebook used\n5. Popularity with Age groups - Comparing the Age groups, with the hosted notebook prefered\n6. Language Friendliness - Comparing prefered language vs prefered hosted notebook\n\nIn case of the platform's use as a platform to share and deploy Machine learning Methods and Data Analysis\n1. Popularity - Judged by the number of users who use them for the given task\n2. Usage by Machine Learners - Comparing experience in using Machine learning Methods with the Platform used\n3. Usage by people in the data science field - Comparing the people in Data Science Field with the Platform they use\n4. Usage of the Platform w.r.t Other Platforms - Checking if the users who use one of the platforms use another one\n\nAs we continue with the story of the two brothers you will understand the reason why these parameters were chose\n\nAlso, for Platform used to deploy Machine Learning Algorithms, the 2018 and 2019 survey did not have this question asked, so i could not compare the growth in Popularity\n\nObviously, both the platforms have their own set of pros and cons, and it depends on an individual and his/her needs that can make them choose one or the other, but keeping that in mind, lets use the survey to learn which one of the two brothers do more people like.\n\n\n# Insights from the Whole Analysis\n\n1.) Colab is the most popular in the field of Hosted Notebooks.\n\n2.) Colab has had a rapid growth rate, if this continues, and if its competitors don't keep up with it's growth rate, Colab might become the King of Hosted Notebooks, beating every other Platform in this area, in the next few years.\n\n3.)Colab is very beginner friendly when it comes to writing Code, especially Code which utilises Machine Learning Methods to solve a given problem, atleast when compared to its counterparts.\n\n4.)Colab seems to have gained alot of its populartiy in the last two years, and thus the trend of people with less than 2 years of coding experience using Colab more seems to make a bit more sense.\n\n5.)Kaggle does so much better than Colab in case of Popularity among R users, because Colab unlike Kaggle does not support R language, supports only Python and Swift. If you are a R user, and work primarily in R, then Kaggle is the Place to go to, Kaggle Notebooks support writing code in R, and there are more chances you will find other Kernels written in R in Kaggle than in Colab\n\n6.)GitHub is the most popular Platform for sharing and deploying Code.\n\n7.)Even when Kaggle and Colab are Platforms build specifically for Data Science, the people in Data Science use Github more than the above mentioned Platforms.\n\n8.)People who use Kaggle or Colab usually use them in conjecture with using Github. Perhaps it is because the employers usually look at github profiles to decide if they want to hire and individual or not, so most of the Kaggle and Colab users have to upload their codes on Github as well."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
