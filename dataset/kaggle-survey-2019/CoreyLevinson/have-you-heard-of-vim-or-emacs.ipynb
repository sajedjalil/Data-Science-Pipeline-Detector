These early programmers had to write inside of a terminal. That means they could not use a mouse to click to move their cursor. People used to write code inside the terminal using just a keyboard with either Vim or Emacs, two of the oldest text editors. In fact, many people still prefer to use these text editors despite their steep learning curve because when you don't use a mouse, you can type/write code a lot faster.\n\nThe arguments of which is better, Vim or Emacs, are more fierce than the arguments of using tabs or spaces. However, Kaggle have decided to group the two text editors together (which likely disappointed those who consider them very different). Despite this, grouping them makes sense, since they are the two most popular text editors run inside the terminal. The people who use Vim/Emacs as their main text editor are somewhat legendary in the coding community because they have put in the years required to learn it efficiently.\n\nAs an anecdote, my professors in Computer Science all used Vim and they encouraged us to use it too, but I would say > 90% of the class (including me) did not use it because your typing is slowed so much when you have to look up so many different keyboard shortcuts/commands. Nowadays, I use Vim rarely--only when I am SSHed into an EC2 server and I need to edit 1 or 2 lines of code (as opposed to writing ALL the code inside of it). I instead prefer to upload my completed code as a file to the cloud, or work on Jupyter Notebook in the cloud and then convert the .ipynb to a Python file. Therefore I expect that many people do not use Vim/Emacs because of its incredibly steep learning curve.\n\n## Hypotheses\n\nSo, who are these legends who still prefer to use Vim/Emacs? I hypothesize that they are either very old people (which means they used Vim/Emacs when they first came out), or they are people who almost exclusively use servers/cloud services (since many times when you SSH into a server, you may only have access to the terminal; there is often no ability for you to launch an application like Notepad). Additionally, I hypothesize that these people likely write code for the majority of their work day and do not hold manager positions but instead are full-time programmers (because why would a manager ever learn Vim/Emacs?).\n\n## Methodology\nThis notebook will focus on the Vim/Emacs users in ML and DS, and comparing their responses to people who do not use these text editors. As we step through, we will answer the hypotheses through data analysis."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Visualisation libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\n\n# Graphics in retina format \n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' \n\n# Increase the default plot size and set the color scheme\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 16, 10\n#plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'viridis'\n\n\nimport os\n\n# Disable warnings in Anaconda\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"os.listdir('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the 2019 Dataset\ndf_2019 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\ndf_2019.columns = df_2019.iloc[0]\ndf_2019=df_2019.drop([0]) # The first row just contains the column names, so we can drop it.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a boolean column if they use Vim/Emacs.\n# This is mainly so we don't have to refer to such a long column name every time.\ndf_2019['vim/emacs_user'] = '  Vim / Emacs  ' == df_2019[\"Which of the following integrated development environments (IDE's) do you use on a regular basis?

Remember, this only applies to those participants who filled out the Kaggle survey; therefore this population may not represent the entire population of people aged 60+ who use text editors.\n\nWhat is most interesting to me is that the proportion of people aged 30-60 is higher for Vim/Emacs people than non-Vim/Emacs people, yet this is not true for people aged 60+. How can we explain this? Well, it takes many years to get used to these text editors due to their learning curve, and many young Kagglers simply don't have the time/effort to learn a new text editor when there are much more important things to learn (for example, I'd rather young people learn Deep Learning than learn to use an old text editor). But why are there proportionately fewer people aged 60+? Maybe because most of these people take on manager roles/no longer code due to their experience. Therefore they don't need to use something so technical like a text editor within the terminal but instead can rely on using more agreeable software (like Notepad or Microsoft Word).\n\nSince the hypothesis originally stated that \"very old\" people use Vim/Emacs, I reject this and instead claim that people who use Vim/Emacs are more likely to be 30-60 than non-Vim/Emacs users."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Hypothesis 2\n\nHypothesis 2: Vim/Emacs users almost exclusively use servers/cloud services (since many times when you SSH into a server, you may only have access to the terminal; there is often no ability for you to launch an application like Notepad).

The only reason I would use Vim/Emacs is if I'm forced to because I'm SSHed into a terminal and I can't launch an application from there. \n\nTo explore this, we will look at the \"Approximately how much money have you spent on machine learning and/or cloud computing products at your work in the past 5 years?\" question (because high cloud usage requires high spending on cloud computing products).
