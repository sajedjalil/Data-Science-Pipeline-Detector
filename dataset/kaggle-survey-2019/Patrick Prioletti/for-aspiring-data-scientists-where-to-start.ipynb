And like many of the people interested in data science, I was curious as to what the 'experts' in the field were saying.\n\nPersonally, I have a bias towards Python for analysis and data wrangling, as it's the first language I've learned. But, almost every University Professor I've worked with on research or projects have been using R. And I can see where R may have an advantage, especially for EDA and visualizations, but I tend to favor Python simply for the ML, which I think is much more robust across nearly all areas.\n\nAnyways, doesn't matter what I think, let's see what the Kaggle community thinks.

The only point of analysis in this notebook that challenges this notion is the analysis of recommended languages to learn first by job title. Statisticians and Data Analysts are the two job titles that have greater variations of which language an aspiring data scientist should learn first.\n\n## What I'd ask next year:\n\nThese responses from Kagglers about data science and the state of ML gives a nice overview. But, what would be nice to ask in another survey would be:\n\n1. What programming language do you use most regularly?\n2. How important has traditional education been to your career?\n3. Explain your reasoning for which language you'd recommend for an aspiring data scientist to learn first?\n\nWhen thinking about what a data scientist will be doing on a daily basis, it may be hard to envision where you'll end up. And it's easy to think that the decisions you make early on in your career or education will have massive impacts on where you end up.
