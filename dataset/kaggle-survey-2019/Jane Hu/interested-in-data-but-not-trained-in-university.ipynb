I started with my purely-theoretical statistics knowledge from college and zero coding experience, and then embarked on a journey of self-regulated \"on-the-job training\".\n\nIt did not take long for me to realize how serious a challenge self-learning could be for a procrastinator, especially when all those self doubts crept in, \"can I do it without a dedicated college education\", \"is it too late for me to make this career shift\", \"what is ahead in this journey\".\n\nThis story tries to provide insights to these questions using the 2019 Kaggle survey results.
