He represented the law of probability of errors by a curve and deduced a formula for the mean of three observations.\n* The method of least squares, which was used to minimize errors in data measurement, was published independently by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805), Robert Adrain (1808), and Carl Friedrich Gauss  (1809)\n\n\n### The birth of statistics is often dated to 1662\n\n*  John Graunt, along with William Petty, developed early human statistical and census methods that provided a framework for modern demography. He produced the first life table, giving probabilities of survival to each age. His book Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality used analysis of the mortality rolls to make the first statistically based estimation of the population of London. \n\n### 18th century\n\n*  term statistics, found in 1749 in Germany\n* The term statistics is ultimately derived from the New Latin statisticum collegium (\"council of state\") and the Italian word statista (\"statesman\" or \"politician\")\n* 18th century, the term \"statistics\" designated the systematic collection of demographic and economic data by states\n\n### 19th century\n\n* The first book to have 'statistics' in its title was \"Contributions to Vital Statistics\" (1845) by Francis GP Neison\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WbpzSL6.png)\n\n## Data science era\n\nThe term \"data science\" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently.\n\n> Naur later introduced the term \"datalogy\"\n\n### 2001\n\n* William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate \"advances in computing with data\" in his article \"Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics,\"\n\n### 2003\n\n* Columbia University began publishing The Journal of Data Science\n\n\n### 2007\n\n* Turing award winner Jim Gray envisioned \"data-driven science\" as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science that uses the computational analysis of large data as primary scientific method\n\n\n### April 2010\n\nKaggle is Founded\n\n### 2012\n\n* Harvard Business Review article \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\"\n\n### 2013\n\n* the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics was launched\n* the first \"European Conference on Data Analysis (ECDA)\" was organised in Luxembourg, establishing the European Association for Data Science (EuADS)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# read data\ndf_multi_answers = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# helper method for visualization of value counts\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_value_counts(res, size, title, x, y):\n    top_res = res.head(size)\n\n    chart = sns.barplot(top_res.index, top_res.values, alpha=0.8)\n    chart.set_xticklabels(chart.get_xticklabels(), rotation=30, horizontalalignment='right')\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.ylabel(x, fontsize=12)\n    plt.xlabel(y, fontsize=12)\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. 2019"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.1.

The same was in the past and the same will be in the future. In order to understand how data change history of humanity we can have a look on some of the most important events in human history related to bad data:\n* **Columbus’s Geographical Miscalculations** - Taken together, the two miscalculations effectively reduced the planetary waistline to 16,305 nautical miles, down from the actual 21,600 or so, an error of 25 percent. Source: [Columbus’s Geographical Miscalculations](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/at-work/test-and-measurement/columbuss-geographical-miscalculations)\n* **Mars Orbiter miscalculation** - A NASA review board found that the problem was in the software controlling the orbiter’s thrusters. The software calculated the force that the thrusters needed to exert in pounds of force. A second piece of code that read this data assumed it was in the metric unit—“newtons per square meter”. Source: [When NASA Lost a Spacecraft Due to a Metric Math Mistake](https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/)\n\n\nBut at that time Data Science was not so popular and less tools were available.
