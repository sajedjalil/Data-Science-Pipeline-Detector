With smart devices such as Alexa, you don't even need to get up to switch off the lights or to turn on the music. As new inventions are born, the older ones slowly fades away from existence.\n\nThe discovery of new scientific methods, algorithms and the invention of new and powerful hardwares have lead to the rise of Data Science. At present, Data Science(DS) is one among the most used words. So, *what is Data Science and what is the need for such a field of study?* \n\nSimply saying, **Data Science** is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. As the world entered the era of big data, the need for its storage also grew. So the main focus was on building frameworks and solutions to store data. Once that was done, the data started to pour in, at a tremendous rate, and it wasn't possible to structure all those data due to their immense volume. So, today, most of stored data are either unstructured or semistructured as shown in the following figure."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![data](https://miro.medium.com/max/893/1*JeIC6PreHjgh06w3WqkXMA.jpeg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The large volume of unstructured data required more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it. **Data Science was the answer to this problem!** The idea of Data Science came into existence before 2000s, but it is only recently that, with the discovery of new algorithms and analytical tools, Data Science has gained all the popularity.\n\nMarked as the **highest paying job** in the year 2016 by **Glassdoor**, the field of Data science has witnessed an immense growth in recent years. Employers are in the search of data scientists more than ever.

Even by keeping the survey live for more time, the *participation dropped by over 17%*. This is an interesting observation and might indicate the decreasing popularity of Data Science. More analysis needs to be done to confirm this.\n\n\n* The median response time in 2017 survey is *16.4 min*, in 2018 is *17 min* and in 2019 is *9 min*. Looking at the number of questions, it is clear that the response time is proportional to the number of questions. More the number of questions, more the response time.\n\n\n* Larger median survey time means that most respondents have spent time reading and understanding the survey questions before answering. **Thus we can consider the survey data to be genuine**.\n\n\n* The histograms and kde plots gives the distribution of the response time for the survey.
