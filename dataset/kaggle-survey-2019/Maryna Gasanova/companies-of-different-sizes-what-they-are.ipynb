This is an interesting question and a new challenge. What do we know about the companies, whose representatives submitted the survey? What challenges do each group experience? Is there any difference in processing data within each group? What is the difference and what is in common between the groups of companies? How machine learning techniques are changing today’s small, medium, large business? Can we get answers to these questions from the survey? Or maybe we will have even more questions after analyzing the survey data? Unfortunately, there was no question about the company size in the previous surveys and we can not compare nor see trends, nor make predictions, but it is a good point to start.\n\n   >Another interesting question is why does the business need machine learning and data analyzing techniques at all? At this era of data, our world is facing day-to-day growth of information available. Speed of changes and accumulated information have astonishing scale. A lot of routine tasks, performing of which was not an issue 20 years ago, seem overwhelming without external help nowadays. Our brain has its own limited operational capacity and we have to rely on external help at the era of information. We need stock market analysis, weather forecast, earthquake probability predictions, etc. For example, 100 years ago we had few sources of information for the weather prediction. We had a small amount of historical measurements, thermometer, hygrometer. It was easy to process the information manually, but the cost was accuracy. Today, to get a precious prediction we have many different sources of information, hundred years of historical records, a lot of sensors, satellite data, etc. We can still process data from few of them manually and get the same accuracy as 100 years ago, but we can get much better accuracy using all data sources. The more information we have, the more complex task to process this information it is. This is the evolutionary way. Once we have a new useful tool, its spreading is inevitable. Those who will not adopt it, will have less chances to survive.\n\n   >Ancient Greeks were able to fit all science concepts and theirs picture of the world in only one profession - philosopher. In today’s world we have a huge amount of science disciplines, divisions and sub-divisions. The more information we gather in any field of knowledge, the more complex it is becoming and we have to divide this discipline, because any human will spend a significant part of their life trying to fit all the information about the discipline into their brain. But what if we have another option, except of dividing? What if we can use our brain for more complex tasks and leave everything else to machines?\n\n   >In the global world full of information, I think it is a good choice! Machine learning techniques are becoming more popular. Hardware performance is becoming higher and higher. Machine learning is turning from the blurred idea of the science fiction movie makers to our daily reality.\n\n   So who are they, our today’s engines of the data world? How companies of different sizes adopt machine learning in their business model? How each of them use it? Is there any specific obstacle for any of them? Let’s dive into our survey’s data to take a glimpse.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# These lines load all 3 Kaggle surveys, which we have in availability.\n\nsurvey_2017 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/2017-kaggle-survey/2017_responses.csv\", encoding='latin-1', low_memory=False)\nsurvey_2018 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/2018-kaggle-survey/2018_responses.csv\", header = 1, low_memory=False)\nsurvey_2019 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv\", header = 1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"   So let's take look at our groups closer.

ML is a cutting edge of the current technology and no wonder that part of small companies (probably startups) build on this idea. So at the time of constant changes and process automations, ML is a survival tool for small companies. They have their own challenges in the face of inability to create their own datasets, small ML departments, but due to their small size they are very flexible. They can clearly feel in which direction the wind blows and the source of this wind is at the huge companies. Big companies have resources to make deep research, gather data and create datasets, improve algorythms and explore new math functions. They made Data science field less science specific and more approachable to others. They have big Data Science departments and possibility exploring the Data field in all directions. They are able to release development platforms and tools for the community free of charge. And eventually they put the Data science into production. Big companies have their own challenges such as lack of human resources. What about the middle companies? This is the most interesting part of our study. While big companies implemented ML techniques long time ago and small companies are exploring and implementing, middle companies are mostly hesitating. They have more resouces, than the small companies, but they already have a settled business process and they don't realize necessity of changes. So there is no up-to-bottom or bottom-to-up way of implantation of machine learning. We can see up-bottom-middle way. And I think medium business eventually will realize that ML is not a faraway future, but our current reality. They should not resist or hesitate, they should try to find their way of implementing this technology into their business model.\n\n   P.S. As a side note I would like to ask survey formers to include the following question to the next year survey. It will make our dataset more abundant. Thank you!\n\n   What is the main focus of your company's business?\n   Who are your company's customers?\n   Do you implement ML for your internal organizational processes or you put them into your products manufacture, or both?\n   Do you use ML to replace outdated data processing technologies or you build new technologies with ML from the scratch?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
