On the vacation of Christmas Lilly returned to home after a long time in hostel. Alice was so excited to see her sister and at the time Lilly arrived Alice is always behind her. And at the eve of Christmas dinner everyone asked Alice about her future study plan. She undoubtedly repeated that \"I will follow my sister\". Suddenly the spoon in Lilly's hand trembled. Everyone praised her decision but Lilly was nervous. The Dinner was delicious and everyone get on to their on spaces, then Lilly got Alice\n\n**Lilly: Are you serious about what you just said?**\n\n**Alice: About what?**\n\n**Lilly: Your future plan! The data science career as same as mine?**\n\n**Alice: Yes, why?**\n\n**Lilly: Oh Alice, are you aware of data science, it's very tough to stand in that field as a woman**\n\n**Alice: So, do you say that being a woman mean there is some unachievable in Data Science?**\n\n**Lilly was stunned in front of that question, so she decided to explain in a while**\n\n![](https://itbrief.co.nz/uploads/story/2018/02/03/ThinkstockPhotos-851956402.jpg)\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe objective of this notebook to analyse the survey data to answer an important question: Being a woman means lesser possibilities to emerge in the data science field? Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether it is true or false.\n\n**The Annual Kaggle survey**\n\nKaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in 2017 and 2018, Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey too.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analysing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be two-fold:\n\n• Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.\n\n• Comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and show whether are things are improving for real or not.\n\n**Importing Libraries**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing
