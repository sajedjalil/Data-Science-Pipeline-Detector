Executive Summary\n\nWith a focus on the <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> data science community in developing countries</span>, this notebook aims to explore if the community in developing countries differs from that in developed countries. By analyzing 2019 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science survey data, this notebook compares a) the demographic composition of data science practitioners and b) the popularity of different programming languages in developing countries with those in developed countries. Here are the main takeaways from this data story:\n\n- __Representation:__ According to the World Bank, developing countries are defined as middle- and low-income countries based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. For the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey, over half of the survey respondents live in middle-income countries, and no low-income country is represented in the dataset.\n- __Age & Gender:__ Overall, Kaggle survey respondents living in developing countries tend to be younger than those living in developed countries, as there are proportionally more respondents under 30 years old living in developing countries. Controlling for age, the gender ratio in developing countries is more skewed than that in developed countries.\n- __Occupation:__ Among all survey respondents, there are proportionally more students in developing countries and proportionally more data science professionals in developed countries.\n- __Programming Languages:__ The top 3 most popular programming languages in both developing and developed countries are Python, SQL, and R. However, there are proportionally more Python, SQL and R users in higher-income countries, and proportionally more C and C++ users in lower-income countries.\n\nIn summary, this notebook suggests that <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> Kagglers living in developing countries are more likely to be data science learners at younger ages </span>. I hope that this data story can help Kaggle better understand the learning needs and priorities of users in developing countries and make data science accessible to a wider range of audiences. \n\n---\n\n# 2. Introduction\n\nKaggle is an online community that connects and empowers data science enthusiasts around the world. It democratizes data science by allowing users to publish and explore data sets free of charge as well as to participate in data science competitions hosted by big-name companies and organizations. As the platform has attracted over 2.5MM users globally, it provides us with a valuable window on the worldwide data science community [1]. \n\nThis notebook focuses on a specific subset of the data science community: <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> data science practitioners in developing countries</span>. It aims to explore how the data science community in developing countries may differ from that in developed countries by analyzing Kaggle survey data. Specifically, this notebook will examine two aspects:\n\n- <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> The demographic composition</span> of data science pratitioners living in developing countries\n- <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> The popularity of different programming languages</span> used by data science pratitioners living in developing countries\n\n---\n\n# 3. Data\n## 3.1 Data Sources\n\nThis notebook uses data from two sources: Kaggle survey data and World Development Indicator data released by the World Bank. \n\n- __Kaggle survey data__: Kaggle recently conducted its third annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey, which received 19,717 usable respondents from 171 countries and regions. The survey includes two categories of questions: a) demographics and b) data science related questions. The first category includes questions about respondents’ gender, age, education level, country of residence, etc. The second category includes questions about how respondents learn data science and what technologies respondents use frequently at work. \n- __World Bank World Development Indicator (WDI)__: WDI is a collection of internationally comparable statistics about global development with around 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies [2]. It provides us with important metrics that qualify the level of development and economic strength of different countries and regions. \n\nAlthough the ultimate goal of this analysis is to study the data science community in developing countries by analyzing Kaggle survey data, we need to acknowledge that the dataset will be biased in two ways. \n\n- Kaggle users in developing countries will be a biased representation of the broader data science community in developing countries. The 2019 Kaggle survey data only includes 26 middle income countries and no low income country. In addition, as Kaggle currently is only available in English, and the official languages in most of the developing countries are not English, Kaggle users only represent the English speakers, who may be younger or may have higher education levels than an average data science practitioner in developing countries.\n- Kaggle survey respondents may be a biased representation of Kaggle users because of self-selection bias.\n\n## 3.2 Definition of Developing Countries\n\nIn this notebook, <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\"> developing countries are defined as middle- or low-income countries </span>. The World Bank categorizes countries into four groups (high income, upper middle income, lower middle income and low income) based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita [3]. GNI is an alternative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and it can be a more accurate indicator of the residents’ income level in some countries. Please see here to learn about how the World Bank classifies countries and regions into income groups [3].

In addition, <span style=\"background-color: #ffe7ad\">the % of respondents who use Python and R, two languages supported by Kaggle, is positively correlated with countries’ income level </span>.\n\nI hope that this notebook can help Kaggle better understand the priorities and needs of data science learners in developing countries, which account for more than half of the survey respondents. To make data science more accessible to a wider range of audiences, Kaggle can consider the following strategies:\n\n- __More entry-level competitions:__ Kaggle can launch more playground or knowledge based competitions to encourage broader participation\n- __Multilingual documentation:__ When Kaggle is only available in English, the official languages in most of the developing countries are not English. It would be helpful if the Kaggle Help and Documentation page (https://www.kaggle.com/docs) could be translated into different languages.\n- __Collaboration with online courses:__ Many platforms offer online data science courses that are available in different languages and are very popular in developing countries. Kaggle can partner with these online courses and attract more users from developing countries.\n\n---\n# 7.
