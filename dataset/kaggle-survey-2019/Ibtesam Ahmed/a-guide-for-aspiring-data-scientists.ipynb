Jumping on neural networks without exhausting ML algorithms for classification/regression problems is always avoided by Data scientits. More you move towards a complex model, the more assumptions it make. It might give you better performance but debugging becomes trickier.

You should know what it takes and where to look.\n* Having a university degree in Data Science is not that important, a lot of Data Scientists learn from MOOCs. However, it is very important to stay up-to-date with trends in the field.Medium Blogs and Kaggle Forums are a popular choice among Data Scientits.\n* Spend more time in cleaning and analyzing data than making models because that's what people do while solving real-world problems. Local environment with matplotlib is best for analyzing data.\n* Whenever solving a problem try to stick with easily interpretable algorithms before jumping to neural networks. If you want to enter the field of NLP or CV making an image or text classifier with good background on the working and basics of it would also work. You can also go for some not so common projects to give an edge to your resume.\n* Set realistic goals, after making a good profile( with some nice independent projects or open-source contributions) and a good understanding of what you do,apply at a start-up or a place that has more chances of hiring you.\n* The picture won't be that pretty and you will have a lot of responsibilities, but you will learn a lot here.\n* You can try your hand at learning to use a ML product.\n* Years of experience will gradually but surely add worth to you.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
