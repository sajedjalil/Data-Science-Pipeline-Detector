This study attempts to evaluate the gender bias claims levelled against data science and data scientists: are these claims based on facts, are they fictions or just another advocacy to pump up emotions on a particular subject matter?  To provide a veritable background to this study, we look at some of these claims\n\n\n>As data science professionals advance in their careers, the percentage of women decreases significantly. Among the most advanced individual contributors, 6% of data scientists are female; 10% of executive managers are female.” To make matters worse, they are paid 10,000 dollars less per year, on average, for the same work. .............fewer than 3 percent of data scientists are women of colour, fewer than 5 percent are Latino, fewer than 4 percent are African-American, and fewer than 0.5 percent are Native American. \n[Read more](\nhttps://medium.com/stem-and-culture-chronicle/crunching-the-numbers-on-diversity-in-data-science-events-resources-to-foster-inclusion-5dc81d2ab52#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20of%20all%20the,ranks%20the%20lowest%20in%20diversity.&text=Data%20suggest%20that%20fewer%20than,than%200.5%25%20are%20Native%20American.)\n\n\nThere has been suggestions from several quarters that there is a conscious effort to undermine women in data science:\n\n>From middle school through graduate school, girls and women are said to “leak” out of computer science, math and other fields that typically lead to careers in data science. Women who have succeeded in these fields think otherwise. \"The pipeline isn’t leaky so much as it’s toxic, they say, lined with practices that can devalue the presence and successes of women and people of colour.\" ....fifty percent of women in STEM reported that they have experienced discrimination on the job\n[Read more](\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2021/07/26/data-science-diversity-gender-women-stem/)\n\n>The biggest concern is: how can a field so susceptible to bias such as data science and AI be driven by a workforce whose demographic is so skewed in favour of men?\"....\"In 2016, researchers at the North Carolina State University made international headlines following a study where they revealed that out of 1.4 million pull requests on GitHub, 78.6 percent of pull requests made by women were accepted compared with 74.6 percent of those by men. However, when their gender was identifiable, the acceptance rate dropped to 62.5 percent\" \n[Read more](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-harsh-reality-about-being-a-woman-in-ai-and-data-science-cc6a61f9cddc)\n\n\nThe fact that Google and Facebook reported in 2018 that their AI workforce was made of 10 percent and 15 percent women respectively have fueled the claims of gender bias in favour of men against women in every facet of data science. \n\n>In 2020, on the global level(AI and other departments), \"women made up 30% of the employees at Microsoft, 32% at Google, 45% at Amazon and 37% at Facebook. In fact, these numbers have only slightly improved, if at all, over the past 6 years.[Read more](http://businessoverbroadway.com/2021/03/08/gender-inequality-persists-in-data-science-and-ai/).\" \n\nIt is increasingly becoming difficult to discard these claims with wave of the hand and to assume that the situation will self-adjust itself. Therefore, we attempt to put these claims side by side with evidences presented from data using the results from Kaggle Annual Survey from 2019 to 2021. Also, we shall allude to the Stackoverflow's Developers Survey of the same period in the course of the study\n\n---\n### Objectives\n- [x] To evaluate the plausibility of the diverstity issues in data science and determine the veracity of such claims\n- [x] To do a comparative analysis using Kaggle Survey data from 2019 to 2021 to evaluate the claims that data science has marginalized the women folks or that the structure of data science makes it difficult for women to cope\n- [x] To investigate wether the problem is a data science problem or social problem by comparing men and woman responses for both Kaggle and Stack Overflow's survey for the same period (2019 - 2021)\n- [x] To visualize and analyse data for every country represented on Kaggle Survey from 2019 to 2021; to see the true position of things\n- [x] To classify companies according to number of employess to have a picture of ratio of women to men\n- [x] To see if there exist compensation disparities for data scientists when it comes to gender?\n- [x] To evaluate if the expenditure on Machine Learning and Cloud Computing be used to explain the compensation disparity if it exists?\n- [x] To make the analysis very simple for non-data scientist and the coding very intuitive for data science begginers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport

This result is praiseworthy in a world where women representation in most countries are below 20%. We therefore must take a look at what is happening in Tunisia with respect to women in data science. Can the world learn anything from Tunisia?\n\n\n>According to World Bank Blogs Antonius Verheijen(2020) Though the problems of gender inequality persist in Tunisia and the road to equality remain long. However, Tunisia women have a literacy rate of 72% represent 67% of higher education graduates and hold 36% of parliamentry positions [Read more here.](https://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/status-women-tunisian-society-endangered) \n\n>It is worthy to note that 23% is the best in the United States history of women participation in congress achieved in 2019.

The numbers are higher than that of the USA where 53% of total PhD degrees awarded in 2019 were women, as a matter of fact women in US graduate schools outnumber men for master's and doctoral degrees (and enrollments in 7 out of 11) academic fields, they have earned more doctoral degrees than men for over a decade. The reason for the poor showing of US women in data science is traceable to the fact that men dominate the quantitative fields: engineering (74.9 percent), mathematics and computer sciences (73.2 percent), physical and earth sciences (64.9 percent). The domination of women is pronunced in fields like Pubic Administration, Health and Medical Sciences, Education, Social and Behavioural Sciences etc. [Read more here](https://www.aei.org/uncategorized/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2019-for-11th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-141-to-100/).

Across the three biggest conferences in the sector in 2017, only 12% of contributors were female.....\nParticipation in the main online communities for sector professionals reveals even further under-representation of women. For each of Data Science Central, Kaggle, and OpenML, the proportion of female users is 17-18%; for Slack Overflow, it is just 7.9%.....women across the sector tend to be better-qualified; 59% possess a graduate or post-graduate degree, compared with 55% of men, according to analysis of data drawn from almost 20,000 LinkedIn profiles.[Sam Trendall(2021)](https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/features/does-data-science-have-dangerous-gender-gap)\n\n\nWe also have reports of recruitment tools that discriminate against female applicants. A natural underrepresentation due to circumstances beyond the control of the employer may be permissible, but to be accused of gender recruitment simulation in favour of a particular gender is profoundly incredible and unacceptable if true. Sam Trendall(2021) citing the Alan Turing Institute report which claims that a number of examples of built-in bias against women in data science recruitments.\n>...among them a machine learning-powered recruitment tool developed by Amazon that discriminated against female applicants on the basis of their gender, a social media chatbot that swiftly learned the language of racist and misogynistic hate speech, and an algorithm for generating pictures that tended to fill out cropped pictures of men by dressing them in suits, while women were kitted out in bikinis.\n>“Marketing algorithms have disproportionally shown scientific job advertisements to men,” the report adds. “The introduction of automated hiring is particularly concerning, as the fewer the number of women employed within the AI sector, the higher the potential for future AI hiring systems to exhibit and reinforce gender bias.”[Sam

Section 3A: Gender Income Gap in Data Science\n- [x] Is there an income or compensation gap in data science which is gender based?\n- [x] Do we have a company-size dimension to gender income disparity?\n- [x] In the same vein, do we have an Machine Learning/cloud computing expenditure gap in data science?\n- [x] Is this gap in expenditure enough to explain the income gap?\n\n\nThis section become important when you consider screaming headlines like: \"Data Science Hasnt Fixed Its Huge Gender Pay Gap\" on venturebeat.com. In the article Kyle Wiggers(2021) citing the O’Reilly’s 2021 Data/AI Salary Survey which found out that:\n\n>...Women’s salaries are significantly lower than men’s, equating to 84% of the average salary for men regardless of education or job title. For example, at the executive level, the average salary for women was 163,000 dollars versus 205,000 dollars for men, — a 20% difference.

The report was in 2019 which falls within the scope of our study\n>The gender pay gap in data science in the US shrunk from 9.4% to 8.4% over the past year, according to research from Harnham. While some improvement is seen at the entry and mid-levels, the executive level has more room for improvement. However, concerns at the executive level remain, the pay gap widens to 11% at senior levels of data and analytics jobs.\n\n>The gender pay gap in Europe is larger than in the US. The smallest is Germany, at 4%, while the largest is Spain, at 25%. Across countries, however, the pay gap follows a similar pattern to the US in higher level positions. For all regions, the pay gap widens when moving from a mid-level to a director level position.\n\n>The UK has seen the most success in decreasing its data and analytics gender pay gap, dropping from 13.3% in 2018 to 7.2% in 2019. Similar to the other regions, the pay gap widens.

10 Takeaways\n1. Is gender diversity an issue in data science? ----- Yes\n2. Is the the gender diversity issue specific to data science? ----- No\n3. Are there wide recruitment gaps in countries for data science positions in various companies ----- Yes\n4. The higest score for women participation in data Science (2019-2021) is 41% coiming from Tunisia\n5. Do we have companies and countries where women earn more than men ----- Yes \n6. However, income disparity remains very high in many advance economies\n7. Is there expenditure on ML and Cloud Computing disparity in data science ----- Yes\n8. However, the expdenditure disparity is not adequate enough to explain the income disparity\n9. Can the gender gap be bridged in future due to the fact that data science is still evolving? ----- Yes\n10. Are women consciously being discriminated against in data science? ----- We dont have enough data to ascertain that","metadata":{}}]}
