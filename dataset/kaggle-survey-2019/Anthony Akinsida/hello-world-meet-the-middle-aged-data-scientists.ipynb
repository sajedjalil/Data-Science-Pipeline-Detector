How sustainable is this lure - do young data scientist get disenchanted along the way before the Middle Ages? Is there any transitional or fail-safe mechanism in place to help youths navigate the Data Science space during their middle ages?\n\nData science is largely still evolving and the need to learn new topics is constantly increasing. Two important questions comes to mind based on the foregoing. Therefore, is there any truth in the myth that says as you grow in age the drive to learn new things slows down? Can we do away with the experience of the middle-aged people just because they might be slowing down?\n\nIs the middle-aged period an endangered period for data scientist? Are the middle aged data scientists endangered?
