There are a lot of blogs, posts and books out there to help you get high paying jobs or increase your salary. But in this notebook, we will try to look through from the lens of tech industry specially focused on data science and machine learning fields.\n\n\nIncreasing your salary or getting high paying jobs isn't that easy or isn't that hard though. There are hundreds of articles, books out there that talk about how to get higher-paying jobs. But still, most of the people don't get it. Because, most people give in to the two worst enemies of success: they take the path of least resistance (in other words, they’re lazy) and/or they want immediate gratification: they don’t consider the long-term consequences of the actions they take today [1].\n\nTo succeed in the long term in any field you have to set yourself up a `higher standard`. As expert say that follow those who already succeeded in your field. Following successful will help you to avoid any major mistakes and ultimately achieve your dreams. For this reason, I set this notebook motto is -\n\n> **If you want to be successful, find someone who has achieved the results you want and copy what they do and you'll achieve the same results.** - Tony Robbins.\n    \nIn this notebook, we are going to see what **the high salary achievers are doing**. What skills they have, where they work etc. By the end of this notebook, we will all have a very solid understanding of the secret for getting a high salary job. And always remember that **follow those who are successful.**"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def adding_break(x, width=35):\n    \"\"\"function for adding html break charecter in string\"\"\"\n    splited_text = textwrap.wrap(x, width=width)\n    return '<br>'.join(splited_text)\n\ndef percentage(x):\n    \"\"\"function for counting percentage in pandas column\"\"\"\n    return round((x/x.sum())*100, 1)\n\n\ndef one_col_groupby(dataframe, group_col, val_col):\n    \"\"\"\n    function for calculating percentage \n    by one column by grouping another column\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    dataframe : pandas dataframe\n        dataframe for groupby\n    group_col : string \n        column to pass in groupby function\n    val_col : string\n        column to calc percentage\n        \n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    pandas dataframe\n        containing percentage for given value column\n    \"\"\"\n    temp = dataframe.groupby(group_col)[val_col]\\\n    .value_counts().to_frame('counts').reset_index()\n    \n    temp['Percentage'] = temp.groupby(group_col)['counts'].apply(percentage)\n    return temp\n\n\n\ndef merge_multi_select(dataframe,\n                       col_name_regex,\n                       new_col_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    function for merging multiple select question into on column\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    dataframe : pandas dataframe\n        dataframe for groupby\n    col_name_regex : string \n        column name for filtering multi select.

We will mostly see technical skills from high achievers because this survey mainly asked technical questions. But we will also derive other skills from that and other sources. \n\nThe dataset has also data about the salary of DS & ML people. Already, there are a lot of analysis and notebooks are written on this dataset. From [official kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/every-response-to-every-question-no-data-filtering) we have seen that most popular salary range is ```$0-999```, ```$10,000-14,000``` and ```$100,000-124,999```. \n\nFor our notebook, we have to identify a high salary, medium salary and low salary. But how do we identify that? Because the survey contains responses from multiple countries, where salary and living cost are vastly different. We can use the PPP rate or only USA response, but we don't have enough data on the median salary in every country like the USA.\n\nFor simplicity, we will use dollar currency as it is used globally and we will use USA salary standard. This will make our analysis much easier. I know that salary consider low in the USA might consider being high in most countries but salary consider high in the USA is mostly consider premium in most other countries. So the skills we get from the high achievers will be accurate and constant in most countries. \n\nWe know from [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/how-much-americans-earn-at-every-age.html) that average income in the USA is ```$56,516```. So we created three separate salary class from this survey that we will use in our analysis. These are \n\n1. Less than \\$50K: We will consider this as low income.\n2. \\$50K to \\$150K: This range will consider to medium income.\n3. More than \\$150K: This range is considered to be the highest income achievers.\n\n\nNow that we have created a separate salary class, it will be easier using this in our analysis to differentiate high salary achievers.

That is non-technical skills. No matter how skilful we are or how many degrees and qualification we have, without some common non-technical skills, we will be invaluable. So What are non-technical skills?\n\nNon-Technical Skills are interpersonal skills which include: communication skills; leadership skills; team-work skills; decision-making skills; and situation-awareness skills [2]. These skills are not directly correlated with our job role, but it is essentials for success in any job. Let's see what we need for DS/ML jobs.\n\n* **Effective communication skills**: This is one of the most important skills for DS/ML field or any other field. Communication skills are the key to job success. Effective communication skills mean to effectively communicate/present your findings, research or idea to the technical and non-technical audiences.\n\n    We have previously seen that high salary achievers are working with more than 20+ other people. And they are building prototypes and model and applying machine learning model to new areas. In here, communication plays a vital role. Because often time we have to present our work and hypothesis to the manager and other management people and most of the time they don't have the technical knowledge in this domain. So we have to present our works in a way that they understand that. Effective communication skills will immensely help in this situation for climbing up the ladder and overall company success.\n   \n    \n* **Business skills**: Business skills is also one of the most important but most ignored skills for DS & ML field. Business skills mean a lot of things. But for simpler definition, it means the insights, research and idea you derive from data, how will this affect the company business growth and support. Also, for this, we have to understand the company business model, growth and other factors very well. \n\n    For example, we have seen that the most popular job role is to Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decision. So, in this case, we have to understand how our insights align with company target, growth. \n\n\n> \"Data science is more than just number crunching: it is the application of various skills to solve particular problems in an industry,\" explains Dr N. R. Srinivasa Raghavan, Chief Global Data Scientist at Infosys.\n\n\nWe just talked about the two most important non-technical skills that most of the data scientist ignore. There are also a lot of other skills. Some of them are **Critical thinking, Leadership, Proactive problem solving, Intellectual curiosity** etc. These are also important skills. To learn these skills, we need to read and learn a lot with real-life practice. As I said, we have to follow who already achieved a high position in the ds/ml field.

This is the skills that most of the new data scientist and ml people focused their energy on. Technical skills are the abilities and knowledge needed to perform specific tasks. They are practical and often relate to mechanical, information technology, mathematical, or scientific tasks. Some examples include knowledge of programming languages, mechanical equipment, or tools [4]. Technical skills differ from field to field. Data science and Machine learning have different sets of technical skills that one needs to master. In this notebook, we are going to divide technical skills into these parts.\n\n* [Education](#education_technical)\n* [DS & ML work role](#work_role_technical)\n* [ML algorithms](#algorithm_technical)\n* [ML methods](#ml_method_technical)\n* [DS & ML tools](#tools_technical)\n* [Cloud computing & Big Data](#cloud_big_data_technical)\n\nBelow we will go through details about each section. We are going to talk about that differentiate between a high salary with low salary. We have to follow their skills who already successful in this field. Following successful data scientists in technical skills will help us to achieve our goals faster. You can click the links to jump to a specific section in technical skills.

You can barely talk. - Susan Elizabeth Phillips\n\nBefore going to any other skills we need to talk about education. You might say that why education in skills. Because your practical skills with formal education can increase your value exponentially. Though in recent days, we are seeing a trend of MOOC. But we all know that data science and machine learning is a very responsible job role. Many companies still give value to those who have formal education.

Also, we are seeing in the bottom that without formal education a small percentage get more than 150K. This can be true, but they are less percentage. \n\nNow you can say what about MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses). To answer this question, you need to understand that in college you have earned a degree by learning a fixed set amount of knowledge. In today's world, by only using degree you can't get high paying jobs (except Harvard, oxford !). \n\nNowadays, technology is rapidly changing. MOOC will help you to keep pace with this trend and keep you valuable in future. So I am not telling formal education is not important, nor do I telling the online course is not important. Both are important in different ways. But we are seeing that through doctoral degree owners earn more but that is less than the master's degree. So this degree should not stop your career, like other fields, ds/ml field doesn't need some specific degree. DS/ML is very vast.

But to master these, you have to use tools and also you have to have a solid foundation in tools for building algorithms, analyzing data. Tools are different in a different field. For DS & ML we have separate tools. There are some common tools available for DS & ML. Like programming language, IDE's, notebooks, visualization libraries, ML frameworks etc. Also, there are other types of tools which automate these tools. We will talk about both.\n\n\n* **Programming language**: a Programming language is a foundation for our tools. There are a lot of options to choose from. We can use to 2019 Kaggle survey to data to find out language popularity. But there is already insight available for this. So let's use that. [From here](https://www.kaggle.com/strangemane/evolution-of-a-kaggler#what-programming-languages-do-you-use-on-a-regular-basis) we know that Python is the most popular programming language. Because of its versatility, it used heavily in model building, visualizing, analysing etc. R is the third and it is useful for statistical analysis. And we are seeing SQL is in the second position because we DS & ML people always need to tackle with the relational database. I assumed you already have fluency Python or R. So to be a valuable data scientist or ML engineer we have to master Python and SQL.\n\n* **IDE's, notebook**: [From here](https://www.kaggle.com/strangemane/evolution-of-a-kaggler#how-we-analyze) we are seeing Jupyter notebook is popular among data scientist. \n\n* **Frameworks and libraries**: [From here](https://www.kaggle.com/strangemane/evolution-of-a-kaggler#which-of-the-following-machine-learning-frameworks-do-you-use-on-a-regular-basis) we know that sci-kit-learn, tensorflow, Keras is dominant libraries in ML.

I hope you already have a basic understanding of these tools. \n\n\n**We already familiar with these tools, let's talk about something new**<br>\nNow we are going to see a new tool that automates our DS & ML work a lot. This is called AutoML. We are going to see now how high salary achievers use AutoML. A new technology that is changing the machine learning community.\n\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating end-to-end the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. In a typical machine learning application, practitioners have a dataset consisting of input data points to train on. There are different kinds of AutoML available.

Not only that most of the software and other technical runs on cloud app engine. \n\nTo be valuable ds/ml people, we must need a solid understanding of cloud computing. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user [5].\n\nWhy we need a solid foundation in cloud products. Because cloud computing is not as easy as it sounds. There can be hundreds of problem encountered in work. And most importantly you have to know how to use cloud efficiently. Because it is not free. As we saw in the non-technical section that you should have business skills. That means you have to use the cloud as efficiently possible to save companies resources. \n\nThere are three main big names in the cloud computing business. 1. AWS, 2. Google Cloud, 3. Microsoft Azure\n\nThe most popular one is AWS. This one controls over 50% of market share. Many big-name ( Netflix) use AWS. To build yourself, you should have a solid understanding of AWS. If you are beginner then Google cloud and Azure might be a good option. \n \nAll major services offer some sort of big data products ( e.g Google Bigquery ). \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that you should have a basic understanding of all of these services but have mastered at least AWS or Google cloud.

Because once you mastered one, it will easy for you to move or learn others as well. But before completing the cloud computing section one thing I must say from my experience. That is containerization. \n\n**We should have knowledge in containerization for mastering the cloud**\n\nOften We want to train our model in the cloud or want to inference in the cloud. But one thing that we should have a foundation on is containerization. Containerization involves bundling an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across different computing environments [8]. \n\nWhen we want to train our model cloud, it means will have to run in a different environment from where we build, often that can cause a massive problem. Also, in the cloud, we have to train in multiple nodes and for that containerization is a must. Most popular containerization is Docker. And for running your applications in different nodes there is Kubernetes. You can say this is the job of a software engineer. But often time you have to use it and we all should have knowledge in that.  Learn more [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/docker-made-easy-for-data-scientists-b32efbc23165).

Also, we saw high achievers use AutoML for model selection, feature enginnerng, hyper-parameter tuning using H20.ai, Tpot, DataRobots ai, DataBrick ai, google AutoML. We should familiarize ourself with this tool. <br/>\n    <br/>\n    • Cloud computing and Big data are essential for landing a high paying job. We have seen AWS dominate the cloud industry. EC2, AWS lambda are the two most popular cloud computing products among high salary achievers. Google BigQuery, AWS redshift, Athena are popular bigdata products among high achievers. We should have foundation on these products. Because as I said earlier we have to follow those who already successful. <br/>\n<p/>\n</div>\n\n<br/>\nBack to the [Secrets for getting a high salary](#main_secrets_section).\n\n***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">Wait!

We should choose the Coursera for our learning. \n\nNext, we are seeing that **Udacity** and **Fast.ai** are also very popular among high achievers. You can choose Udacity for a whole range of topics from deep learning to communications and others. But fast.ai focused, especially on deep learning. So it depends on you. Your first choice will be Coursera. You can choose Udacity for versatility and fast.ai for deep learning. Also, you can **Kaggle Courses**. Kaggle courses are a little bit different.

That is **Networking skill**. I can't emphasize enough for this skill. This is the skills, if you can grasp correctly then it will take you higher than you can't imagine. So, What is networking?\n\nNetworking is the exchange of information and ideas among people with a common profession or special interest, usually in an informal social setting [6]. It means having a connection with useful people, from those you can get the idea, opportunity etc. But it wasn't as easy as it sounds. It doesn't work in one direction, meaning you only take advantages. You have to also give and share to your network.\n\nNetworking will help you develop and improve your skill set, stay on top of the latest trends in your industry, keep a pulse on the job market, meet prospective mentors, partners, and clients, and gain access to the necessary resources that will foster your career development [7].\n\nFor example, you apply for a job in a great company. And obviously, there will hundreds of other applicants. How you will stand out? If you can get a recommendation from someone inside the company or have a relation with management people, I can assure you that you will have the chance of getting the job is over 90%. Also, most of the time high scale job is offered to specific people, imagine how you will get that offer if nobody knows you. \n\n\nBuilding a real relationship is not easy, it is an art. So which people should we network with? Does it have to the management people often! The answer is no. As we talk earlier that we have to follow the successful DS & ML people. But the following is important but it is more important to have personal contact with them. But how? One of the important sources is the Media sources where they share and communicate. Let's see what is popular media sources among high salary achievers.

For example, we can use Kaggle forums and Twitter to build a relationship with them and these media is also great sources of communication and sharing ideas. Often time many high achievers post important posts in these media that we can use to learn from. \n\nThese media sources are important. But we have to remember that this is a virtual relationship. And, as expert says that real-life relationship is much more effective compared to others. \n\nWell, you can also use the media mentioned above to build real-life relationships but one of the most popular ways of doing this will be attending `meetup, conferences`. Before we mentioned, a lot of technical products and companies. Well, these companies regularly arrange meetup and conference that you can use as a starting point. For example, Kaggle recently started kaggle days in different parts of the globe.\n\nIn this type of meetup, there are a lot of inspiring people and ds/ml and other management people come. You can make a great relationship from there.

So, if you don't have skills mentioned above, start to build those skills and look a birds-eye view of the industry to find high-quality jobs and company and start applying or try to network with that companies people. Hopefully, you will land a high-quality job. Lastly, if you want to increase your salary or get promotion then also follow these skills of high achievers and network with your high position people and ask them what it needs to get promotions or is there any advice they should give for promotion. If you follow these I hope your chance of getting promotions is way higher compared to others. [Read this](https://investedwallet.com/how-to-increase-your-salary/) for further information on promotions. Always remember **follow those who are successfull**. \n\nI just want to thank you for reading the notebook. Hopefully, we together learn something new and important. We have learnt that to succeed in an easy way we have to follow those who are already successful in our field. We have seen some of the most important skills needed for a data scientist and machine learning engineer for achieving high salary job. But the important thing is that we looked through all the skills using real data from real data scientist and machine learning engineer. I hope it will help DS & ML community to build their career. \n\nWe used 2019 Kaggle Survey dataset. It helps us to differentiate between skills of high salary achievers. The dataset of 19K+ ds/ml people helped us to find insights of skills needed for a high salary. Hope you enjoyed it. And as always, thanks for reading! \n\n[Return to the top](#top_main).\n\n***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"References:\n\n[1. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8112865-no-excuses](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8112865-no-excuses)\n\n[2. https://www.arpansa.gov.au/regulation-and-licensing/safety-security-transport/holistic-safety/non-technical-skills](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/regulation-and-licensing/safety-security-transport/holistic-safety/non-technical-skills)\n\n[3. https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/)\n\n[4. https://www.thebalancecareers.com/technical-skills-list-2063775](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/technical-skills-list-2063775)\n\n[5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)\n\n[6. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networking.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networking.asp)\n\n[7. https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/importance-of-networking-for-career-success](https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/importance-of-networking-for-career-success)\n\n[8. https://hackernoon.com/what-is-containerization-83ae53a709a6](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-containerization-83ae53a709a6)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
