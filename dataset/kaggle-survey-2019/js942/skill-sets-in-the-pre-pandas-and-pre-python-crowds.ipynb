There was a slow progression starting with python and R and then numpy and pandas around 2010. After 2010, popular tools, media and learning platforms seem to have exploded. \n\nAccording to a traditional education model, anyone graduating from college or Uni before a technology has been out for a few years is likely to miss out on formal education in that area. Data Science enthusiasts who are in college now (2019) are most certainly being exposed to the latest technologies, and those who graduated recently are part of the modern paradigm where a quick internet search and a few videos can fill the gap quickly.\n\n**What about Data Science enthusiasts whose \npost high-school education would likely pre-date all or most of these technologies?** Are they being left behind? Are they motivated by staying relevant in their current careers, changing careers, or getting better at a DS hobby? \n\nGetting left behind in the tech age is a significant concern for everyone, but is particularly hard on older workers. Age-based discrimination has not been eliminated, and studies have documented \nlayoffs, declining salaries, and challenges in finding new employment. Articles and blogs advocate putting effort into \nlearning fresh skills and keeping up with new technologies as this may be a critical factor in remaining employed and employable. Outside of work, older generations are often portrayed as being behind the times and unable to catch up, as in the \"So easy your Grandma can do it\" phrase we now see from both bloggers and mainstream tech industry giants.\n\nSo when it comes time to talk about who is or is not keeping up with technology, it may be interesting to set the grandma quips aside and look for some data. \n\nDid the pre-pandas cohort learn pandas, and how did they do it?\n\nWhat about the pre-python, pre-web, pre-personal-computer crowd -- are they using online learning platforms?\n\n**In short, are the older groups keeping up?**\n\nLet's dig into some recent data and see if we can get a glimpse of how it's going for the pre-python and pre-pandas crowd.\n\n*Author's Notes: The terms \"college\", \"university\", and \"uni\" will be used informally and interchangeably in this essay.

Is it to keep an existing career? Are some of them looking to join the Data Science fun and switch\ncareers? Or does this group contain the most hobbyists? Unfortunately, the data collected so far doesn't yet provide us enough \nclues to let us dig into that. \n\nHowever, Kaggle revises the DS & ML Survey each year, so perhaps they'll add those questions for the 2020 survey.
