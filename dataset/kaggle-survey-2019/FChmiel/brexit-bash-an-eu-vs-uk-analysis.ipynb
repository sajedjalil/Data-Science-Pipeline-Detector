For example, there are already indications of [reduced grant money for UK scientists](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/news/2019/brexit-uk-science-impact.pdf) and signs that Brexit will cause long term damage to the [wider British economy](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/brexit-everyone-loses-britain-loses-most). From a non-economic perspective, UK universities [face the threat](https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/33/suppl_1/S155/3066079) of a restriction in hiring academic staff members from EU states and the UK as a whole is expected to see [reduced migration from EU member states](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002795011623800111?journalCode=nera).\n\nMotivated by the imminent British exit from the European Union, I was interested to see  how members of the UK data science and machine learning community compares to those in the wider European community. The most recent Kaggle data science and machine learning survey (now in it's third iteration) gives us an opportunity to compare these communites; investigating their differing demographics, compensation, and  education levels.\n\nIn this notebook I will use the previous three surveys to compare the responses of persons located in the UK to those located in other EU member states. While I focus on the results of the 2019 survey, I do use results from the previous two years where possible. This temporal dependance gives us a chance to investigate the changing nature of post-referendum UK data science and machine learning community. The results should be taken with a large pinch of salt (please read the limitations below). Because this survey was not designed to investigate  EU/UK differences it is unlikely to hold much value, however, I hope it motivates some readers to think about the impact of Brexit (and other global) events on the wider data science community. Within Kaggle, (writing this before I have done any significant analysis!) I hope this work supports the inclusive and cross-border it culture maintains.\n\n\n**Note when reading this notebook**\n\n>- All figures use a consistent colour scheme: <span style=\"color:red\">UK results are represented by red</span> and <span style=\"color:blue\">EU results are represented by blue</span>.\n- When I refer to the 'EU' I actually mean the European Union excluding the UK (that is 27 member states). \n- Each section (index on left pane of notebook viewer) starts with a textual summary of the findings. There is then a 'Key points' section with bullet points summarizing the key findings of the analysis presented in the given section. Following this, there are the individual figures associated with each section, each with their own caption. Captions are above the figure and you won't need to read them unless you can't understand the figure.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"UK_COLOUR = '#C8102E'\nEU_COLOUR = '#1E448A'\ncolor_dict = {'EU': EU_COLOUR, 'UK':UK_COLOUR}\neu_countries = ['Austria','Belgium','Bulgaria','Croatia','Cyprus','Czech Republic','Denmark','Estonia','Finland','France',\n               'Germany','Greece','Hungary','Ireland','Italy','Latvia','Lithuania','Luxembourg','Malta','Netherlands',\n               'Poland','Portugal','Romania','Slovakia','Slovenia','Spain','Sweden']\n\nsurvey_years = np.r_[2019, 2018, 2017]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# some helper functions used throughout the notebook\ndef map_ages_to_intervals(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Bins a continuous range of ages into discrete intervals.\n\n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    x : pd.Series,\n        Series of float values of ages\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    x_binned, pd.Series,\n        The binned ages.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    age_bins = pd.IntervalIndex.from_tuples([(18, 21), (22, 24), (25, 29),\n                                             (30, 34), (35, 39), (40, 44),\n                                             (45, 49), (50, 54), (55, 59),\n                                             (60,64), (65,69), (70, 100)])\n    \n    x = pd.cut(x, age_bins).astype(str)\n    x = (x.str.replace(', ', '-')\n          .str.strip('(]')\n          .str.replace('.0-','-')\n          .apply(lambda x: x[:-2]))\n    return x\n\ndef turn_off_lines(ax):\n    \"\"\"\n    Turns off lines on a matplotlib axes object.\n    \"\"\"\n    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\n    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\n    ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')\n    ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')\n    ax.grid(False)\n\ndef load_and_process(eu_countries, drop_non_eu=True):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads the kaggle ML & DS survey results from 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n    It casts to the results to a DataFrame with a structure consistent \n    across the years.

Robustness of analysis\nWith any analysis, it is important to outline the limitations of the work and any assumptions we use.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> - This survey was not commissioned to look at EU/UK relationship. It was not even commissioned with a UK/EU focus. We must question at each step whether the secondary data usage is relevant.\n- We are dealing with a relatively small number of yearly responses (~500 from UK, and ~2500 from EU member states). We must therefore be careful to interrogate whether any findings are statistically significant for this number of responses.\n- The survey targets a primarily a specific demographic (primarily, users heavily engaged with the Kaggle platform). Therefore, we must be careful when extrapolating our results beyond this demographic.\n- There is an inherent flaw of comparing a number of countries (the EU excluding the UK) with a large economic and social diversity to a single country (the UK) with a more restricted social and economic landscape. In reality it would be more meaningful to compare the UK only to an EU member state reflective of its politics and economy (e.g., France with a similar GDP per capita). However, the UK vs EU is a bit more theatrical  so I have chosen to do this. This is likely the largest flaw in this, so please hold it in your minds when reading through this notebook. See the book 'Factfulness' by H. Rosling for more insights about such questionable comparisons.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n>- It is likely some EU countries (only 17 of the 28 member states are represented in the 2019 results) are listed in the 'Other' category and these are excluded from my analysis."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. Kaggle survey participation\n\nIn this section we look at how the participation in the Kaggle survey has changed over the last three years. In the left panel of Figure of 1.1 we display the net number of responses to the survey for persons located either in the UK or other EU member states. In the right panel of Figure 1.1 we display the reponse rate normalised by the respective population (as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union#Population_shifts)) of the two bodies. Between 2017 and 2018 a large (~50%) increase in the survey participation for both the EU and UK was observed. In 2019 participation levels return to the levels observed in 2017; potentially showing either a reduced engagement with the Kaggle platform in 2019 compared to 2018 for persons in the EU and UK, reduced advertisement of the survey and/or greater entry restrictions. There were more responses per captia for the UK compared to the EU as a whole (Figure 1.1 right), but the difference is reducing each year with more EU participation relative to UK participation. This may be the result of reduced UK participation as a result of  ['survey/referendum/polling' fatigue](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/26/voters-disillusionment-renders-expected-election-tough-to-call) - perhaps the UK public are getting tired of being asked things?\n\nAs well as looking at the participation rates, we also looked at the time taken by respondents to complete the survey (recorded in 2018 and 2019 only). Histograms of the response times is displayed in Figure 1.2. On average, persons spent longer completing the 2018 survey than 2019 survey (with an average difference of ~400 seconds) and the 2018 survey completion times had a greater variation (i.e., a broader distribution). In 2019 there was no significance difference in completion time between EU and UK respondents. However, UK residents did appear to take slightly longer on average in 2018 (compare the two maxima in Figure 1.2). This is likely a result of UK respondents answering more questions in total (which also explains the two disinct maxima in survey completion time).\n\n**Key points:**\n>- UK survey participation is less in 2019 compared to 2017, where as EU participation is slightly higher. (See left panel of Figure 1.1).\n- Participation per capita is higher for the UK compared to the (mean) participation per capita for EU member states, but the EU is catching up.\n- People spent less time completing the survey in 2019  (approximately 400 seconds less on average) compared to the 2018 survey.\n- There where no significant differences in completion time for UK / EU respondents in 2019."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# prepare data for this analysis\neu_respondents = []\nuk_respondents = []\nfor df in yearly_dfs:\n    counts = df.groupby('body')['country'].count()\n    eu_respondents.append(counts['EU'])\n    uk_respondents.append(counts['UK'])\n    \neu_respondents = np.array(eu_respondents)\nuk_respondents = np.array(uk_respondents)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Figure 1.1 Survey participation\n\nThe below graphic displays the number of responses to the 2017, 2018 and 2019 Kaggle data science and machine learning surveys.

UK respondents are more likely to be between the ages of 40 and 49 compared to EU respondents.\n\nThere is a distinct worry that, as well as reducing migration from the UK, Brexit could also cause a large number of young UK professionals to migrate from the UK. There is already evidence of this from a a surge in [citizenship applications](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/13/brexit-vote-creates-surge-in-eu-citizenship-applications) to other EU countries from British persons following the Brexit referendum in 2016. While in the Kaggle survey we observed a drop in the number of UK respondents reporting in the 25-29 age bracket from 2017 to 2019 (compare right and left panels of Figure 2.1) and this could reflect post-brexit referendum migration to the EU of early career professionals, we cannot robustly conclude this because of the different methods of collecting age between 2017 and 2018 onwards.\n\n**Key points:**\n>- The survey attracts a relatively young audience.\n- EU respondents have a slightly higher fraction of reported ages under 30 compared to the UK.\n- UK respondents have a higher fraction of respondents aged 40-49.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Figure 2.1 Age distribution\nThe panels (left to right) display the age distribution for respondents located in UK (red bars) and EU (blue bars) in 2019, 2018 and 2017.The bottom panel of each years graphic displays the difference between the fraction of EU and UK respondents reporting in a given age category, the bars in the difference plots are coloured corresponding to which body (UK or EU) have the higher fraction of respondents in the given age bracket.

Gender\n\nThis section investigates the self-reported gender of EU/UK respondents to the survey, the results are summarised in Figure 3.1. Overall, we can see there is a large gender imbalance in respondents (approximately 80% of respondents identify as Male for all years); the computer science and technology sectors are known to have [one of the largest gender imbalances](https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2019/09/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics) and the results of this survey reflect this. However, in 2018 and 2019 there was a slight increase in Female participants compared to 2017, this may be a result of advertising differences between the years attracting more female participants in the survey as opposed to an underlying change in the gender distribution of the sector however.\n\nNotably, the UK has a higher fraction of Female participation when compared to the EU as a whole (18% to 14%), while small, this is likely significant (the UK attracted over sFemale respondents in 2017 and 2018). I'm aware the UK, for a long time,  has been trying to increase Female participation in STEM subjects at school and [success is being seen already](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-level-results-2019-more-girls-than-boys-study-science-for-the-first-time-f3bgjgrsd).

Education\n\nIn this section we look at the education levels of respondents, the number of students participating and the coding experience of respondents. We begin with Figure 4.1 which displays the fraction of survey respondents with either a Bachelor's, Master's or Doctoral degree. We see that a large fraction of all respondents have obtained a minimum of a Bachelor's degree (~90%) and, unsurprisingly, both the EU and UK have a high fraction of respondents who have obtained a higher degree (Master's or PhD). The EU, however, does have a noticeably higher fraction of respondents with a higher degree (~75%) compared to the UK (~70%). Despite the greater attainment levels of higher degrees for the EU, UK respondents were more likely to have obtained a Doctoral degree (compare size darkest red bars to darkest blue bars in Figure 4.1). We cannot be sure why more EU respondents have a higher degree but it maybe a result of cheaper fees for a Master's programme in the EU compared to the UK, a different cultural attitude of the need to attain these degrees and/or a greater number of univerities. \n\nThere are no temporal dependances of note in the data, although, there is a slight drop in degree attainment levels for UK respondents. This could indicate that the Kaggle survey is reaching a wider audience in the UK since 2017 (i.e., less specialized people who have not obtained a university degree).\n\nLooking at the engagement of current students (Figure 4.2), we see that Kaggle surveys have a modest response (~15%) from students in the UK and EU. Between 2018 and 2019 there were fractionally less student responses from persons located in the EU, but UK student engagement remained (proportionally) the same.\n\nFinally, we discuss the coding experience of respondents (Figure 4.3). Firstly, we remark that the 2018 respondents had less coding experience than the 2019 respondents. The 2018 survey saw higher participation levels (Figure 1.1) and likely reached a broader audience with lower net experience in the data science / machine learning fields, resulting in lower reported coding experiences. Secondly, comparing the UK respondents to the EU respondents, the UK respondents had more coding experience on average that the EU respondents. This may reflect the slightly older demographic of UK respondents (Figure 2.1) and the higher fraction with Doctoral degrees (likely resulting in more opportunity to code). \n\n**Key points:**\n>- Both the UK and EU respondents have similar overall degree attainment levels.\n- Overall,  EU respondents are more likely to have obtained either a Master's or Doctoral degree compared to the UK.\n- However, UK respondents are more likely to hold a PhD than EU respondents.\n- Total UK degree attainment of respondents has dropped slightly over three years.\n- Approximately 15% of all responses from the EU/UK were from students.\n- On average, the UK respondents had slightly more coding experience than there EU counterparts.\n- Overall, the 2018 survey (UK/EU) respondents had less coding exprience than the 2019 respondents.

Compensation\n\nIn this section we look at the the reported compensation of respondents in the 2019 Kaggle survey. Firstly, we display the reported compensation values for respondents located in the UK and EU in Figure 5.1. The biggest  difference in the distribution is the UK respondents, on average, report higher salaries than EU respondents (compare the normalized difference graphic in the right panel. The higher values are mainly shaded red and the lower value incomes are mainly shaded blue, which indicate that the UK respondents generally reported higher income). The earning disparity could be accounted for by some of the insights we previously extracted: UK respondents are more likely to have a PhD (Figure 4.1) and are slightly older (Figure 2.1), which both should account for a higher levels of compensation.  Finally, [compared to about half of the EU member states the UK has a higher cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2018&region=150) and this could result in a higher realtive compensation amount of UK respondents. Its unlikely the number of student respondents affect the results (see Figure 4.2) as the EU saw fractionally less student responses in 2019 compared to the UK.\n\nFollow this, we also grouped respondents into three income categories (low, medium and high income) and then looked at the gender distribution across these income bands (Figure 5.2). Our graphic reveals a striking gender imbalance for both UK and EU respondents: higher earners are nearly exclusively Male and the Female to Male gender ratio drops as the income category reduces (i.e., lower earners are more likely to be Female than higher earner). This is the stark reminder to addresses the gender biases and barriers in the data science and machine learning community. \n\nThere are concerns that a No deal Brexit will cause a dramatic [hit to the UK economy](https://news.sky.com/story/live-chancellor-philip-hammond-to-reveal-brexit-economic-impact-analysis-11565724), and so a particularily intresting comparison could be made after Brexit event itself (i.e., after the 2010 Kaggle survey). \n\n**Key points:**\n>- A higher fraction of UK respondents fell into higher wage brackets than EU respondents.\n- A significantly higher fraction of EU respondents earned less then \\$15,000 a year compared to UK respondents.\n- There is a large gender imbalance for recievers of high income: they are nearly exclusively male for both the EU and UK."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Figure 5.1 Reported compensation in 2019\nThis figure displays the fraction of respondents reporting a salary in a given compensation window (in dollars) for the both UK (red bars) and EU (blue bars).

Software use\n\nIn this section we dicuss respondents use of different software and programming languages. In our first figure (Figure 7.1) we look at the programming language used by five of the top professions responding to the 2019 Kaggle survey. The first thing to note is that Python is clearly the language used most regularily by many of the respondents. Secondly, we can look as specific professions. For example, Data Analysts (2nd from top) responded they use Python, R and SQL regularily but few of them used any other languages. Comparitively, Software Engineers (2nd from bottom) used a more diverse range of languages. Data Scientists (bottom) used similar languages to Data Analysts but more Analysts used SQL. Matlab was not used extensively, with the exception of (UK) Students and Research Scientists. Personally, the author knows from experience that Matlab is a favourite of UK universities for undergraduate teaching and this may explain this finding. Overall, there were only small differences between programming language use between EU and UK respondents.\n\nIn our next figure (Figure 7.2) we investigate respondents use of different IDE. Again we see only small differences between UK and EU respondents but we observe quite large differences between respondents with different Jobs.

Conclusions\n\nWe performed a high level analysis of the previous three Kaggle ML/DS surveys, focussing on comparing the responses of persons located in the UK to persons located in the other EU member states. We found that the UK and EU largely share similar problems: primarily, a large gender imbalance (Figure 3.1) in the data science and machine learning communities. We found noticeable differences between the reported compensation amounts of EU and UK respondents (Figure 5.1), and found a large gender imbalance between low and high earners both in the UK and EU (Figure 5.2). We discovered subtle differences in the degree attainment levels of respondents (Figure 4.1), with EU respondents more likely to have a higher degree but UK respondents more likely to have a PhD. We investigated the media UK and EU respondents used (Figure 6.1 and 6.2), media platform engagement was similar for both communities but the UK respondents were more likely to use Twitter to engage with data science media.\n\nOverall we found that the UK data science community is very similar to the EU community and there are no obvious signs in the survey of negative effects arising as a result of the referendum on the UK data science community. We found that, due to the different format of the three surveys (2017, 2018, 2019), it was difficult to draw out reliable temporal trends. Going forward, it will be important to keep a similar format to the 2019 survey such that in future years (i.e., the 2020 survey and beyond) robust temporal analysis can be performed which, for example, could look at the changes in the UK data science community post-Brexit (particularily in the event of a No deal brexit, which would result in the largest changes to the UK and EU economies and culture).\n\n**Five key findings:**\n\n>1. The EU and UK data science communities have a large gender imbalance.\n2. UK respondents report a higher average salary than their EU counterparts; there is a significant gender imbalance between low and high earners.\n3. A larger fraction of EU respondents obtained higher degrees (Masters or PhD) but more UK respondents have PhDs.\n4. Python and Jupyter are the most used programming language and IDE respectively, for both UK and EU respondents.\n5. Most survery respondents are under 30: a young demographic responded to the survey.\n\n## 8.1 How could this analysis be improved?\n>- Additional years of questioning and increase sample size\n- Direct comparison of countries (e.g., UK vs France)\n- Comparison of clusters in the data (e.g., cluster on IDE and investigate education levels)\n\n**Please feel free to provide constructive feedback and let me know the figures you find easiest to interpret!**"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
