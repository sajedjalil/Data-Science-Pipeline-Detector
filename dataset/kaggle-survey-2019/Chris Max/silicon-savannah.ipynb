A Startup Nation</a>\n<a id=\"stpn\"></a>\n***\nKenya has produced successful startups in various sectors such as transport where we have UTU technologies with plans to apply machine learning to create trust in the rode haling system, targeting different platforms like Uber, Bolt and Little Cab, UTU aims to use AI in bridging the trust gap between the service provider and the customer and their technology could be potentially used in Logistics collection where malls or other buildings can use tech for number plate recognition to register all cars that come in and out. In health organizations have come up with apps supporting customer care services and collection of data Health Facility Database, National Resuscitation training among many more. AI in Kenya has also been used to conduct various research programs such as studying the specific areas that have a larger number of people affected by cancer compares to other regions which has been of great help to medical practitioners. Even the Banking sector hasn’t been left behind where the leading companies are looking for smarter ways to satisfy customer demands and deliver quality services, ABSA bank of Kenya uses Julie, a chatbot as their customer representative. Similarly, Safricom uses a bot called Zuri to take the customer through various services like managing bills, transaction reversals and many more. \n\n\nAnother thing which is positioning Kenya to take the lead in the field of AI is the 1Million Startups initiative which works with entrepreneurs and helps to fast track the achievement of the Strategic development goals. The goal of this initiative is to build a community of 1 million startups with 1 million solutions. The resurgence of Xenophobic attacks in South Africa also presents another opportunity for Kenya to leapfrog its counterpart as a lot if investors are disassociating with the country and a lot of skilled workforce which will mean this will go to the next hot hub of AI in Africa Kenya. Kenya has also signed a Memorandum to host the next Einstein forum in 2020 which will be strategic as it will mean exposure for country’s firms and strategic value to the nations standing in the field of sciences and innovation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a>Conclusion</a>\n<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n***\nDespite the dataset being so small, we have managed to explore the startup ecosystem in Kenya in reasonable detail.

Holding the next Einstein forum, leading in startup funding, having the first humanoid in the world Sophia visiting the country and the rise of AI focused startups are all pointing to the county being the outright leader in technology and AI on the continent as it stands and nothing to stop them from competing on the global frontier soon."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a>References</a>\n<a id=\"refs\"></a>\n***\n* Kenya Leads Africa in Artificial Intelligence: https://daproim.com/kenya-leads-africa-in-artificial-intelligence/\n* Using AI as a solution to Kenya’s traffic problems : https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001326944/using-ai-as-a-solution-to-kenya-s-traffic \n* ArtificialIntelligenceHeretoStay: https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/lifestyle/pfinance/Artificial-intelligence-here-to-stay/4258410-5072760-4jr7bfz/index.html       \n* The push towards Artificial Intelligence in Africa : https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48139212\n* Government Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index 2019 : https://ai4d.ai/index2019/\n* AIMS To Host Next Einstein Forum 2020 conference in Kenya : https://www.nexteinstein.org/blog/2019/06/17/aims-to-host-next-einstein-forum-2020-conference-in-kenya/\n* Kenya's unemployment rate : https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Kenya/unemployment_rate/\n* Partech Africa publishes its annual report: 2018 was a Monumental Year for African Tech Start-ups with USD 1.163B raised in equity! :   https://partechpartners.com/press-room/partech-africa-publishes-its-annual-report-2018-was-monumental-year-african-tech-start-ups-us1163b-raised-equity/\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
