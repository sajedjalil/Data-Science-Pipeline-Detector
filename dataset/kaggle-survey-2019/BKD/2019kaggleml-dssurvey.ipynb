The only challenge for me is that I work at university as a postdoc in climate science and although the salary and the projects are very conviencing, I do not have an unlimited working contract, and I have to search for jobs every 2 to 3 years, which makes my chances of finding new positions less as I age. I will try to find out how the chances are for me to move from academia to industry and find a job as data scientist or machine learning engineer. First I have to list which information do I have and compare my own skills with the survey of  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/overview\"> Kaggle ML & DS Survey</a> in order to calculate my chances. As a usuall, climate scientist one has a good understanding of numerical model structures, high performance computing, statistical methods and software versioning. The languages used are mostly Fortran and Bash for climate models. For ploting, modellers use python, R, NCL or MatLab. I have also to mention that these models create massive big data problems for the mdoellers. All I heared about the career shift were based on some stories told of some individuals who made this jump. They most tell me, you have to apply, apply and apply. Ok, but wait! There is now this data from Kaggle. It might help me in more details than just apply commands!\n\n## What are my preferences?\nFirst of all I want to stay in Germany (Berlin). Second, it should be at least 50kUSD per year. With this told lets dive into the data.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the libraries here: \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline \nimport os\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well for me it was important to stay in Germany, so I have to make a subset of the data based on germany: "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the data files in data-frames: \n\nfiles = {}\nfor filename in os.listdir('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/'):\n    if filename.endswith('.csv'):\n        files[str(filename[:-4])]    = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/'+filename,low_memory=False)\nprint(\"all the files have been read: \")        \nfor keys, value in files.items():\n    print(keys)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"countries = files[\"multiple_choice_responses\"]\ngermany = countries['Q3'] == \"Germany\" # you can put other country here!\nmcr_germany = files[\"multiple_choice_responses\"][germany]\nprint('Shape of the subset is:', str(mcr_germany.shape))\nprint('Shape of the whole data is : ', str(countries.shape))\nprint('Number of Countries involved in the data is : ', len(set(countries['Q3'])))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The other important factor for me was the salary, so I have to make a subset of the data based on salary as well: "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#set(mcr_germany['Q10'].dropna())\ntarget_salary = ['100,000-124,999','125,000-149,999','150,000-199,999',\n                '200,000-249,999','250,000-299,999','300,000-500,000',\n                '60,000-69,999','70,000-79,999','80,000-89,999',\n                 '90,000-99,999','> $500,000','50,000-59,999']\nmcr_final= mcr_germany[mcr_germany['Q10'].isin(target_salary)]\nprint('shape of the final subset is:', str(mcr_final.shape))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now I have 266 observations in Germany with a salary expectation that I have.
