A truly grim warning by Stephen Hawking in an interview with the BBC back in December 2014. Five years have passed and now more than ever we rely on some form of artificial intelligence in our lives, either directly or indirectly. Use Google Maps to travel? AI. Use Amazon’s Alexa? AI. Browse the internet? AI. However, most people don’t care about those examples as much as one singular issue, ‘Will I lose my job to AI?’. This article aims to explore how AI will affect jobs in both the short and long term.\n\nTo begin with, AI is a term many would say is too broad and overused. Therefore, let us focus on a subset of AI, namely Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML). Data science is a broad term, referring to the processing and analysis of data to generate insights. The role of analysing data and making predictions and decisions that would affect a business has traditionally fallen to humans. After all, since humans can do it, why change something that works? That all changed in the past decade as the world became more connected and big data became a thing. Businesses are now able to obtain huge amounts of data (whether useful or not) for a relatively low cost. Processing this data could give new insights. The only issue? Humans were just too slow to process all that data. \n\nEnter machine learning, a subset of data science and refers to the ability of a system to process data autonomously without human intervention using algorithms. Machine learning processes the data significantly faster than a human and seems like the ideal solution to our problem. However, there are side effects, notably, the lack of human involvement raises the issue of job security for those who are currently analysing data. Is that a legitimate concern and are they the only people who should be concerned about the introduction of ML?\n\nA general assumption is made here in which the data collected in this survey can represent the population as a whole in this particular field of study.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#multiple ans question\nmulans= {'Q9' : range(11,19),'Q12' : range(22,34),'Q13' :range(35,47),'Q16':range(56,68),'Q17':range(69,81),'Q18':range(82,94),'Q20':range(97,109),'Q21':range(110,115),'Q24':range(118,130),'Q25':range(131,139),'Q26':range(140,147),'Q27':range(148,154),'Q28':range(155,167),'Q29':range(168,180),'Q30':range(181,193),'Q31':range(194,206),'Q32':range(207,219),'Q33':range(220,232),'Q34':range(233,245)}\n#one answer question\noneans= list(multi.columns[1:11])+list(multi.columns[20:22])+list(multi.columns[48:49])+list(multi.columns[55:56])+list(multi.columns[95:96])+list(multi.columns[116:117])+list(multi.columns[117:118])\n\nmulti.rename(columns ={'Time from Start to Finish (seconds)':'number'},inplace = True)\nmulti_2.rename(columns ={'Time from Start to Finish (seconds)':'number'},inplace = True)\nmulti_3.rename(columns ={'Time from Start to Finish (seconds)':'number'},inplace = True)\nmulti.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert(s): \n    str1 = \"\" \n    return(str1.join(s)) \n\ndef item_name(x):\n    languages = []\n    for col in multi.iloc[0,mulans[x]]:\n        lal = col.split(\"-\")\n        doom = lal[2]\n        doom_2 = list(doom)\n        del doom_2[0]\n        doom_3 = convert(doom_2)\n        languages.append(doom_3)\n    return languages\n\ndef perfect(j):\n    nice = []\n    for col in list(multi.columns[mulans[j]]):\n        for col2 in item_name(j):\n            q_1 =multi.loc[multi[col] == col2]\n            q_1.rename(columns={col: j},inplace = True)\n            nice.append(q_1)\n    nice = pd.concat(nice)\n    return nice\nduit = perfect('Q9')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"q9_2_d = multi.loc[multi['Q9_Part_2'] != 'Build and/or run the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data']\nq9_3_d = q9_2_d.loc[q9_2_d['Q9_Part_3'] != 'Build prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas']\nq9_4_d = q9_3_d.loc[q9_3_d['Q9_Part_4'] != 'Build and/or run a machine learning service that operationally improves my product or workflows']\nq9_5_d = q9_4_d.loc[q9_4_d['Q9_Part_5'] != 'Experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models']\nq9_6_d = q9_5_d.loc[q9_5_d['Q9_Part_6'] != 'Do research that advances the state of the art of machine learning']\nq9_7_d = q9_6_d.loc[q9_6_d['Q9_Part_7'] != 'None of these activities are an important part of my role at work']\nq9_8_d = q9_7_d.loc[q9_7_d['Q9_Part_8'] != 'Other']\nq9_9_d = q9_8_d.loc[q9_7_d['Q9_Part_1'] == 'Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions']\n\nwe = pd.pivot_table(q9_9_d,values=['number'], index=['Q8'],aggfunc= lambda x :len(x))\nwe_t = pd.pivot_table(duit,values=['number'], index=['Q8','Q9'],aggfunc= lambda x :len(x))\n\n\nwe_r = we_t.reset_index()\nwe_a = we_r.loc[we_r['Q9'] != 'Other']\nwe_b = we_a.set_index('Q8')\nwe_group = we_b.groupby('Q8').sum()\n\ndata = we['number']/we_group['number']\ndata_1 = data.reset_index()\ndata_2 = data_1.sort_values('number', ascending = False)\nplt.figure(figsize =(10,7))\naxf = sns.barplot(x='Q8',y = 'number', data = data_2, palette = 'Spectral')\nx_axis=range(4)\nlabels = data_2['Q8']\nimport textwrap\nfrom  textwrap import fill\nplt.xticks(x_axis, [textwrap.fill(label, 20) for label in labels], \n           rotation = 0, fontsize=12, horizontalalignment=\"center\")\nplt.title('Percentage of workers who analyse data only, for different companies with different levels of machine learning involvement', size = 10)\nplt.ylabel(' % Number of Respondents',size = 10)\nplt.xlabel('Figure 1',size = 10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Figure 1 shows the trend where the more established the ML methods are the lower the percentage of employees that does analysing and understanding data to improve products only.

Although the percentage of employees who just analyse data as their job is low yet we have to take into account the number of people who work in the data industry; Kaggle alone has already millions of users which equates to around at least 50,000 people doing the jobs that are replaceable by ML.

Due to the relatively field-specific nature of these qualifications, this group of people is likely to have invested significant resources into becoming an expert in the area of data analysis and switching to another field would likely affect their career path and financial situation negatively.\n\nThe alternative to switching to a vastly different field would be to expand their skill set to include the necessary skills to remain relevant in the data science field. Traditionally, people would complete a university course and get a certificate. However, we now live in the digital age and as a result have more options, namely Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are not online university degrees but in recent years MOOC companies like Coursera, Udacity, and edX have partnered with top universities, lending credibility to their courses and certification. The advantages of MOOCs include being able to offer courses that a local university may not be offering, more flexibility depending on course, and generally a lower cost than the equivalent university course. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"multi['Q4'].replace({'Bachelor’s degree':'University degree'\n                              ,'Doctoral degree':'University degree'\n                              ,'Master’s degree':'University degree'\n                              ,'Professional degree':'University degree'\n                              ,'I prefer not to answer':'Without University degree'\n                              ,'No formal education past high school':'Without University degree'\n                             , 'Some college/university study without earning a bachelor’s degree':'Without University degree'},inplace = True)\nplp = pd.pivot_table(multi[1:],values=['number'], index=['Q4','Q10'],aggfunc= lambda x :len(x))\nplp_1 = plp.unstack()\nplp_1.columns = plp_1.columns.droplevel()\nplp_2 = plp_1.transpose()\nplp_2 = plp_2.div(plp_2.sum())*100\nxaxis1 = [\"0 -1K\", \"1 - 2K\", \"2 - 3K\", \"3 - 4K\", \"4 - 5K\", \"5 - 7.5K\", \"7.5 - 10K\", \"10 - 15K\", \"15 - 20K\", \"20 - 25K\", \"25 - 30K\", \"30 - 40K\", \"40 - 50K\", \"50 - 60K\", \"60 - 70K\", \"70 - 80K\", \"80 - 90K\", \"90 - 100K\", \"100 - 125K\", \"125 - 150K\", \"150 - 200K\", \"200 - 250K\", \"250 - 300K\", \"300 - 500K\", \"> $500K\"]\nplp_3 = plp_2.rename(index = {'$0-999':'0-999','> $500,000':'greater than 500,000'})\nplp_4 = plp_3.reset_index()\nplp_4['length'] = plp_4['Q10'].str.len()\nplp_5 = plp_4.sort_values(['length','Q10'])\nplp_5['money'] = xaxis1\nplp_a = plp_5.set_index('money')\nplp_b = plp_a.drop(['Q10'],axis = 1)\nplp_6= plp_b.drop(columns=['length'])\naxa = plp_6.plot(kind ='bar',stacked = False,figsize = (13,7),cmap = \"Set3\",alpha = 0.85, width = 0.85)\naxa.legend(loc = 'center left',bbox_to_anchor =(1, 0.5))\naxa.set_xticklabels(axa.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)\nplt.title('Compensation of respondents who graduated with / without a university degree ', size = 15)\nplt.ylabel('% Number of Respondents',size = 13)\nplt.xlabel('Figure 2',size = 10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"However, comparing the cost differences between a MOOCs and university degrees is thinking short term and in the long term the real difference is in the salary one earns.
