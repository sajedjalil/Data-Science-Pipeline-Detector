Hoping that our topic catch your attention and can give a valuable information to everyone."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## High and Middle Income Countries Definition\n\nAccording to the World Bank there are 4 income groups: low income, lower middle, upper middle and high. These groups are classed separately based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in US Dollars (converted using the World Atlas Bank method). For 1st July 2019 until the following year; High Income Country (HIC) economies are countries with GNI per capita exceeding 12,376 while Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC) with GNI per capita ranging from 3,996 to 12,375 Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) with GNI per capita ranging from 1,026 to 3,995.\n\nEconomic growth are driven by more than just a mere few factors, however, machine learning (ML) has caught attention of economists as a revolution that cannot be overlooked by policy-makers. A widely respected firm, PWC from the United Kingdom (UK) published “The economic impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy” in 2017 claiming that “there will be significant gains across all UK region as an impact from AI in 2030 at least as large as 5% of GDP, and extra spending power per household of up to £1,800-£2,300 a year by 2030”. \n\nSpecifically, ML addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to keep built-in algorithms current by adapting to changes and new data - giving insightful, accurate information without human intervention or assistance. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. Some examples would be online chatbots on businesses’ websites, or social media services and targeted ads. \n\nThe common point for economics and ML is that they are both driven by data. Albeit the process differ in many aspects, however, the goal is the same - efficiency. With that in mind, let’s think about how ML can help the economy? Intuitively, and supported by the findings in their 2017 report by PWC UK - better productivity!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nraw_data1 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv' , header=0, skiprows=[1])\nraw_data2 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/other_text_responses.csv', header=0, skiprows=[1])\ncountry_list = pd.read_excel('../input/income-countries/CLASS.xls', header=0, skiprows=[0,1,2,3,4])\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n\ncountry_list = country_list.drop(columns=['x','x.1','x.4','x.7','x.8'])\ncountry_list = country_list.rename(columns={\"x.2\": \"Country\", \"x.3\": \"Abbre\", \"x.5\":\"Region\", \"x.6\":\"Income Group\"})\n\ncountry_data = country_list\ncountry_data = country_data.replace({'Country': {'Russian Federation': 'Russia', 'Timor-Leste': 'East Timor', \n                                        'United States': 'United States of America',\n                                       'Korea, Rep.': 'South Korea', \"Korea, Dem.

LI as well as middle income nations may no longer be able to count on low-cost manufacturing as their booster for rapid growth and likely struggle to ‘add value’ to ML.\n\nA threatening landscape of inequalities between nations and economies seems to be looming.
