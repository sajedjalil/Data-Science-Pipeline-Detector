After working for several years in the industry I decided to take a short break, go back to academics and pursue higher education. No doubt, it was one of the best learning experiences I had but there was also a huge investment of time and money. Many people often contact me regularly asking about my experience and viewpoint about such degrees. They ask questions like - <i>whether is it worth spending huge chunks of money for such degrees?</i> Well, there is no fixed answer for such questions because every individual have a different viewpoint and their opinion might be biased. The best way to answer this question is to make use of data, analyse the cohorts of people (example - data scientists) who are well settled in the industry, measure and compare if there are any significant differences in their roles, position, responsibilities, and annual compensation. This type of analysis can provide many interesting insights and help in looking at the broader view of the scenario. In this notebook, I decided to take a stab at this scenario and have shared my experience along with the key insights and a detailed analysis of Kaggle's annual data science survey data. </p>\n\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/hD44H00.jpg' width=700>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">Source: Upslash</font></div>  \n\n<p>There are one set of people who wants to pursue higher education degrees due to their passion and interest. For these people, it makes sense to get enrol in the relevant university courses and pursue their passion. On the other hand, there is another set of people, who wants to obtain these degrees only to get a specific job title, a specific job role, or a position that get them more money. For this set, university degrees are not the only option, there are many alternatives which can also result in the same outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>The most obvious example is in the field of <b>Data Science and Analytics</b>. In recent years, university degrees such as <b>\"Masters in Data Science\"</b> or <b>\"Masters in Analytics\"</b> are sought as one of the must-haves to enter into this field. It is not astonishing that Data Scientist is one of the fastest-growing job titles across the globe and the demand for skilled data scientists is increasing. This has given the universities an option to attract students and make immense money. Several universities have started dedicated degree courses specialized in data science and analytics. Those want to become a data scientist or to switch from another profession to data science profession are now strongly considering these university degrees as the only pathway. </p>\n\nBut these university courses are not easy to get in and affordable for everyone. These degrees don’t come for free, tuition fees can be exorbitant and can range anything from USD 30,000 to USD 100,000. And that doesn’t include the actual cost of living. Many consider applying for student loans but they add a huge lump sum to the existing mountain of debts. A common myth is that the earning potential for those with postgraduate qualifications is higher but of course, there is no guarantee that one will get a stable job at the end of it. Additionally, Pursuing a university’s higher degree takes anything from one to three years, depending on different factors. This can seem like a long time, especially when the fellow peers are getting started on their careers, while one is still studying. \n\nThe question of interest here is - ** does one need to get that expensive higher education degree**, **do they create a difference from those who do not have university degrees?**. Some resources online also suggest that one can get the depth of knowledge, variety of skills and learn something new. But again, **is it possible to get the same skills, same profile, or even better compensation without such degrees?**.\n\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/vKFj1mB.png'>\n\nKaggle conducted their Annual Data Science survey and it was full of interesting questions. Participants of this survey were asked different questions about their demographics, profiles, companies, what they use etc. I analysed this data intending to dig deeper into the profiles of people who completed the university degrees to learn data science and those who did not. The focus of the story in this notebook is to identify if the working data scientists with official higher education degrees differ significantly from the other group. The analysis and storyline are segmented according to different factors.    \n\n*Note* - For the analysis, I removed the respondents who were \"students\" and \"not employed\". The two groups were selected based on the respondent's choice if they completed the university degrees to learn data science or not.  \n\n<font color='#088a5a' size=5>Contents</font><br>\n\n<a href=\"#1\">1.

About **one-fourth of the respondents** from these countries have completed their university degrees to becoming a data scientist. In the United States, about 27% of the individuals who were part of this survey completed their university degrees. In Europe, there are about one-fifth of respondents who completed their university degrees while in Asia, the percentage is a bit lower only about 15%.  \n- Countries with the highest proportion of data scientists with university degrees are **'Tunisia', 'Austria', 'New Zealand' and 'Greece'** with **over 40% of the individuals** completing university degrees. On the other hand, countries **'Japan', 'Nigeria', 'Belarus', and 'Algeria'** shows a lower number (less than 10%) of individuals completing university degrees.   \n- Among the genders, female respondents have a higher number for completing university degrees than male respondents. **23% of the female respondents** and 20% of the male respondents completed their university degrees.    \n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n<font color='#088a5a' size=5>3. Are there Significant Differences - With or Without University Degrees ?</font><br> \n\nAccording to Forbes, Most people with data science job titles don’t have these new degrees. I also looked at the profiles of a few data scientist in my Linkedin Network and observed that not all of them have data science degrees. People tend to take different paths - some have degrees in business, economics, maths etc, while some have specialed data science degrees, and some have no university degree. But all of them are working in good organizations with good job roles. In the next section, let's look at the key insights from the Survey Data Analysis. The focus of the analysis is to compare the two groups -  individuals who completed university degree vs those without for becoming a data scientist and identify key differences (if any).\n\nMainly, We will look at three perspectives: Are there a fairly equal percentage of individuals from two groups:\n\n1. With every compensation bracket.   \n2. For each type of job role or activity.   \n3. For each type of activity, they do daily.   \n\n<div id=\"31\"></div>\n<font color='#088a5a' size=5>3.1 Compensation </font><br> "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"col_yes = \"#fad46b\"\ncol_no = \"#97c6e8\"\n\ndef compute_stats(df, col, xaxis=None):\n    agg_df = df[col].value_counts().to_frame()\n    total = sum(agg_df[col])\n    agg_df['percent'] = agg_df[col].apply(lambda x : 100*x / total)\n    agg_df = agg_df.reset_index().rename(columns = {col: \"count\", 'index' : col})\n    agg_doc = {}\n    if xaxis != None:\n        for _ in xaxis:\n            try:\n                agg_doc[_] = agg_df[agg_df[col] == _]['percent'].iloc(0)[0]\n            except:\n                agg_doc[_] = 0\n    return agg_doc\n\ndef plot_ver_bars(c, ht=500, annot = True):\n    dxf1 = df1[df1['Q5'].isin([\"Data Scientist\"])]\n    dxf2 = df2[df2['Q5'].isin([\"Data Scientist\"])]\n\n    count_df1 = dxf1[dxf1[\"Q3\"].isin([c])]\n    count_df2 = dxf2[dxf2[\"Q3\"].isin([c])]\n    col = \"Q10\"\n    xaxis = [\"$0-999\", \"1,000-1,999\", \"2,000-2,999\", \"3,000-3,999\", \"4,000-4,999\", \"5,000-7,499\", \"7,500-9,999\", \"10,000-14,999\", \"15,000-19,999\", \"20,000-24,999\", \"25,000-29,999\", \"30,000-39,999\", \"40,000-49,999\", \"50,000-59,999\", \"60,000-69,999\", \"70,000-79,999\", \"80,000-89,999\", \"90,000-99,999\", \"100,000-124,999\", \"125,000-149,999\", \"150,000-199,999\", \"200,000-249,999\", \"250,000-299,999\", \"300,000-500,000\", \"> $500,000\"]\n    t1_doc = compute_stats(count_df1, col, xaxis=xaxis)\n    t2_doc = compute_stats(count_df2, col, xaxis=xaxis)\n\n    ## plot the bar chart\n    xaxis1 = [\"$0K\", \"1 - 1K\", \"2 - 2K\", \"3 - 3K\", \"4 - 4K\", \"5 - 7.5K\", \"7.5 - 10K\", \"10 - 15K\", \"15 - 20K\", \"20 - 25K\", \"25 - 30K\", \"30 - 40K\", \"40 - 50K\", \"50 - 60K\", \"60 - 70K\", \"70 - 80K\", \"80 - 90K\", \"90 - 100K\", \"100 - 125K\", \"125 - 150K\", \"150 - 200K\", \"200 - 250K\", \"250 - 300K\", \"300 - 500K\", \"> $500K\"]\n    fig = go.Figure(data=[\n                go.Bar(name='Without University Degree', x=xaxis1[7:], y=[t2_doc[_] for _ in xaxis][7:], marker=dict(color=col_no, opacity=0.8)),\n                go.Bar(name='With University Degree', x=xaxis1[7:], y=[t1_doc[_] for _ in xaxis][7:], marker=dict(color=col_yes, opacity=0.8))])\n    fig.update_layout(barmode='group', title=\"Data Scientists in <b>\"+c+\"</b>\", \n                      yaxis = dict(title=\"% of respondents\"), xaxis = dict(title=\"US$\"), height=ht,\n                      legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.01, y=1.1), plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff')\n                                 \n    fig.update_xaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False)\n    fig.update_yaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False)\n    if annot == True:\n        fig.update_layout(annotations=[go.layout.Annotation(x=15.5, y=13, xref=\"x\", yref=\"y\", \n                                                       text=\"More % of Individuals <br> Without University Degrees <br>Earning > $150K\", \n                                                       showarrow=True, arrowhead=7, ax=0, ay=-40), \n                                 go.layout.Annotation(x=11, y=24, xref=\"x\", yref=\"y\", \n                                                       text=\"With University Degrees <br> Earning More\", \n                                                       showarrow=True, arrowhead=7, ax=0, ay=-40)])\n        fig.add_shape(go.layout.Shape(\n                    type=\"rect\",\n                    xref=\"x\",\n                    yref=\"paper\",\n                    x0=12.5,\n                    x1=17.5,\n                    y0=0.03,\n                    y1=1,\n                    fillcolor=\"red\",\n                    opacity=0.1,\n                    layer=\"below\",\n                    line_width=0))\n        fig.add_shape(go.layout.Shape(\n                    type=\"rect\",\n                    xref=\"x\",\n                    yref=\"paper\",\n                    x0=10.5,\n                    x1=12.4,\n                    y0=0.5,\n                    y1=1,\n                    fillcolor=\"green\",\n                    opacity=0.1,\n                    layer=\"below\",\n                    line_width=0))\n    \n    \n    fig.show()\n    return count_df1, count_df2\n\nnations = [\"United States of America\", \"Germany\"]\nc1, c2 = plot_ver_bars(nations[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plot shows the percentage of respondents from the United States of America in each compensation bracket. Looking at every bucket, it is clear that there are no significant differences between the two groups. Approximately they differ by a few per cent (less than 5). However, a few sections in this chart are very interesting. \n\n- A common belief about university degrees is that one get higher compensation. The chart shows that there is a large percentage of individuals **without a university degree also earning more than 100K USD**. Even without university degrees, if individuals manage to obtain the right skills and the right direction, one can also grab high compensation. That's where Kaggle Learn or Coursera are the best options. As they provide the pathway to get the appropriate skills required to become a data scientist.\n- There are slight differences when the compensation is less than 125K. For this range, there is a higher percentage of individuals having university degrees. The area is shown in the green section in the chart. Well, this compensation range is the average of most of the companies in USA. This means that university degrees in data science can give an initial boost to the candidates in the compensation.  \n- Very Interesting to note that there are more percentage of respondents without university degrees than those who have who are earning in the range of USD 150K-300K. This area is highlighted in red. This implies that there are definately ways to get higher compensation not necessarily after obtaining a masters in data science degree. The obvious reasons can be the amount of experience, age group, or special talent. It will be interesting to specifically look into this cohort where data scientists earn >150K USD.

This plot shows, for a particular group (degree or non-degree holders), which activity has more importance.

The biggest differences are observed for data scientists who do \"Data Analysis or Exploration\", and performing \"Research and developing State of the art models\". Since experimentation is always a big part of any data science project, there exists very less differences in the % of respondents of two groups.     \n- The percentage of non-degree holder respondents is always lesser than the counterpart, however, the differences are not extreme. There is still a significant percentage of people who are involved in similar responsibilities as the university holders. Hence, it will be wrong to say that only university holders do a particular type of activities or have specialized activities.   \n- Plot B shows a higher percentage of people with university degrees selected being involved in **Research work, Data Analysis, and Building/Running Infrastructures**. While a slightly more percentage of people without university degrees selected being involved in Experimentation and Building Machine Learning services.  \n- A fairly equal percentage is observed for people who build Machine Learning service despite their degrees.

In this particular task, we aim to identify what are the most important signals strongly related to university degree holders. To identify these signals, we will treat this task as a predictive modelling problem. The first step is to prepare dataset which includes creating the train and test sets. Next, a simple learning classifier will be trained on the dataset the features are information about the individuals (demographics, tools used, company info etc.) and the target determines if the individual completed the university degree or not. All of the features and the target are binary. After the model is trained with a decent evaluation metric score, the important features of the model are obtained using Permutation Importance. These features provide some sense about their importance with an order or ranking.

The insights presented in this notebook, convey a broad message about the importance of \"masters in data science degrees\". We can observe that it is not impossible to achieve certain job roles or position and even compensation without any degree in data science/analytics. In <a href=\"#31\">Section 3</a> we saw that there are as many as self-made data scientists (without any degree) earning similar compensation as with the degree holders. The case is not just restricted to the USA but also true in many other countries. This means that organizations value skills and talent over any degree, that's why they pay huge chunks of money for that skill. We also <a href=\"#32\">observed</a> that there are no major distinctions in the type of work individuals in this field do on a daily basis, everyone has to spend a good amount of time in data analysis and cleaning, There are almost equal percentage of respondents who build machine learning services, prototypes and also do experimentation. \n\nIt might be wrong to strongly say that it’s not worth it all. There are many positives associated with it as well: One can get edge during job hunt over those who do not have masters degree, one can establish their network with professors, fellow students, and industry partners, one can get exposure to many new areas, and can polish a lot of skills. Academic institutions are responding to a market demand and generating programs, due to it. It is possible that what students learn might be very different from what a data scientist does.\n\nJeremy Howard said the following in a [reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2p6k20/im_jeremy_howard_enlitic_ceo_kaggle_past/cmty7kf/): \n> There is nothing that you could learn in a master of computer science that you could not learn in an online course, or by reading books. However, if you need the structure or motivation of a formal course, all the social interaction with other students, you may find that useful. I think that online courses are the best way to go if you can, because you can access the world's best teachers, and have a much more interactive learning environment — for example the use of short quizzes scattered throughout each lecture.\n> Specifically, the courses that I would recommend our the machine learning course on Coursera, the introduction to data science course on Coursera, and the neural networks for machine learning course — surprise surprise, also on Coursera! Also, all of the introductory books here are a good choice.\n> The most important thing, of course, is to practice download some open datasets from the web, and try to build models and develop insights, and post them on your blog. And be sure to compete in machine learning competitions — that's the only way to know whether your approaches are working or not.\n\nThe key takeaway is that one can become a data scientist (or any other similar position in this field) with right skills and can also manage to get decent compensation even without going through \"Masters in Data Science (or similar degrees)\". There are many alternatives - Coursera, Kaggle, Udemy, Udacity, eDX, Linkedin Learning, Fast.ai to name a few. These resources are either completely free or are much cheaper than dedicated university degrees. Additionally, one can complete these courses in a much shorter time as compared to the university courses. If there are any other reasons for the desire to pursuing masters, example - personal goals, passion, interest, utilizing the breaks etc, one should consider pursuing university courses.\n\nIf someone is thinking of getting a degree, in data science, analytics, just because they have the time and money to spare, is not wise. If the interest in analytics is driven by the desire for a job that offers better rewards than what they are getting now, then one should look for alternative paths to make that career move. [Meta S Brown from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2016/07/29/4-reasons-not-to-get-that-masters-in-data-science/#4813020640c0) says, \"At the end, we need to remember that Data Scientist is a Title. Many give themselves or have this title because that's the work they do, not because they have a particular degree\". \n\nIt's just about taking the first step, start studying from online courses, do relevant projects, start making kaggle contributions, and keep improving your resume and profile. In the end, whatever path someone takes, they will most likely produce similar outcomes. The following Sankey depicts this message very well.

If someone wants to learn data science skills <b>only</b>, then no its not worth it because there are many excellent free / cheaper alternatives on the internet. Kaggle is an excellent place to start.    \n2. If someone wants to work as a data scientist (fresher or career change), then it may or may not be worth it because there is no gurantee that one will get a data science job after the university degree. A non degree holder with right skillset, right experience, and right attitude may get a better job than the one with a degree title.  \n3. If someone wants to earn more, then it is not necessary to have university degree, as one with good experience or good skills can grab very high compensation packages.  \n4. If someone wants to do more research, then it may be worth it given that one chooses a right specialization.  \n4. If someone is passionate to learn more and gain exposure then it is definately worth it. University degree can provide a platform to network, participate in different events, and improve the foundation.  \n\n<div id=\"6\"></div>\n<font color='#088a5a' size=5>References </font><br>  \n\n1. https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2016/07/29/4-reasons-not-to-get-that-masters-in-data-science/#6b43eb2140c0\n2. https://www.mybaggage.com/blog/why-do-a-masters-degree-the-pros-and-cons/\n3. https://e2i.com.sg/can-you-thrive-without-a-degree-in-singapore/\n4. https://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/06/masters-degree-become-data-scientist.html\n5. https://medium.com/@LiuhuayingYANG/is-your-income-lower-than-others-3d20f9e579bc\n6. https://www.quora.com/Is-a-masters-in-Data-Science-worth-it\n7. https://towardsdatascience.com/was-it-worth-studying-a-data-science-masters-c469e5b3e020\n8. https://www.cleverism.com/4-reasons-not-to-get-that-masters-in-data-science/\n9. https://www.kaggle.com/general/61082\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
