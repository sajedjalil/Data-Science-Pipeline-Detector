With the release of the 2019 Kaggle survey, I thought: \"Why don't I seek for answers about about becoming a data scientist like a data scienst would? Using data!\" \n\nThrough my first ever attempt at a Kaggle competion, I will attempt to answer the question: \"What does it take for a student to evolve into a data scientist\". I will accomplish this by using the survey data to explore the difference in education and toolkit between the 2 subgroups of 'Students' and 'Data Scientists'.

If you want to aim for a salary of $100,000+ a year, you are probably more likely to find it in North America or Oceania. \n* While many believe that data scientists will have to do some machine learning, their role is also as much about understanding data to influence business decisions\n* Most data scientists are relative young, so it is a role that many students can aim to pursue right after they graduate. \n* However, many data scientists hold a Master's degree, so it would be wise to consider pursuing one in your path to becoming a data scientist. \n* Data scientists have a wide selection of media sources for data science information. As a student, you should consider exploring your sources too. \n* In term of data science toolkit, Jupyter, Kaggle Kernels, Google Colab, Python, R, SQL, Matploblib and Seaborn are expected items for a data scientists. \n* Any students learning machine learning should pay attention to linear regression, decision tree/random forest as well as Boosted Gradient Machines.
