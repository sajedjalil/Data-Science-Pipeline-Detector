When it comes to learning we are at par with our rest of the world contemporizes , Kaggle, Coursera and Python and it's related framework/tools are our choice of learning.*\n\n*Now , Let's discuss <a>What needs to be improved ?</a> . In 2019 also not many women are turning into STEM/Data Science , if we want flourishing Data Science industry in India then there should be gender diversity.*\n\n*Not lot of people are turning up for higher education , this can affect the quality of upcoming data science engineer. I think this could be the possible reason behind not much 'Statistician' job title in India .There is no replacement of university degree and for upcoming breed of data scientist success this is much required.*\n\n*As established that Data Science belongs to young generation , but it needs experienced professional also. People with good range of experience from other technical domain  should also try their hand in data science field. This will bring diversity and experience , young blood is full of energy and enthusiasm but it needs right direction which can come from experience and expertise*\n\nWell folks , I will rest my case now.
