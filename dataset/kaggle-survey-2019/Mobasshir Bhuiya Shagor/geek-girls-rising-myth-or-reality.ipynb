The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. Also, it is important to note here that when women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked. Thus, our voices will only be heard when we have decent participation in society. \nThe iconic photograph of **Katie Bowman in 2019**, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed, has inspired a lot of women.\n\n![](https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sizes/katieboumanfacebookmain_resize_md.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, women like Grace Hopper, Marie Curie, Margaret Hamilton, and many other immensely talented females have been continuously regarded as idols and icons by many. They have time and again inspired us to follow our passions and do something incredible. And it's not like women haven't been making significant contributions to IT for decades. Still, women are substantially represented in STEM fields.\nA lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme **#BalanceforBetter**, advocating a more gender-balanced world.\n\n### So,have we achieved parity. Are things improving?\nThe 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether things seem to be actually improving or is still much left to be done. Let the numbers speak for themselves.\n\n# What is the annual Kaggle survey\n\nKaggle annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in [2017](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) and [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/), Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey also.\n\n# Objective\nThe objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving or is it just a hype?\n\n# Methodology\nThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analyzing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be done in two steps:\n\n* Step 1 will comprise of the analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.\n* Step 2 shall consist of the comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and will show whether are things are improving or not.\n\nIn this notebook, we shall analyze the female participation in the survey under 5 different categories, namely:\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*US4fqDrQqfEMfFm_MSxWkg.png)\n\n* Demographics\n* Education \n* Professional Experience \n* Job Role\n* Salary"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Disable warnings in Anaconda\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\n\n# Graphics in retina format are more sharp and legible\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' \n\n# Increase the default plot size and set the color scheme\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 8, 5\nplt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'viridis'\n\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport pycountry\n\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot \ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nimport folium \nfrom folium import plugins\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the 2019 Dataset\ndf_2019 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\ndf_2019.columns = df_2019.iloc[0]\ndf_2019=df_2019.drop([0])\n\ndf_2018 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2018/multipleChoiceResponses.csv')\ndf_2018.columns = df_2018.iloc[0]\ndf_2018=df_2018.drop([0])\n\ndf_2017=pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2017/multipleChoiceResponses.csv',encoding='ISO-8859-1')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The State of Affairs Today - 2019"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Total respondents in 2019:',df_2019.shape[0])\n\nmale_2019 = df_2019[df_2019['What is your gender? - Selected Choice']=='Male']\nfemale_2019 = df_2019[df_2019['What is your gender? - Selected Choice']=='Female']\nfemale_2018 = df_2018[df_2018['What is your gender? - Selected Choice']=='Female']\nfemale_2017 = df_2017[df_2017['GenderSelect']=='Female']\n\n\n\ndf_2019['In which country do you currently reside?'].replace({'United States of America':'United States','Viet Nam':'Vietnam','China':\"People 's Republic of China\",\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\":'United Kingdom',\"Hong Kong (S.A.R.)\":\"Hong Kong\"},inplace=True)\n\ntopn = 10\n\ncount_male = male_2019['In which country do you currently reside?'].value_counts()[:topn].reset_index()\ncount_female = female_2019['In which country do you currently reside?'].value_counts()[:topn].reset_index()\n\npie_men = go.Pie(labels=count_male['index'],values=count_male['In which country do you currently reside?'],name=\"Men\",hole=0.5,domain={'x': [0,0.46]})\npie_women = go.Pie(labels=count_female['index'],values=count_female['In which country do you currently reside?'],name=\"Women\",hole=0.5,domain={'x': [0.52,1]})\n\nlayout = dict(title = 'Top-10 countries with respondents', font=dict(size=12), legend=dict(orientation=\"h\"),\n              annotations = [dict(x=0.2, y=0.5, text='Men', showarrow=False, font=dict(size=20)),\n                             dict(x=0.8, y=0.5, text='Women', showarrow=False, font=dict(size=20)) ])\n\nfig = dict(data=[pie_men, pie_women], layout=layout)\npy.iplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Comparison of number of respondents w.r.t the previous surveys\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lQOxGmQA8cNq73oErNqB-Q.png)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
