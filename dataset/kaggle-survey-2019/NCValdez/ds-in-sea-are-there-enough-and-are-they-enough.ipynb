Teach?\"\n\nEntering the University of the Philippines in 2006, these are the questions I would get from aunts and uncles after telling them that I was taking a degree in Physics. Early in my university days, the response usually would be \"Teaching would be nice.\" Coming from a developing country with a relatively small science and technology industry, pursuing a Physics degree is uncommon. My batch of Physics undergraduates numbered in the tens (as compared to other \"more professional\" courses which numbers in the hundreds).\n\nMotivated by love for the field, I finished my degree, uncertain what opportunities would open to me after I graduated. Fast forward to 2019, I am now a Physicist by training, a Data Scientist by profession and a Teacher at heart (which means whenever the opportunity presents itself).\n\nRecently, I have taught some beginner programming classes to aspiring data scientist. The large number of students is not surprising as the demand for the role has increased. However, from my experience in trying to find people to add to our team and from my experience with recruiters letting me know of a new potential role, I know that the number of practitioners are not enough.

This enabled me to transition to the DS industry relatively easily.\n\nThat doesn't mean I can rely only on my university courses to do well with work. We all know that data science is a field that requires knowledge on a vast range of topics. I make it a point to keep on exploring approaches and fields that I have not yet tried (which is a lot!). One of my most memorable courses is Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course from Coursera where I took pleasure in stopping the videos to derive the equations.\n\nA similar behavior can be seen from our kagglers, where most people seek out coursera as their learning platform.

Here are some key realizations:\n\n* <b>Ripe for Technological Advancements.</b> The region is experiencing a digital shift that is a prime time for the implementation of DS/AI. Companies are starting to embrace the adoption of more data-driven and technologically advance solutions. This presents opportunities a plenty.\n* <b>Different Pace, Same direction.</b> Southeast asian countries are experiencing the same growth and improvement. However, there are still a lot of disparity in terms of technological advancements and (surprisingly) even in gender disparity. Singapore is the hub for the region while the other countries are still catching up. These differences across countries in the region should present itself as an opportunity for countries to learn from one another.\n* <b>Young Talent Should be Honed.</b> DS/AI talent, albeit young, is present in the region. The number of individuals seeking courses for training suggest that the younger generation is interested in the field. Private companies are enticing these individuals, but government agencies should be able to push the country as a whole towards DS/AI adoption.\n\nI admit that my sources are not enough to paint a genuine landscape of the region. However, it gives us the puzzle pieces of a bigger picture. Hopefully, other SEA kagglers (especially those in underrepresented markets) can read this and share their own experiences.\n\nThank you so much for reading my notebook!
