As a business/data analyst who is in the middle of transition to data science, I found this challenge exciting and took it on. Several things led me to focus my analysis on exploring the differences between three job titles: business analyst, data analyst and data scientist.  \n\nFirst of all, whenever I talk about my career pursuit, I hear the following questions: what is a data scientist? Isn't it just another name for data analyst? Don't business analysts and data scientists do the same things? The confusion can be partially explained by the novelty of the term. If we look at the *interest over time* metric on Google Trends (*Figure 1*) for these three job titles, we see that there was almost zero interest in the term \"data scientist\" before 2012. Since then, the interest has quadrupled. Judging by this trend, it is quite plausible that soon there will be more people searching for \"data scientist\" than for \"business analyst\", which is still the most searched for among these three terms today.\n\nAnother reason that made me choose this topic is the fact that my friends and I are not the only ones wondering. The question [What is the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-data-analyst-and-a-data-scientist-1/log) on Quora got more than 100 answers and 375K views.\n\nI hope that my analysis of the Kaggle survey results will bring some clarity to the matter and answer the question of whether \"data scientist\" is just a fancier job title or if it is indeed a different role."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set_style('whitegrid')\n#color coding the roles\nroles = ['Business Analyst','Data Analyst','Data Scientist']\nroles_c = {'Business Analyst':'#CAD49D', 'Data Analyst': '#8D89C0', 'Data Scientist':'#1F78B4'}\nsingle_color = '#1F78B4'\n\n\ngoogle_trends = pd.read_csv(\"../input/google-trends-data-scientist-comparison/GoogleTrends-DS-DA-BA.csv\")\ngoogle_trends = google_trends.set_index(\"Month\")\ngoogle_trends = google_trends.rename(columns={\n    'business analyst: (Worldwide)':'Business Analyst', 'data analyst: (Worldwide)' :'Data Analyst',\n       'data scientist: (Worldwide)':'Data Scientist'})\n\ngoogle_trends.loc[google_trends['Data Scientist']=='<1']\ngoogle_trends['Data Scientist'] = google_trends['Data Scientist'].replace('<1',0.9)\ngoogle_trends = google_trends.astype(float)\ngoogle_trends.index = pd.to_datetime(google_trends.index,format='%Y-%m')\n\ncolors = list(roles_c.values())\nc_palette = sns.color_palette(colors)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 5))\nax = sns.lineplot(data=google_trends, palette=c_palette, dashes = False)\nax.set(xticks=pd.date_range(start=google_trends.index.min(), end=google_trends.index.max(), freq='12M'),xlabel = 'Year')\nax.grid(False)\nax.xaxis.set_label_text(\"\")\nax.tick_params(labelsize=12)\nannotation_text = (\"Figure \"+next(fig_n)+\": Worldwide interest in selected search terms from 2004 until present\"\n                  +\"\\nSource: Google Trends\\n100 is the peak popularity for the term. 50 means that the term is half as popular. 0 means not enough data\")\nsns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)\nplt.annotate(annotation_text, (0,0), (0, -40), xycoords='axes fraction', textcoords='offset points', va='top', ha='left', fontsize=11)\nplt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Navigation\n* [Setting the scene for the analysis](#section-data-preparation)\n* [You are never too young or too old for anything](#section-age)\n* [Everyone is a scientist at heart, but some also have a doctoral degree](#section-education)\n* [Who does what?

Let's explore this further.\n\nEveryone who said that their employer incorporates machine learning methods into their business were asked about activities that make up an important part of their role at work. Respondents were given a list of 6 activities, from which they could choose none, some or all activities. From their answers we can't say what portion of their day-to-day work each activity takes up, but we can get an idea of whether they are involved in certain types of tasks.\n\n\nI grouped these activities into 3 major categories:\n1. Data Analysis related: \n    * \"Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions\"\n2. Data Infrastructure related:\n    * \"Build and/or run the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data\"\n3.  Machine learning related: \n    * \"Build prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas\"\n    * \"Build and/or run a machine learning service that operationally improves my product or workflows\"\n    * \"Experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models\"\n    * \"Do research that advances the state of the art of machine learning\"\n\nLooking at figure 7a, we can conclude that analyzing data is an important part of every role. Activities related to machine learning are performed by the majority of data scientists (~90%), whereas only half of data analysts and business analysts (~53%) are involved in machine learning.\n\nFigure 7b provides a detailed view of those who selected at least one of the activities related to machine learning"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\"

To make the comparison meaningful, we should look at each country separately. However, it is problematic to do so for data analysts and business analysts, as we have too few responses. Luckily, in some countries we do have enough data for data scientists, so we'll look at them.\n\nOn its own, information about salaries lacks an anchor. What does it mean to earn $ 40K+ in Japan? Is it good? To level the field, I decided to use information from the McDonald's Big Mac prices in each country and translate yearly compensation to the number of Big Macs you can buy. The Big Mac index was invented by *the Economist* and is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the US is in the lead in terms of salaries, no matter which \"currency\" you measure average yearly compensation in. Brazil is at the bottom of the salary ranking. Despite the fact that on average data scientists in Russia make half as much money in USD as those in Germany, they are able to buy the same number of Big Macs in their home country.

Then, study machine learning algorithms, as this is another area where data scientists stand out from business analysts and data analysts.
