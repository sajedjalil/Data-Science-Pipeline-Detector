After working for several years in the industry I decided to take a short break, go back to academics and pursue higher education. No doubt, it was one of the best learning experiences I had best but there was also a huge investment of time and money. Many people contact me regularly asking about my experience and viewpoint about such degrees. They often ask questions like - *whether is it worth spending huge chunks of money for such degrees?* Well, there is no fixed answer for these type of questions because every individual will have a different viewpoint and their opinion might be biased. The best way to answer this question is to make use of data and analyse the cohorts of people who are well settled in the industry (example - data scientists). Then compare the difference in their roles, position, responsibilities, and annual compensation. This type of analysis can provide many interesting insights and help in looking at the broader view of the problem. In this notebook, I decided to take a stab at this scenario and share my experience along with the analysis of Kaggle's annual data science survey data.\n\n\nSource: Upslash\nThere is one set of people who wants to pursue higher education degrees due to their passion and interest. For these people, it makes sense to get enrol in the relevant university courses and pursue their passion. On the other hand, there is another set of people, who wants to get these degrees to get a specific job title, or specific job roles that help them make more money. For this group, I consider that university courses are not just the only way to achieve these objectives.\n\nThe most obvious example is in the field of **Data Science**. In recent years, higher education degrees are sought as one of the pathways to become Data Scientist. It is not astonishing that Data Scientist is one of the fastest-growing job titles across the globe. The demand for skilled data scientists is increasing and this has given the universities an option to attract students and make huge amounts of money. Several universities have started dedicated higher education degrees specialized in data science and analytics. Those want to become a data scientist or to switch from another profession to data science profession are now strongly considering these university degrees as the only pathway.\n\nBut these university courses are not easy to get in and affordable for everyone. These degrees don’t come for free, tuition fees can be exorbitant and can range anything from USD 30,000 to USD 100,000. And that doesn’t include the actual cost of living. Many consider applying for student loans but they add a huge lump sum to the existing mountain of debts. A common myth is that the earning potential for those with postgraduate qualifications is higher but of course, there is no guarantee that one will get a stable job at the end of it. Additionally, Pursuing a university’s higher degree takes anything from one to three years, depending on different factors. This can seem like a long time, especially when the fellow peers getting started on their careers, while one is still studying.\n\nThe question of interest here is - does one need to get that expensive higher education degree, do they create a difference from those who do not have university degrees?. Some resources online also suggest that one can get the depth of knowledge, variety of skills and learn something new. But again, is it possible to get the same skills, same profile, or even better compensation without such degrees?.\n\n\n\nKaggle conducted their Annual Data Science survey and it was full of interesting questions. Participants of this survey were asked different questions about their demographics, profiles, companies, what they use etc. I analysed this data intending to dig deeper into the profiles of people who completed the university degrees and those who did not. The focus of the story in this notebook is to identify if the working data scientists with official higher education degrees differ significantly from the other group. The analysis and storyline are segmented according to different factors.\n\nNote - For the analysis, I removed the respondents who were \"students\" and who was \"not employed\". The two groups were selected based on the respondent's choice if they completed the university degrees or not.\n\nContents\n\n1.

Key Features that differentiate two groups\n\n1. Sources of Learning Data Science\nData science skills are difficult to obtain, but nowadays there are many online and offline which teaches them in detail. While some prefer online courses such as Coursera or Udacity, some prefer to go to universities for a year or two-year long dedicated courses. Let's look at what are the most popular sources of learning data science among the respondents of the kaggle survey. In this question, one participant could have chosen multiple choices, hence the x-axis represents \"percentage\" of respondents who selected a particular choice."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"About 44% of the respondents selected \"Coursera\" as the primary source of learning data science. Coursera is the popular online learning platform which provides both free courses and paid specializations.\nCoursera and its founder Andrew NG have made very significant contributions to the data science revolution. Back in 2012, Andrew NG released the very popular Machine Learning course which became the first choice for many to learn data science. In 2017, Deeplearning.ai was launched and it became very popular data science specialization. These courses and many others from well known academic names on the online platform makes Coursera as the primary choice among the data science enthusiasts.\nThe search results for Coursera data science page says that there are 1054 courses about Data Science as of Dec 2019.\n\nKaggle Learn was selected by almost one-fourth of the respondents. Kaggle team launched these courses somewhere around early 2017. They are composed of notebook style materials which not only focusses on teaching the concepts but also the programming part as well.\nThen there are other sources such as Udemy, Udacity, edX, fast.ai etc. These platforms als provide online materials and courses to learn data science.\n\nThen there is a group of individuals who prefer to go to a university to pursue higher education degrees. Among the survey participants, about one-fifth of the participants had completed university degrees. Accoding to multiple sources ( Masters-And-More, Uniplaces, CareerAdditct, MyBaggage ) different individuals have many different reasons to choose university courses over online courses. The most common are:\n\nPersonal Goal\nBetter Salary\nGain More Knowledge\nBetter Job Roles\nCareer Change\nDesigning My Own Survey : Why People Choose Higher Education Degrees\nMy personal reason for engaging in a higher education degree was majorly driven by passion and interest, it was a personal goal of mine to get another degree after the bachelors. But I was curious to know why other individuals decide to pursue a higher education degree. I created my own survey to know the student's choices this question and shared it in several groups associated with National University of Singapore. I managed to get about 120 responses from different people for this survey.\n\nLink of the Survey: Survey\nLink of the Responses: Responses\n\nFollowing is the response distribution of the Question."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## load libraries\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import Counter \nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly import tools\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \nimport plotly \nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n## load data and remove (students, not-employed)\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv\", low_memory = False)\ndf = df[~df['Q5'].isin([\"Student\", \"Not employed\"])]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## function to identify value counts of a column responses presented in multiple other columns\ndef summate_columns(col, xaxis_def=None):\n    xaxis, yaxis1 = [], []\n    for i in range(1, 20):\n        if col+'_Part_'+str(i) not in df:\n            break\n        \n        doc = dict(df[col+'_Part_'+str(i)].value_counts())\n        if len(doc) > 0:\n            key = list(doc.keys())[0]\n        else:\n            continue \n        xaxis.append(key)\n        \n        if key in doc:\n            yaxis1.append(doc[key])\n        else:\n            yaxis1.append(0)\n            \n    if xaxis_def != None:\n        xaxis = xaxis_def\n    \n    xaxis = xaxis[::-1]\n    xaxis = [_.split(\"(\")[0]+\"    \" for _ in xaxis]\n    yaxis1 = [x*100/len(df) for x in yaxis1][::-1]\n\n    temp_df = pd.DataFrame()\n    temp_df['xaxis'] = xaxis\n    temp_df['yaxis'] = yaxis1\n    temp_df = temp_df.sort_values(\"yaxis\")\n    temp_df['colors'] = ['#fad46b']*len(temp_df)\n    colors = np.array(temp_df['colors'])\n    colors[-3], colors[-2], colors[-1] = \"#97c6e8\", \"#97c6e8\", \"#97c6e8\"\n    colors[-4] = \"red\"\n    \n    annotations = []\n    for yd, xd in zip(xaxis, yaxis1):\n        annotations.append(dict(xref='x', yref='y',\n                            x=xd+2, y=yd,\n                            text=str(round(xd, 1)) + '%',\n                            font=dict(family='Arial', size=14, color='black'),\n                            showarrow=False))\n    \n    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Bar(name='', y=temp_df['xaxis'], x=temp_df['yaxis'], orientation='h', marker=dict(color=colors, opacity=0.6))], \n                    layout = go.Layout(title=\"Sources of Learning Data Science\", plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff', margin=dict(l=100), \n                                       width=900, height=500, legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.1)))\n    fig.update_layout(barmode='group')\n    \n    annotations += [go.layout.Annotation(x=40, y=9, xref=\"x\", yref=\"y\", text=\"(Most Popular)\", showarrow=False, arrowhead=7, ax=0, ay=-40)]\n    \n    fig.update_layout(annotations=annotations)\n    fig.update_xaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, title=\"% of respondents\")\n    fig.update_yaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False)\n    fig.add_shape(go.layout.Shape(type=\"rect\", xref=\"x\", yref=\"paper\", x0=22, x1=48.6, y0=0.75, y1=1, fillcolor=\"gray\", opacity=0.2, layer=\"below\", line_width=0))\n    fig.show()\n    \nsummate_columns(\"Q13\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d = {\n        'Gain More Knowledge': 69.7,\n        'Better Job Roles': 34.5,\n        'Personal Goal': 26.2,\n        'Career Change': 41.8,\n        'Better Salary': 43.5,\n}\n\nxx = [\"Personal Goal\", \"Better Salary\", \"Gain More Knowledge\", \"Better Job Roles\", \"Career Change\"]\nxx = [_ + \"<br>(\" +str(d[_])+ \"%)\" for _ in xx]\nyy = [\"\"]*len(d)\nzz = [13.7, 63, 100, 40, 56]\ncc = ['red', 'green', 'purple', 'orange', \"blue\"] \n\ntrace1 = go.Scatter(x = xx, y = [\"\"]*len(d), mode='markers', name=\"\", marker=dict(color=cc, opacity=0.4, size = zz))\nlayout = go.Layout(barmode='stack', height=300, margin=dict(l=100), title='Reasons for pursuing University Degrees',\n                   legend = dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.15), plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff', \n                   showlegend=False)\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=[trace1], layout=layout)\niplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Most of the people decided to pursue higher education degrees to gain more knowledge.

Every two out of five people decided to pursue university degrees to get better salaries or to change their professions. Only about one-fourth of individuals had their own personal goal to go for a university degree.\nIf we just look at the number of individuals who selected \"gain more knowledge\", the same but important question arises again: \"Is it worth spending a huge amount of money to gain knowledge that one can get from free sources?\" Arent' the free online sources good enough to gain more knowledge. Or, Can't these sources provide enough skills and knowledge to get that better salary, better job roles, or provide a pathway for a career change.\nThe interesting fact to note that most of the online courses on Coursera, Udemy etc. are also from the same universities or the same professors. Many of them are free as well. So if \"gaining more knowledge\" is the only goal then it is worth considering these free courses.\n\nThe Academic Landscape : Masters in Data Science Degrees\nWhatever be the debate but one point is definitely clear, Universities across the globe do benefit a lot from this increased interest in higher education degrees. Many universities have now started specialized masters degree programs in analytics, data science, business analytics etc. The following chart shows some of the popular master's degree programmes from US universities along with their tuition fee and duration. Some of them are provided online, but the same are also provided on campus.\n\nSource of Data : https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/best-masters-data-science-analytics-online.html"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"university_data = \"\"\"CMU Tepper\t67575\t24\nUC Berkeley\t66150\t20\nGeorgia Tech\t9900\t23\nIllinois-Urbana\t19200\t17.5\nSouth California\t55886\t24\nWisconsin\t30600\t17.5\nBoston Metropolitan\t34400\t24\nJohns Hopkins\t53740\t17.5\nPennsylvania State\t29250\t17.5\nNorthwestern SPS\t53148\t18\nRutgers\t23136\t24\nUCD Dublin\t7575\t36\nTexas A&M\t65000\t24\nArizona State\t39622\t15\nNortheastern\t34200\t24\nOhio\t35250\t20\nRice\t129000\t24\nIndiana Bloomington\t15172\t18\nNotre Dame\t48000\t21\nIIT Chicago\t30985\t16\nSyracuse\t54000\t24\nCalifornia Riverside\t24990\t13\nIowa State\t24000\t21\nOregon State\t23445\t17.5\nMissouri\t34000\t24\nCUNY SPS\t13200\t17.5\nAmerican\t54186\t15\nOklahoma\t26103\t14\nColorado\t39450\t24\nOklahoma State\t33990\t24\nBaker College\t17100\t17.5\nBay Path\t29340\t24\nBellevue\t20700\t17.5\nBlanchardstown\t2320\t24\nCapella\t33360\t12\nCentral Connecticut\t21681\t17.5\nColorado Technical\t28080\t24\nDePaul\t43160\t17.5\nDS TechInstitute\t7900\t9\nDakota State\t13320\t10\nElmhurst College\t25350\t24\nFull Sail\t28008\t12\nLa Salle\t26250\t20\nLewis\t26235\t24\nMaryville St. Louis\t22950\t17.5\nPhoenix\t29316\t17.5\nRegis\t25560\t17.5\nSaint Mary's College\t31946\t24\nSouth Dakota State\t13320\t12\nSaint Joseph's\t17520\t24\nSouthern Methodist\t57084\t28\nSouthern New Hampshire\t22572\t15\nSlippery Rock\t16269\t10\nAlabama Huntsville\t21810\t12\nMaryland College\t24984\t17.5\nVillanova\t43400\t24\nWest Virginia\t30690\t17.5\nNorthcentral\t30530\t23\nEdinburgh Napier\t9060\t33\nDrexel\t56925\t24\nMerrimack College\t28320\t16\nVarna Free\t5391\t12\nJohnson & Wales\t23744\t24\nKent State\t21524\t12\"\"\"\n\nuniversity_data = university_data.split(\"\\n\")\nudf = pd.DataFrame()\nudf['name'] = [_.split(\"\t\")[0] for _ in university_data]\nudf['tution'] = [float(_.split(\"\t\")[1]) for _ in university_data]\nudf['months'] = [float(_.split(\"\t\")[2]) for _ in university_data]\n\nudf1 = udf[udf['months'] > 6]\nudf1 = udf1[udf1['months'] < 25]\nudf1 = udf1[udf1['tution'] < 100000]\nudf1['name1'] = udf1.apply(lambda x : \"\" if x['months'] in [9, 12, 17.5, 24] else x['name'], axis = 1)\n\nfig = go.Figure([go.Bar(x=udf['name'], y=udf['tution'], orientation=\"v\", name=\"Tution Fee\", marker=dict(color=\"orange\", opacity=0.5), ),\n                 go.Scatter(x=udf['name'], name=\"Median Household Income\", y=[59000]*len(udf), mode=\"lines\", marker=dict(color=\"red\"), line=dict(dash='dash')) ])\nfig.update_layout(title=\"Tution Fee : University Degrees in Data Science\", plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff', legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.1), \n                 xaxis = dict(tickangle = 45), height=500)\nfig.show()\n\nfig = go.Figure([go.Bar(x=udf['name'], y=udf['months'], orientation=\"v\", marker=dict(color=\"#3498d5\", opacity=0.5, line=dict(color=\"#3498d5\")), name=\"Duration\"),\n                 go.Scatter(x=udf['name'], y=[12]*len(udf), mode=\"lines\", marker=dict(color=\"red\"), line=dict(dash='dash'), name=\"1 Yr\"), \n                 go.Scatter(x=udf['name'], y=[18]*len(udf), mode=\"lines\", marker=dict(color=\"blue\"), line=dict(dash='dash'), name=\"1.5 Yr\"), \n                 go.Scatter(x=udf['name'], y=[24]*len(udf), mode=\"lines\", marker=dict(color=\"orange\"), line=dict(dash='dash'), name=\"2 Yr\"), \n                ])\nfig.update_layout(title=\"Duration : University Degrees in Data Science\", plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff', legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.1),\n                   xaxis = dict(tickangle = 45), height=400)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Time and money are the two biggest investments associated with university degrees. The graph shows that the tuition fee for most of these courses is not cheap and the duration can range from anywhere 1 to 3 years depending upon specialization, location, and university type.\n\nThe university courses are of two types: Generic courses and Specializations. Generic courses are typically very comprehensive, they cover all parts of data science but they are not very deep and detailed. These type of courses are good for those who want to get acquainted with main elements of this field. The specializations, on the other hand, aim to cover every possible detail of one particular area. They are generally very deep. For both types of courses, the investment of money and time are always higher as compared to the alternative free ones. Additionally, these courses are never meant to teach everything and do the spoon-feeding. They are more like the guided paths, and it is mostly the self-effort along that path which makes the students learn. If guided correctly, even through the non-degree courses (such as the ones on coursera or kaggle learn etc), one may also get the same outcomes.\n\nHead of Data Science from Restaurant Technologies, Inc. shared, \"No single Masters Program could cover all the disciplines needed in significant depth for one to be an expert in all these areas.

Are there a Significant Differences - With or Without University Degrees ?\nAccording to Forbes, Most people with data science job titles don’t have these new degrees. I also looked at the profiles of a few data scientist in my Linkedin Network and observed that not all of them have data science degrees. People tend to take different paths - some have degrees in business, economics, maths etc, while some have specialed data science degrees, and some have no university degree. But all of them are working in good organizations with good job roles. In the next section, let's look at the key insights from the Survey Data Analysis. The focus of the analysis is to compare the two groups - individuals who completed university degree vs those without for becoming a data scientist, and measure the key differences (if any).\n\nMainly, We will look at three perspectives: Are there fairly equal percentage of individuals from two groups\n\nWith every compensation bracket.\nFor each type of job role or activity.\nFor each type of activity they do on the daily basis.\n3.1 Compensation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"col_yes = \"#fad46b\"\ncol_no = \"#97c6e8\"\n\ndef compute_stats(df, col, xaxis=None):\n    agg_df = df[col].value_counts().to_frame()\n    total = sum(agg_df[col])\n    agg_df['percent'] = agg_df[col].apply(lambda x : 100*x / total)\n    agg_df = agg_df.reset_index().rename(columns = {col: \"count\", 'index' : col})\n    agg_doc = {}\n    if xaxis != None:\n        for _ in xaxis:\n            try:\n                agg_doc[_] = agg_df[agg_df[col] == _]['percent'].iloc(0)[0]\n            except:\n                agg_doc[_] = 0\n    return agg_doc\n\ndef plot_ver_bars(c, ht=500, annot = True):\n    dxf1 = df1[df1['Q5'].isin([\"Data Scientist\"])]\n    dxf2 = df2[df2['Q5'].isin([\"Data Scientist\"])]\n\n    count_df1 = dxf1[dxf1[\"Q3\"].isin([c])]\n    count_df2 = dxf2[dxf2[\"Q3\"].isin([c])]\n    col = \"Q10\"\n    xaxis = [\"$0-999\", \"1,000-1,999\", \"2,000-2,999\", \"3,000-3,999\", \"4,000-4,999\", \"5,000-7,499\", \"7,500-9,999\", \"10,000-14,999\", \"15,000-19,999\", \"20,000-24,999\", \"25,000-29,999\", \"30,000-39,999\", \"40,000-49,999\", \"50,000-59,999\", \"60,000-69,999\", \"70,000-79,999\", \"80,000-89,999\", \"90,000-99,999\", \"100,000-124,999\", \"125,000-149,999\", \"150,000-199,999\", \"200,000-249,999\", \"250,000-299,999\", \"300,000-500,000\", \"> $500,000\"]\n    t1_doc = compute_stats(count_df1, col, xaxis=xaxis)\n    t2_doc = compute_stats(count_df2, col, xaxis=xaxis)\n\n    ## plot the bar chart\n    xaxis1 = [\"$0K\", \"1 - 1K\", \"2 - 2K\", \"3 - 3K\", \"4 - 4K\", \"5 - 7.5K\", \"7.5 - 10K\", \"10 - 15K\", \"15 - 20K\", \"20 - 25K\", \"25 - 30K\", \"30 - 40K\", \"40 - 50K\", \"50 - 60K\", \"60 - 70K\", \"70 - 80K\", \"80 - 90K\", \"90 - 100K\", \"100 - 125K\", \"125 - 150K\", \"150 - 200K\", \"200 - 250K\", \"250 - 300K\", \"300 - 500K\", \"> $500K\"]\n    fig = go.Figure(data=[\n                go.Bar(name='Without University Degree', x=xaxis1[7:], y=[t2_doc[_] for _ in xaxis][7:], marker=dict(color=col_no, opacity=0.8)),\n                go.Bar(name='With University Degree', x=xaxis1[7:], y=[t1_doc[_] for _ in xaxis][7:], marker=dict(color=col_yes, opacity=0.8))])\n    fig.update_layout(barmode='group', title=\"Data Scientists in <b>\"+c+\"</b>\", \n                      yaxis = dict(title=\"% of respondents\"), xaxis = dict(title=\"US$\"), height=ht,\n                      legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.1), plot_bgcolor='#fff', paper_bgcolor='#fff')\n                                 \n    fig.update_xaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False)\n    fig.update_yaxes(showgrid=False, zeroline=False)\n    if annot == True:\n        fig.update_layout(annotations=[go.layout.Annotation(x=15.5, y=13, xref=\"x\", yref=\"y\", \n                                                       text=\"More % of Individuals <br> Without University Degrees <br>Earning > $150K\", \n                                                       showarrow=True, arrowhead=7, ax=0, ay=-40), \n                                 go.layout.Annotation(x=11, y=24, xref=\"x\", yref=\"y\", \n                                                       text=\"With University Degrees <br> Earning More\", \n                                                       showarrow=True, arrowhead=7, ax=0, ay=-40)])\n        fig.add_shape(go.layout.Shape(\n                    type=\"rect\",\n                    xref=\"x\",\n                    yref=\"paper\",\n                    x0=12.5,\n                    x1=17.5,\n                    y0=0.03,\n                    y1=1,\n                    fillcolor=\"red\",\n                    opacity=0.1,\n                    layer=\"below\",\n                    line_width=0))\n        fig.add_shape(go.layout.Shape(\n                    type=\"rect\",\n                    xref=\"x\",\n                    yref=\"paper\",\n                    x0=10.5,\n                    x1=12.4,\n                    y0=0.5,\n                    y1=1,\n                    fillcolor=\"green\",\n                    opacity=0.1,\n                    layer=\"below\",\n                    line_width=0))\n    \n    \n    fig.show()\n    return count_df1, count_df2\n\nnations = [\"United States of America\", \"Germany\"]\nc1, c2 = plot_ver_bars(nations[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plot shows the percentage of respondents from the United States of America in each compensation bracket.

Identifying Key Traits\n\nLet's look at the what are the key characterisics of individuals who prefer to go to university. In this particular task, we aim to identify what are the most important signals strongly related to university degree holders. To identify these signals, we can treat this task as a predictive modelling problem. First we need to prepare the dataset and create the training and testing sets. We will train a simple random forest classifier in which the features are weather the individual used a particular tool / platform / framework / technique etc. and the target will be a binary variable - weather they completed university degree or not. These features capture information about their demographics, their roles, their companies etc and all of them are binary. Once the model is trained, the most important features of the model sorted accoriding to their importance will be used to identify key signals.
