On the other hand, as the majority of the continent's countries still falls under \"least developed country\" (LDC) status (see UNCTAD map below), the blossoming of ML in Africa presents tangible opportunities for improving the lives of millions (<b>Cisse 2018</b>).

In 2018, Google [announced](https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-africa/google-ai-ghana/) the opening of a Google AI research center in Accra, Ghana. The center's purpose is to focus on advancing our understanding of ML while, at the same time, develop practical ML applications addressing challenges in key sectors, such as healthcare, education, and agriculture. Likewise, [IBM Research–Africa](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/africa/) is IBM’s 12th global research lab and the first industrial research facility in the continent. The company opened its first African office in Nairobi, Kenya in 2013, followed by a second one in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2016.\n\n* **Major academic conferences move to Africa while AI learning initiatives are blossoming throughout the continent**. The [announcement](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/CallForPapers) that the eighth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020), one of the premier conferences in ML and AI, will take place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, received a lot of praise as a step towards fostering a more inclusive research environment. However, while the ICLR 2020 is widely regarded as the first major AI research conference that will take place in the African continent, notable AI learning initiatives have been paving the way for more than half a decade. The [Data Science Africa (DSA)](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/) annual summer schools and workshops, launched in 2013, have trained participants on ML and related methods and provided an avenue for researchers to present relevant work in the African context. Similarly, the [Deep Learning Indaba](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/), an annual meeting of the African Machine Learning community that began in 2017, has been featuring keynotes and tutorials by leading figures in the field, such as [Nando de Freitas](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/), [Jeff Dean](https://ai.google/research/people/jeff/), [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/) and [Shakir Mohamed](https://shakirm.com/).\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/09/Deep-Learning-Indaba-2017-group-1024x683.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"text-line:justify\">\nIn our view, the above developments suggest that the ML community in Africa has gathered great momentum, which we hope will keep rising in the future.

On the other hand, AI Leaders have a larger proportion of Kagglers in the 18-21 age bin (`18.5%`), as compared to African countries (`12.3%`). \n* Africa also has less coders aged 40 and above (`9%`) compared to the AI Leaders (`16.7%`).\n* The above comparison suggests that the depiction of Africa in the media as a source of \"young and enthusiastic talent\" may have indeed merit.\n\nAge distribution by country across African countries varies greatly. However, we can distinguish between three main broad patterns:\n* In Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco, a high proporation of the respondents falls within the 22-24 age bin (\"early twenties\"), followed by a likewise relatively high proportion of the population in the 25-29 age bin (\"late twenties\"). Tunisia is notable insofar as `52.9%` of the Kagglers who replied to the survey are in their early twenties. This patterns suggests that the coders in these countries are expected to have typically completed their college education and be in a position to currently join the workforce. On the other hand, these counties have a lower proportion in the \"college age\" age bin of 18-21.\n* South Africa and Algeria follow a somewhat similar pattern, with the difference that the highest majority of their population that answered the Kaggle questionnaire falls in the \"late twenties\" bin and the second highest falls into the \"early twenties\" one. Again, the proportion of the \"college age\" coders is relatively low (i.e., below `10%`). These countries also have significant numbers of coders in their \"early thirties\": `22.5%` of South Africa's coders and `19%` of Algeria's fall in the respective bin (30-34). As the workforce of these age categories can be expected to be more experienced professionally, this could suggest that these countries are good talent pools for large-scale ML and AI initiatives or managerial projects. \n* The other two countries, Kenya and Nigeria, are closer to the aggregate trend for African countries, insofar as the majority of their population is concentrated roughly equally in the first three bins (i.e., \"college age\", \"early twenties\" and \"late twenties.\")"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Gender (Distribution) <a id=\"gender\"></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> **Question 2**: What is your gender?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"parameters = {\n    'dfs' : [ai_leaders_africa, african_countries],\n    'strat_cols' : ['ai_leader', 'Q3'],\n    'quant_col' : 'Q2',\n    'title' : None,\n    'xaxis_titles' : [None]*2,\n    'yaxis_titles' : ['Percentage of respondents', None],\n    'rows' : 1,\n    'cols' : 2,\n    'horizontal_spacing' : 0.02,\n    'yaxis' : [0, 1.02],\n    'legend_y' : -0.15\n}\n\nfig = create_plotly_barchart(**parameters)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Gender distribution is very similar between Aftican countries and the AI Leaders, even though we observe a somewhat higher percentage of female coders among African Kagglers (`21%`) as compared to Kagglers from the AI Leaders (`16.8%`).\n\nWe observe greater heterogeneity in gender distribution across African countries.

In these countries the majority of respondents (`62.6%` in Egypt, `70%` in Kenya and `63.4%` in Morocco) report up to 2 years of experience while their distribution is roughly equal in the \"up to one year\" and \"1-2 years\" bins.

However, the distributions at the bin level are not equal, with Tunisia having more respondents in the \"1-2 years\" bin (`45.5%`) and Algeria and Nigeria more in the \"up to one year\" one (`20.5%` and `27.5%` respectively). The three countries also report the three highest proportions of Kagglers that have \"never written code\" (`10.3%` in Algeria, `13.7%` in Nigeria and `15.9%` in Tunisia).\n* South Africa has a unique distribution and stands out as its coders report more years of experience. The greatest proportion of the population (`26.5%`) has between 3 and 5 years of coding experience, while the second greatest (`22.5%`) between 1 and 2. South Africa also boasts a notable number of Kagglers with more than five years of coding experience (`29.4%`).

More specifically:\n* `35.9%` of African Kagglers report no lifetime ML expenditures whatsoever, compared to `29.6%` of Kagglers from AI Leaders.\n* `42.3%` of African Kagglers report ML expenditures up to USD 999 (i.e., either in the \"USD 1-99\" or \"USD 100-999\" bins) and `21.9%` report ML expenditures above USD 1,000.

However, such respondents are likely to be among the \"early adopters\" of ML and AI tools and, as a result, may not be representative with respect to the general population in Africa (e.g. the average technology user). Nevertheless, we do believe that studying the behavior of early adopters is crucial in understanding what drives adoption and influences how fast technology spreads.\n*\tAs discussed in our methodology section, our analysis is based on African countries that are very diverse both in terms of geography as well as socio-economic level. Most are countries either in the northern-most or southern-most regions of the continent. With only seven countries (which are also quite in diverse) from a continent of 54 countries, we cannot hope to have robust generalizations. We do, however, expect that countries that are similar to those analyzed in this notebook will probably exhibit similar patterns with respect to ML.\n*   We have not any of the responses whose country column has the value `Other` (recall that if a given country had fewer than 50 respondents it was converted to `Other` for anonymity). Presumably, some of the respondents in that subset of the data might be coming from African countries but we did not attempt to identify them using some clustering technique.\n*\tFor simplicity of analysis, we have not considered textual responses (i.e. those that the users did not select from a predetermined list but instead typed themselves) or responses such as \"Other\" or \"None\". In so doing, we acknowledge that we may have potentially missed out on valuable information."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusions and Recommendations <a id=\"conclusions\"></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"text-line:justify\"> Our exploration of the 2019 DS & ML datasets reveals a relatively optimistic picture of the status of ML in African countries, at least to the extent that African Kagglers are seen as a representative sample of coders in the continent. The average African Kaggler is young and enthusiastic about ML and AI. Despite the fact that most of the respondents have few years of general coding or machine learning experience and that “Africa has only recently started to catch up” with state-of-the art developments in ML, it is catching up fast! There are no \"significant gaps\" that need to be bridged in respect of using particular ML frameworks, software or hardware or any hints that would suggest that we need to promote particular educational platforms or DS media. </div>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n![](https://robohub.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bigstock-169283726.jpg)\n\nHowever, we have indeed identified a few notable factors that differentiate Africa from other countries leading the AI revolution:\n\n* First, as hinted above, the average African Kaggler tends to be younger and more inexperienced compared to the average Kaggler from an AI Leader. We suspect that this trend can be primarily attributed to the overall demographic trends in the continent. \n* Second, average Kagglers report fewer ML-related expenditures. The reasons here are more likely attributable to income inequality and other economic phenomena across African countries and the AI Leaders.\n* Third, while African Kagglers are on par with Kagglers from the AI Leaders with respect to the adoption of complicated techniques in NLP and computer vision, they seem to somewhat lag behind in the learning of “traditional” ML algorithms (e.g., regressions). This seems to suggest that African data scientists are fast to specialize or prefer learning “on the job” (as suggested by the somewhat low popularity of University courses). While this is not, in itself, a non-desirable outcome, we are of the view that firm adoption of ML throughout the continent can be more successfully pursued, if a larger part of the population is exposed to “the basics” of the discipline. \n\nGiven these above insights, we have come up with the following (broad) policy recommendations which, if adopted, could enhance the status of ML in Africa and lead to its “democratization” in individual African countries:\n\n* **Adapt educational curricula to incorporate basic coding and ML algorithms**: As already discussed, education is crucial in increasing adoption rates of ML. One of the key reasons why initiatives such as Africa Coding Week are very successful in this respect is that it includes school-aged children and development in its initiatives, while it aims to equip them with basic tools that are likely to stimulate further interest in the discipline. Local governments could adopt similar policies by incorporating computer science early on in the school curriculum and focusing (where age appropriate) on basic data science tools, statistics and regressions. Such efforts could increase interest in university-level ML courses, encourage more academic research and, ultimately, bring Africa at the intellectual forefront of the AI and ML community.\n* **Continue to encourage investment by global technology firms**: African regulators should prioritize the creation of an investment-friendly climate in order to attract more technology giants in the likes of Google and IBM (e.g., through fiscal incentives or simplification of administrative procedures for companies in the space). A scenario where different governments would engage in such a “race to the top” could lead up to policies with limited fiscal cost but great impact in terms of ML adoption. More technology companies in Africa could mean that any economic imbalance hindering ML innovation could be partly addresses by the market mechanism. After all, global technology employers are more likely to sponsor employees to attend University, in order to pick up hard skills, implement corporate-wide training programs, invest in ML expenditure or, in some cases, encourage their employees to pursue ML-related research.\n* **Subsidize smaller and local players that focus on ML investments**. Even though governments would be advised to prioritize policies intended to attract “BigTech” players, the importance of small, local entrepreneurs in spreading ML adoption should not be underestimated. Local entrepreneurship is crucial to the extent that it is more knowledgeable of challenges, opportunities and risks in a given country while is it often able to flexibly source creativity and talent. African country governments could thus examine incentives such as the provision of subsidies to local start-ups in the ML space or other incentives intended to facilitate their operations. Although such policies would arguably trigger larger fiscal costs, their implementation could lead to outcomes that indeed deliver of the promise to “tangibly improve the lives of millions” through AI and ML through the design of tailored and innovative applications.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References <a id=\"references\"></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Davide Strusani and Georges Vivien Houngbonon. 2019. _The role of Artificial Intelligence in Supporting Development in Emerging Markets_.
