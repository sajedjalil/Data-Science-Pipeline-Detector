Lets do some good!\n\nIts fitting that the deadline for this challenge comes on the eve of [GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), a day created during the busy holiday season to focus on giving back. Charities use this day to remind people not to forget the causes that need their money, time and attention. The people who start or work at these charities run the gamut from full time professionals devoted to fundraising, to a person who simply has a passionate interest in helping a cause that's dear to them. Their knowledge of how to raise money varies too in terms of experience, tools and resources. Perhaps there is no greater area where machine learning and data science can be employed to help so many achieve so much for the good of others.\n\n# Challenges for Charities\n\n2018 was a tough year for many charities. According to an [article](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Gifts-to-Charity-Dropped-17/246511) published earlier this year by The Chronicle of Philanthropy, the [Giving USA Foundation](https://givingusa.org/) estimates a total decline in 2018 U.S. giving of over 7 billion dollars.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 and subsequent great recession are likely factors for the 2008 decline.  A 2018 decline in giving might be a sign that the economy is heading towards a recession, but there are other reasons to consider.    \n\nOne of the reasons giving maybe down is because of the 2017 tax changes. According to [Forbes magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2019/06/18/charitable-giving-took-a-hit-due-to-tax-reform/#3184c5b6f6ff): \n> The chief reason: the doubling of the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) would mean it wouldn’t pay for many to itemize on their 2018 tax returns, and without a charitable contribution deduction, they’d be less inclined to give. New data shows the fear seems to have been proven out. Typically, individual giving will track with growth in GPD [Gross Domestic Product], which was pretty robust in 2018, and with growth in household income, which was also strong,’ said Rick Dunham, chair of the Giving USA Foundation. The tax changes may be why individual giving was flat overall.’\n\nCharities may also feel the effects of a bad stock market, as they did in 2018:\n\n<img align=\"left\" style=\"margin-left: -20px; height: 300px;\" \nsrc=\"https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/24/Photos/ZH/MW-GS378_stock__20181024171646_ZH.jpg?uuid=1ceb36f0-d7d2-11e8-97f7-ac162d7bc1f7\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Also, a growing number of charities are competing for scarce resources.

Here's a look at some of the opportunities for improvement and where it might make sense to apply Machine Learning and Data Science:\n\n### Donor Retention \nThe [Fundraising Effectiveness Project](http://afpfep.org/blog/fundraising-effectiveness-project-quarterly-fundraising-report-for-q4-2018/) has been collecting data on donor retention since 2006, and they have prioritized donor retention as a primary measure to improve fundraising effectiveness. Unfortunately, the situation has not improved greatly over the years: overall YTD Donor Retention at the end of 2018 fell 6.3% to 44.5%. Smaller charities are more likely to lose donors than larger ones because they are not equipped with the resources to keep them.\n\n<img align=\"left\" src=\"http://afpfep.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fepq42018.png\">\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have some opportunities to make it better with data science. \n\n- An automatic monthly giving program is perhaps the most effective way to increase donor retention that many charities have still yet to put into practice.  The capability is easy to acquire, but signing up donors takes time.  In this case, a supervised machine learning algorithm could be used to identify the donors that are the most likely to sign up for an automated monthly giving program so we can streamline their adoption.  \n- Supervised machine learning could also be used to model the probability that a donor will lapse, so a charity can prioritize their follow-ups and minimize losses. \n- A model for determining the next best action to take with a donor can be trained from a history of other donor actions with their results.  The lack of action history and their results might make this harder.  A charity should consider the use of a donor management system so that contact history and results can be captured for training.    \n\n### Donor Acquisition\nAccording to [DonorSearch](https://www.donorsearch.net/),one major gift can be the difference between a charity meeting its goal and that same organization coming up short. Successful charities understand this fact and know the significance of running a top-tier program. As with Donor Retention, we have [some opportunities](https://www.donorsearch.net/artificial-intelligence-for-nonprofits/) to use Machine Learning and Data Science to make it better. Here are some others:\n\n- Supervised learning could be used to model the lifetime value of acquired donors, so that candidate donors can be prioritized based on their value. This is even more powerful if the model can be trained with donors from multiple charities.  \n- Unsupervised machine learning could be used to cluster segments of candidates based on their similarity to each other, so a charity can strategize and make effective solicitation campaigns.   \n\n### Gift Optimization\nCharities could improve their growth in giving results by applying Machine Learning and Data Science for optimizing the best time and amount to ask the donor.\n\n- Supervised machine learning could be used to train a model with past ask amounts and their results, so that we can predict ask amounts that maximize contributions and minimize losses. This is especially effective with a monthly giving program.  \n- A model for determining the next best action to take could also work toward increasing gift amounts. \n\nSo there it is.  We have more than enough opportunities to make good use of Machine Learning and Data Science. Now lets explore how people in organizations are approaching their data science practice.  Specifically, we want to explore and fully understand the adoption, costs, tools, team composition, roles, practices and tools involved with applying Machine Learning and Data Science for a small organization like a charity.
