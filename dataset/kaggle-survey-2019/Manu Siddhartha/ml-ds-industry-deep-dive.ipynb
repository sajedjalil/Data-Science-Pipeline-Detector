Hardware Requirements\nWith the increasing demand in deep learning, the demand for better as well as sophisticated hardware has also increased. Several Tier I organisations like Intel, Nvidia and Alibaba, among others, are striving hard to bridge the gap between the software and hardware. The only way to build a sophisticated deep learning model is to use better hardware.\nBefore seeing the actual distribution of CPU, TPU and GPU lets see what is the basic difference among them.\n\nThe researchers made a cross-platform comparison in order to choose the most suitable platform based on models of interest. This can also be said as the key takeaways which shows that no single platform is the best for all scenarios. They are mentioned below\n\n- **TPU: Tensor Processing Unit** is highly-optimised for large batches and CNNs and has the highest training throughput.\n- **GPU: Graphics Processing Unit** shows better flexibility and programmability for irregular computations, such as small batches and nonMatMul computations.\n- **CPU: Central Processing Unit** achieves the highest FLOPS utilisation for RNNs and supports the largest model because of large memory capacity.\n\n[source](https://analyticsindiamag.com/tpu-vs-gpu-vs-cpu-which-hardware-should-you-choose-for-deep-learning/)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8rQm425/GPU.png)\n\nlets which hardware usage are on rise !!!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"  hardware_list = {\n    \"CPUs\": sum(~mcq.Q21_Part_1.isna()) * 100 / mcq.shape[0],\n    \"GPUs\": sum(~mcq.Q21_Part_2.isna()) * 100 / mcq.shape[0],\n    \"TPUs\": sum(~mcq.Q21_Part_3.isna()) * 100 / mcq.shape[0],\n    \"None\": sum(~mcq.Q21_Part_4.isna()) * 100 / mcq.shape[0],\n    \"Other\": sum(~mcq.Q21_Part_5.isna()) * 100 / mcq.shape[0]\n}\n\ndf_dl_hardware = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(hardware_list, orient=\"index\", columns=[\"hardware_percentage\"]).reset_index().rename(columns={\"index\": \"hardware\"})\ndf_dl_hardware.sort_values(\"hardware_percentage\", ascending=False, inplace=True)\nfig = px.bar(df_dl_hardware, x=\"hardware_percentage\", y=\"hardware\", orientation='h')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## CPUs are still leading the race while GPU usage is on the rise !!!\nThere is a lot of research and active work happening to think of ways to accelerate computing.** Google** is expected to come out with **Tensorflow Processing Units (TPUs)** later this year, which promises an acceleration over and above current GPUs.\nSimilarly **Intel** is working on creating faster FPGAs, which may provide higher flexibility in coming days. In addition, the offerings from Cloud service providers (e.g. AWS) is also increasing.
