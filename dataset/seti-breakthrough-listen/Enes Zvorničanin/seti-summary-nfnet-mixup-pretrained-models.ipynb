CNN's are an architecture typically used for image recognition and classification, but they can be applied for other tasks as well. It is very unlikely that some of the CNN models trained from scratch can be comparable with pre-trained ones. Thus, the rule of thumb when it is any image data classification task is the use of existing, <b>pretrained models</b>.<br><br>\n\nIn that sense, currently, state of the art achievements holds <b>NFNet</b> models <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06171.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06171.pdf</a>.\nUser-friendly notebook with PyTorch implementation of this model can be found here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/yasufuminakama/seti-nfnet-l0-starter-training\">https://www.kaggle.com/yasufuminakama/seti-nfnet-l0-starter-training</a>.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y7mCw5f.png\" alt=\"img1\"/>\n<center><i>NFNet comparison, Source: High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization.</i></center>\n<br>\n<b>Data augmentation</b> is a method used to increase the data set by adding synthetic samples generated from observations of the original data. It is a technique to improve machine learning models by introducing noise to the training set. Methods such as <b>rotation</b> and <b>cropping</b> are used as they can add variation and diversity in images. The example using `albumentations` package with <b>ResNet18d in PyTorch</b> are shown here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ttahara/seti-e-t-resnet18d-baseline\">https://www.kaggle.com/ttahara/seti-e-t-resnet18d-baseline</a>.<br><br>\n\nInteresting data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and encourage generalization are <b>coarse dropout and cutout</b>. They randomly remove rectangles from the images and gives a similar effect as the dropout layer in CNN. These methods with <b>EfficientNet in TF</b> are presented here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/awsaf49/seti-bl-tf-starter-tpu\">https://www.kaggle.com/awsaf49/seti-bl-tf-starter-tpu</a>.<br><br>\n\n<b>EfficientNet with Keras</b> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/usharengaraju/seti-eda-baseline-tensorflow-and-tpu\">https://www.kaggle.com/usharengaraju/seti-eda-baseline-tensorflow-and-tpu</a> and even simpler here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/mrigendraagrawal/tf-spatial-seti-breakthrough-listen-starter\">https://www.kaggle.com/mrigendraagrawal/tf-spatial-seti-breakthrough-listen-starter</a>.<br><br>\n\nSimple <b>EfficientNet starter in PyTorch</b> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/micheomaano/simple-yet-effectiveb0-lb-0-96\">https://www.kaggle.com/micheomaano/simple-yet-effectiveb0-lb-0-96</a>.<br><br>\n\nUsing <b>PyTorch Image Models (timm)</b> <a href=\"https://fastai.github.io/timmdocs/\">https://fastai.github.io/timmdocs/</a> can be easily created pretrained model with several lines of code.<br><br>\n\n<blockquote style=\"background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;\">Timm is a deep-learning library created by Ross Wightman and is a collection of SOTA computer vision models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations and also training/validating scripts with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results</blockquote>\n<blockquote style=\"background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;\">It is that simple to create a model using timm.

The original paper states that this technique improves the generalization error of state-of-the-art models on ImageNet and CIFAR. Also, it helps to combat memorization of corrupt labels, sensitivity to adversarial examples, and instability in adversarial training (adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that have been intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake).

From the comparative study, it seems that the <b>mixup</b> can give a significant increase in the score <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/245152\">https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/245152</a>.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j6R66v9.png\" alt=\"img1\"/>\n<center><i>Mixup augumentation, Source: <a href=\"https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/\">https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/</a></i></center>\n<br>\nWhile CNN's are standard models with tasks on images, transformers are not yet common in this field. However, there are some promising works trying to utilize transformers for image-based tasks. <b>Vision Transformer (ViT)</b> is one of them. First, it divides a given input image into patches. These patches are then sequentially passed through a linear projection layer that has a role of an embedding layer. After that, position information is added\nto the embedding vectors and fed into the standard transformer. <b>ViT with PyTorch and timm</b> is presented here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/heyytanay/pytorch-training-augments-vit-kfolds\">https://www.kaggle.com/heyytanay/pytorch-training-augments-vit-kfolds</a>.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/i2kJ29F.jpg\" alt=\"img1\"/>\n<center><i>ViT, Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B6q4xnuFUE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B6q4xnuFUE</a></i></center>\n<br>\nBesides CNNs and transformers, one more architecture that is proposed in this competition is <b>bidirectional GRU</b>. This is a recurrent neural network that has a slightly simpler mechanism than LSTM. Classic implementation with Keras can be found here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/seti-bidirectional-gru-in-keras\">https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/seti-bidirectional-gru-in-keras</a>.<br><br>\n\nUsually what brings high scores in competitions is using ensemble models.
